<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/15/2024 [AM]</h2>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> July 15, 2024</p>
<p>In a conversation on the War Room, Jeff Clark discussed the dismissal of a significant classified documents case, involving for President Donald Trump. Clark praised Judge Cannon’s ruling, calling it a monumental decision that highlighted the unconstitutionality of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office under the appointments clause. Clark argued that Smith’s appointment violated the law because, unlike regular U.S. attorneys, he did not undergo Senate confirmation. Clark emphasized the thoroughness of Judge Cannon’s 93-page opinion, which addressed the unconstitutional appointment and Smith’s misuse of public funds. He also noted that the depth of her ruling proved critics of Cannon wrong. Natalie Winters inquired about the broader implications of this ruling on Trump’s legal battles and his opponents’ strategies. Clark and Mike pointed out that Trump’s opponents are unlikely to give up and will continue their efforts against him. They emphasized the need for Trump’s supporters to defend him against these tactics. Clark also criticized that the Justice Department operates independently of the President, arguing that it should be under presidential oversight. He attributed the flawed special counsel regulations from the Clinton administration to Neil Katyal and reiterated the need for constitutional adherence in creating government offices. Clark concluded by providing information on how to follow his work and stay updated with his writings and the Center for Renewing America.  Natalie Winters and Brian Glen discussed the kickoff of the RNC convention in Milwaukee, emphasizing the need for heightened security due to threats from leftist groups. They stressed the importance of supporting Trump’s 2024 campaign to defeat various enemies, including communists and globalists. Glen recounted his experience at a recent Trump rally where an assassination attempt on Trump occurred. Despite the heavy security presence, the event highlighted significant security lapses, with local police being blamed. The discussion also covered the transformation of the RNC into a MAGA-focused entity, celebrating the influence of Trump’s movement. They criticized the Biden administration for security failures and incompetence. The segment concluded with a tribute to veterans and a call to support the Disabled American Veterans organization.  In Milwaukee for the RNC Convention, Ben Bergquam interviews Republican Congressman Burgess Owens, discussing their enthusiasm for the event and President Trump’s 2024 campaign. Owens highlights the significance of the convention, emphasizing Trump’s defiance, courage, and love for America. They address the recent assassination attempt on Trump, critiquing media figures like Joy Reid for inciting violence with their rhetoric. Owens asserts that Americans, tired of negativity and division, are yearning for unity and hope, which Trump embodies. He believes the media’s bias has led to their loss of credibility and that Americans are now holding them accountable for their dishonesty. Owens expresses optimism for the future, predicting victories in the House and Senate and a Trump presidency, which he believes will bring positive policy changes and a renewed sense of hope. Bergquam notes the shift in support from black and Hispanic communities towards Trump, which Owens attributes to a desire for freedom and a positive future. Owens concludes by praising the influx of America First legislators in Congress, reflecting a broader movement towards traditional American values and unity.  Mike Davis joins Natalie Winters to discuss the recent legal victory for President Trump. Judge Eileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Trump, ruling that the special counsel’s office is unconstitutional. Davis explains that the U.S. Constitution requires new officers or taxpayer money spending to be approved by Congress, which wasn’t done in this case. He emphasizes that Congress allowed the independent counsel statute to lapse after the Ken Starr investigation of Clinton, but the Justice Department attempted to bypass this by creating the special counsel’s office through regulation. This office operates with little oversight and an unlimited budget, which Cannon deemed unconstitutional. Davis believes the Biden Justice Department may attempt to bring the case again through a U.S. attorney who is appropriately appointed and confirmed. Jeff Clark joins via Skype, calling the ruling monumental and praising Cannon for her detailed 93-page opinion. He criticizes the media for previously dismissing concerns about the special counsel’s constitutionality and highlights Justice Thomas’s concurrence in a related case as influential in Cannon’s decision. Clark argues that the Justice Department’s actions represent an unconstitutional overreach, reminiscent of historical grievances against the British monarchy. Davis and Clark agree that Trump’s opponents won’t relent despite this setback, predicting continued legal and political challenges. They stress the importance of defending Trump against what they see as politically motivated lawfare. Davis also discusses his role in helping draft a streamlined America First RNC platform, emphasizing its appeal to a broad coalition of voters.  Natalie Winters and Matt Taylor discuss the upcoming film “Government Gangsters,” set to debut this week at the RNC, which highlights the influence of career bureaucrats, termed as the “Deep State,” within U.S. government agencies. The film, based on Kash Patel’s book, aims to expose the deep state’s use of a two-tier justice system against figures like Donald Trump, and events such as Russiagate and the Hunter Biden laptop saga. Taylor, who played a key role in the film’s creation, expresses excitement for its screening at the RNC in Milwaukee on July 19th and emphasizes the film’s comprehensive coverage of deep state attacks over the past eight years. He highlights the film’s goal of educating viewers on the corruption within high-level government officials. Taylor acknowledges the expected resistance from media and Washington insiders due to the film’s controversial content. He recounts his experience with similar projects, including collaborations with Steve Bannon and films on Clinton and Hunter Biden, which also faced significant pushback. Despite these challenges, Taylor and his team are prepared for the backlash, believing the public deserves to know the truth about unelected bureaucrats influencing their lives. The film’s release is being promoted on warroomfilm.com, with pre-orders available. Taylor concludes by encouraging viewers to attend the screening or pre-order the film to understand the mechanics of the deep state and its impact on American politics.  Jm Hoft from Gateway Pundit discusses his newest media project, a new website launching today.  Natalie Winters introduces Congressman Andy Ogles, a member of the House Oversight Committee, recalling their past interaction at a conservative club in Tennessee. Ogles shares his experience as a county executive during COVID-19, where he kept his community open, defying mandates based on his interpretation of state law and his constitutional duty. He traveled to Tennessee with Tennessee Stands to educate other executives and mayors on their rights, keeping most communities open. Ogles briefly touches on an upcoming House Oversight Committee hearing with the Secret Service director, highlighting unanswered questions regarding a recent security lapse. He hints at a blame game between the Secret Service and local law enforcement, stressing the need for accountability. Winters agrees, noting the public’s desire for answers and accountability from the committee’s work. They plan to delve deeper into these issues after the break. </p>
