<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/3/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 4, 2024</p>
<p>Natalie Winters hosted the evening WarRoom program, and Steve Bannon hosted the Wednesday evening WarRoom Battleground program. Highlights: Each segment covers different aspects of political, legal, and grassroots efforts related to various issues, including immigration, free speech, energy policy, and election funding. Full show in segments: The conversation between WarRoom host Natalie Winters and Monica Crowley mainly focused on President Trump’s recent remarks, particularly on illegal immigration and the border situation. Crowley emphasized the gravity of the issue, stating that it has become the number one concern across all demographic groups in the country. Crowley highlighted the contrast between Trump’s approach to border control and the current situation under President Biden, suggesting that this issue alone could significantly influence the upcoming election. Winters and Crowley discussed potential strategies that Democrats might employ to counteract the negative perception of their handling of immigration, such as deflecting attention to other issues like abortion or attempting to make the election a referendum on Trump. However, Crowley expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of these tactics, arguing that the widespread impact of the border crisis is driving a political realignment among traditionally Democratic constituencies. Additionally, Crowley discussed her podcast, where listeners can find her analysis on various platforms, including Apple, Google, Spotify, and Stitcher, and her social media channels, where she shares her written pieces and updates on her work.  Todd Bensman discussed the intricacies of the NGO’s involvement in the situation at the southern border, emphasizing the gravity of the issue. He described the massive influx of migrants, noting that the numbers were enough to replace the entire population of several states. Bensman reported from Mexico, detailing the crackdown on migration flows by the Mexican government, which he attributed to a secret diplomatic deal likely aimed at influencing the 2024 election. He contrasted President Trump’s and President Biden’s approaches to Mexico, highlighting Trump’s use of aggressive trade tariffs to pressure Mexico into cooperation on border issues. In contrast, Biden’s administration promised financial aid to address the root causes of migration, which Bensman criticized as ineffective. He suggested that the Biden administration’s approach lacked leverage and could potentially involve corrupt dealings. He also discussed Texas’s efforts to reinforce its border infrastructure in response to the influx of migrants, highlighting extensive fortifications along the riverbank, mentioning witnessing migrants attempting to breach the barriers and emphasizing the seriousness of Texas’s preparations for potential future challenges. To access Todd’s footage and further information on the border situation, he directed people to his social media profiles, particularly on X and Getter, where he regularly shares updates and content related to the border.  Steve Bannon opened the segment by referencing the movie Braveheart and comparing Scotland’s historic resilience and intellectual contributions to the modern world. The discussion then shifted to a serious topic regarding hate speech laws in Scotland. Peter Mcilvenna appeared with Bannon and explained that the Scottish Parliament had passed the new Scottish Hate Crime and Public Order Bill, criminalizing speech that stirs up hatred based on various characteristics. The bill was pushed through by the Scottish National Party and received significant support from other parties. The legislation has raised concerns among free speech advocates, comedians, and sports stars, as it imposes strict penalties, including potential imprisonment for offenders. The law encompasses a broad range of protected characteristics, such as race, disability, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Mcilvenna highlighted the case of J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, who has been vocal against certain aspects of the transgender rights movement. Rowling has faced backlash from fellow celebrities and activists but remains steadfast in her beliefs about biological sex and gender. The discussion emphasized the importance of defending free speech under increasingly restrictive legislation. Overall, the conversation underscored the significance of these developments in Scotland and the potential implications for free speech rights in other jurisdictions, including the United States.  Dave Walsh appeared on the WarRoom and criticized the Biden administration’s decision to draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), saying it was a political move aimed at influencing gasoline prices ahead of the upcoming election. Walsh said the administration has not followed through on previous commitments to replenish the SPR when oil prices fell below a certain threshold. He then added that he believes this manipulation of the SPR is ineffective in significantly impacting gasoline prices and is purely politically motivated. Walsh argued that the Department of Energy, responsible for managing the SPR, ultimately reports to the president, making it a decision within his purview.  Mike Howell discussed the significance of Wisconsin becoming the 20th state to ban private funding of election systems, often called the “Zucker Bucks” model. This model, seen in the last presidential election cycle, involved billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg providing funds to staff up and support local election offices in key demographic counties. Howell highlights the new iteration of this model, dubbed “Biden Bucks,” which involves federal government agencies working in collaboration with left-leaning NGOs to mobilize voters. Despite some members of Congress raising concerns, the House of Representatives ultimately funded this initiative, leading to criticism from Howell. Additionally, he mentioned an upcoming symposium addressing various policy areas and featuring notable figures such as FBI whistleblowers, Senator Grassley, and others. #WeapoSympo  In this segment, Mike Lindell discussed two main topics: a Supreme Court case update and news about a recall effort in Wisconsin involving Robin Vos. Regarding the Supreme Court case, Lindell mentioned that lawyers filed additional documents due to the defendants not responding, mainly focusing on issues related to election software manipulation in Arizona. The speaker encourages listeners to visit LindellPlan.com for details. Lindell also highlighted a recall effort against Robin Vos in Wisconsin, urging listeners to check out the new petition at SeenRecall.org. Additionally, Lindell promoted My Pillow’s spring sale, offering various discounts on pillows, towels, sheets, and other products using the promo code “warroom” and mentioning exclusive deals for the War Room Posse. </p>
