<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 12/12/2024 [PM]</h2>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 12, 2024</p>
<p>Mike Davis and Steve Bannon criticized the FBI’s handling of January 6th, focusing on revelations from the Inspector General (IG) report. Davis highlighted concerns over the use of 26 confidential human informants at the Capitol, questioning why some informants were not prosecuted like other January 6th defendants. He called for a fresh investigation into the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) to address alleged weaponization of intelligence agencies. Davis suggested replacing the longstanding DOJ Inspector General with someone new to ensure accountability. He advocated for a special grand jury to investigate “Crossfire Hurricane,” alleging it was part of a broader effort by Democrats to weaponize law enforcement against political opponents. Davis tied this to previous events, including the Mar-a-Lago raid and alleged cover-ups of Hillary Clinton’s foreign dealings. Bannon emphasized the political timing of the IG report’s release, accusing the FBI of strategically dropping it to undermine upcoming reforms by Kash Patel, whom Bannon claimed would bring significant accountability to the FBI. Both speakers encouraged the War Room audience to continue pressuring senators to confirm Patel and support broader judicial reforms. The conversation framed these issues as critical to exposing and dismantling corruption within federal agencies. Davis underscored the importance of public action, citing the War Room Posse’s success in mobilizing thousands of contacts to influence senators. Both maintained optimism about achieving reforms through persistence and public engagement.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly criticized Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s recently released 88-page report on January 6th, dismissing it as inadequate and misleading. Kelly mocked the report’s heavy reliance on filler content, including Attorney General guidelines and already-available transcripts from the January 6th Committee, despite claims of access to 500,000 pages of documentation. Kelly questioned the report’s assertion of 26 FBI confidential human sources (CHS), citing defense attorneys’ skepticism. She argued that without a centralized FBI database or thorough field office inquiries, the figure is unreliable. Kelly also highlighted Horowitz’s dismissal of undercover FBI agents’ involvement, based solely on statements from FBI officials and DOJ policies. She called this approach disingenuous, given ongoing concerns about the FBI’s transparency and tactics. Both Bannon and Kelly agreed the report served as a tool for mainstream media to discredit legitimate questions about FBI informants’ roles in January 6th. They emphasized the need for new DOJ leadership, with Kelly asserting only Donald Trump could fire Horowitz and appoint an inspector general willing to conduct thorough investigations. Bannon and Kelly concluded that the report fails to address key issues, leaving serious questions about FBI involvement and government accountability unanswered.  Darren Beattie and Steve Bannon dissected the revelations from the recent Inspector General (IG) report on January 6th, sharply criticizing the media and FBI for misleading narratives. Beattie began by lambasting mainstream media for their “bait-and-switch” tactics, accusing them of using technicalities to downplay the FBI’s involvement. “The big lie is…none of the [26 confidential human sources] worked for the FBI full-time,” Beattie said, calling this a convenient narrative designed to mislead the public. Beattie highlighted inconsistencies in the FBI’s account, pointing to how confidential informants (CHS) were embedded with militia groups and reported in real-time to their FBI handlers. Despite their involvement, none were prosecuted. “Is it simply statistical chance that not a single CHS was charged with anything, even those who entered the Capitol?” he asked, asserting that this de facto immunity suggested tacit authorization. Steve Bannon built on Beattie’s points, emphasizing the leadership’s complicity. He noted that one FBI informant was the vice president of the Oath Keepers, further evidence of compromised leadership in key militia groups. Both agreed that FBI Director Christopher Wray had lied to Congress and withheld critical information, a failure Bannon described as "disgraceful.” Beattie concluded that these revelations vindicate critics of the January 6th narrative while exposing institutional failures. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Philip Patrick discussed the alarming state of U.S. national debt and economic policy. Patrick highlighted the staggering $624 billion budget deficit in just the first two months of the fiscal year, marking the worst start to a year in U.S. Treasury history. This marks a continuation of a worrying trend, with the U.S. deficit reaching new heights and projections indicating that another trillion dollars will be added in just 100 days. They framed this explosion of debt within the context of the Trump administration’s fiscal policies and the broader global tensions, including proxy wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Bannon stressed the immense impact of this fiscal recklessness, likening it to a “runaway train” and underscored the burden of debt on average Americans, who are facing rising inflation and an economic downturn. He pointed to the mounting debt, now comparable to a “second mortgage” for individuals, as driving inflation and worsening the financial outlook for U.S. families. They also discussed the volatility in financial markets, with Patrick noting that the stock market is now at historic highs, fueled by printed money and unsustainable fiscal policies, which he argued will ultimately lead to a market crash. Both urged listeners to consider precious metals like gold as a hedge against the inevitable economic turbulence.  Natalie WInters talked about her reaction to current events and her recent appearance with Piecre Morgan. Part One:  Part Two:   Steve Bannon criticized the lack of accountability within the U.S. political system, specifically pointing to the Hunter Biden laptop story, where he claimed that no one faced consequences for their actions. He expressed disdain for the absence of a strong value system and the government’s failure to self-investigate. Bannon warned that without intervention, the system would continue its downward spiral, and called for the removal of those in power. He also criticized modern monetary policies, particularly how they contribute to financial instability, arguing that the elite class avoids responsibility for the consequences of economic collapses, such as the 2008 crisis. Bannon believes this has sparked populist movements, which reflect widespread anger and disillusionment with the establishment. He drew comparisons to historical uprisings, warning that the same kind of anger could lead to violent outcomes if ignored. Bannon further emphasized the disconnect between the elites and the common people, pointing out that despite the promises of hope and change from Obama, the financial and social systems remain broken. He argued that the political elite, particularly those in neoliberal and neoconservative circles, have consistently failed to address the real issues facing ordinary Americans. Bannon also touched on the upcoming 2024 election, stating that the "anti-system” players were on the rise, predicting that the fight would not focus on issues like abortion but rather on the survival of the system itself. </p>
