<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/3/2024 [AM] DAY OF ACTION</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 3, 2024</p>
<p>Steve Bannon hosted the Wednesday morning WarRoom program. Today is a day of action, and the audience needs to note Charlie Kirk’s remarks below for instructions. The goal is to call and encourage Nebraska to change its state laws. Keep reading for instructions. Highlights: The Wednesday morning WarRoom program, hosted by Steve Bannon, highlighted various political, legal, and grassroots efforts to support former President Trump and criticize opponents within both the Republican Party and Democratic parites. Charlie Kirk urged Republicans to repeal Nebraska’s 1991 law, which assigns two electors to the state’s winner and one for each congressional district. The goal is to shift Nebraska to a winner-take-all system, potentially benefiting Trump’s chances in future elections. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen and Trump endorsed this initiative. Doug Mackey‘s case, where he was arrested for posting memes on Twitter and charged with conspiracy against civil rights, was discussed, raising concerns about freedom of speech. Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock discussed the growing problem of squatting and title theft, emphasizing the importance of homeowners safeguarding their properties and equity. Darren Beattie criticized the Biden DOJ’s attempt to suppress speech deemed as “disinformation” and discussed Mackey’s case as emblematic of broader trends targeting Trump supporters. Mike Lindell expressed gratitude for support in Wisconsin and promoted his product line, including special deals on pillows and other items. Dave Brat and Bannon discussed Jim Wallace’s gospel interpretation, highlighting skepticism about his approach and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing biblical teachings in education. Overall, the program aimed to raise awareness and encourage action on various political and legal issues while promoting unity among supporters. Each segment below provides insights into various issues and encourages audience engagement and awareness. Recommended Reading: Gospel of Mark (Bannon reads King James version) Darren Beattie’s letter to Elon Musk about Clinton crushing Meme case Recommended Watching: Elmer Gentry- the movie Bannon uses at the end of the cold open Crucial implements all Posse members need to have: Tool for Charlie Kirk’s Call for Action- BillBlaster Day of Action details:  Donald Trump and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen have endorsed legislation that aims to change the allocation of electoral votes in Nebraska, potentially removing Omaha’s pivotal electoral vote from consideration for Democrats. Conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republicans to repeal the state’s 1991 law, which assigns two electors to the state’s winner and one for each congressional district. Despite Republicans consistently winning Nebraska, the Omaha-based 2nd District voted Democratic in 2008 and 2020. Kirk called on Nebraskans to demand their state stop giving strength to their political opponents. Five hours after Kirk’s post on Tuesday, Pillen expressed support for a bill shifting Nebraska to a winner-take-all system. Trump also endorsed Pillen’s move, acknowledging the district’s significance in potentially deciding close races between Trump and President Biden. The attention on Omaha’s district underscores its potential role as a tiebreaker in presidential elections. Full show in segments: Steve Bannon opened the Wed WarRoom with clips from MSNBC showing the talking heads being highly emotional and highly charged about President Donald Trump’s surging popularity with key demographics Democrats rely on to win the presidency in 2024. Bannon highlighted the intense media coverage surrounding the upcoming election, particularly on MSNBC. The coverage focused on Trump’s actions at political rallies, and Bannon mentioned polling data indicating Trump’s strength in battleground states. He then critiques the Biden administration’s handling of various issues, including economics and immigration. Bannon deconstructed the strategy by Trump’s opponents to portray him negatively as an authoritarian figure while positioning themselves as defenders of true Christianity. This segment portrays a highly charged political atmosphere with strong rhetoric and strategic maneuvering that Bannon is known best for delivering to the WarRoom audience.  Bannon reflected on the Democrat’s political strategy and messaging in the context of the 2024 election. He emphasized the importance of knowing who to persuade and who to defeat in campaigns, mainly focusing on issues like abortion and the right-to-life movement. In this segment, he discusses the tactics of Trump’s opponents, including the Democrat’s attempts to portray him negatively, using stale political messaging, that he is an authoritarian figure, and working to divide voters along racial lines. Bannon said that he supports  Trump’s team countering these narratives and promoting Christian values with a turn of the phrase for “Transgender Day of Visibility,” like Trump did calling for a Christian Day of Visibility on election day at a recent campaign event. Bannon went into great detail, highlighting the significance of the Gospel of Mark in the Holy Bible, and contrasted that with the Democrat’s idea of Biblical teachings. Bannon critiqued specific interpretations of Christianity, which were discussed on MSNBC, in order to marginalize supporters of Trump, who MSNBC speakers say push a false “white gospel” that they want to be replaced with what Bannon calls a social justice warrior ideology. Bannon discussed his interpretation of Christianity and explained how that relates to his political views.  The conversation highlights the case of Doug Mackey, who was arrested for posting memes on Twitter and charged with conspiracy against civil rights. The case is foundational and historic. Mackey was charged to 7 months and $50,000 dollar fine. There is an appeal hearing on Friday. Bannon jumped into the legal implications of Mackey’s case, highlighting concerns about freedom of speech and the potential misuse of legal statutes to suppress political dissent. Bannon expressed skepticism about the charges against Mackey and criticized what he perceived as an overreach by law enforcement and the judicial system. Bannon argued that Mackey’s case for posting memes in 2016 is part of a broader trend of targeting supporters of President Trump who express views contrary to those of the ruling elites, particularly within the Biden administration and ahead of the 2024 election is chilling. The conversation underscores the importance of defending free speech rights and resisting efforts to criminalize political speech. Mackey directed people to MemeDefense.com to learn more about his situation.  Natalie Dominguez, a theft specialist at Home Title Lock, discussed the growing problem of squatting and title theft, particularly in light of recent viral videos encouraging illegal immigrants to occupy unoccupied homes. Squatting involves gaining access to a property without the owner’s permission and exploiting legal loopholes to remain there. It can lead to adverse possession laws granting squatters legal ownership over time. According to Dominquez, squatters increasingly resort to fraudulent documentation and lease agreements to prolong their stay and complicate eviction procedures for homeowners. On the other hand, title theft involves fraudulently transferring ownership of a property and exploiting its equity through lines of credit or unauthorized sales. Dominguez told Bannon that Home Title Lock offers triple lock protection against title theft, including 24/7 monitoring, title change alerts, and expert assistance. She emphasized the importance of homeowners being vigilant and taking proactive measures to safeguard their properties and equity. She encouraged homeowners to visit hometitlelock.com and use the promo code “war room” to receive 30 days of free protection and a free title scan.  Darren Beattie, editor of Revolver News, appeared on the WarRoom to talk to Steve Bannon about the growing fear and frustration over the lawfare of Trump supporters for posting memes and engaging in political speech. Beattie criticized the Biden Department of Justice (DOJ) for attempting to codify the suppression of speech they deem as “disinformation” into the legal framework. Beattie argues that this is a form of lawfare where the legal system is weaponized to silence political opponents. Bannon and Beattie highlight the case of Doug Mackey, who was arrested and convicted for posting memes on Twitter, as emblematic of this broader trend. Beattie told Bannon that he sees Mackey’s case as a test balloon for whether the government can imprison individuals for expressing opinions contrary to those in power. Beattie also criticized the collaboration of social media platforms like Twitter in Mackey’s prosecution, suggesting that they provided information to authorities that led to his arrest, which is the foundation for his article and letter to Elon Musk to remedy his part of the problem. Beattie calls for support for Mackey’s case and urges people to visit revolver.news for more information and to share the case details.  Charlie Kirk discussed a grassroots effort in Nebraska to change the allocation of electoral votes. The effort aims to move away from what they have- and to become a winner-takes-all system instead of one that distributes electoral votes based on congressional districts. This change could potentially give Donald Trump a better chance of winning the presidency. Kirk emphasized the importance of this effort and encouraged people to contact Senator Rita Sanders and Senator Raymond Aguilar, two specific state senators, to express support for the bill. He highlights Governor Pete Ricketts’ endorsement of the bill and President Trump’s backing of the initiative. Kirk stresses the need for respectful communication with the senators and urges individuals, particularly those from Nebraska, to advocate for the bill’s passage. He plans to visit Nebraska to support the initiative in person. Kirk sees this effort as crucial for potentially changing the electoral map and increasing Trump’s chances of winning the presidency in future elections. See notes above for more information:   Mike Lindell expressed gratitude to the War Room Posse, attributing their efforts to the success in Wisconsin this week. He then discussed his product line, including the rolling pillows available at a special price of two for $25. Lindell highlighted various designs that were available and encouraged listeners to visit the website to make a purchase. Additionally, Lindell mentioned discounts on other products, such as sandals, slides, premium pillows, and a four-pack dish towel set, all available for $25 each. Lindell concluded by expressing love for the War Room Posse and encouraging them to call in with their support.  The conversation between Dave Brat and Steve Bannon touched on Jim Wallace’s interpretation of the gospel from his new book, which some see as centered around social justice Jesus rather than the traditional teachings found in the Bible. Brat expressed skepticism about Wallace’s approach, noting that the Bible does not support a “white gospel” narrative and highlighted figures like Saint Augustine, who was not white but contributed significantly to Christian theology. The discussion also touches on the separation of church and state, referencing recent events like Joe Biden’s acknowledgment of Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter. Despite ideological differences, as Brat noted, the Democrats on MSNBC now shared belief in God’s sovereignty and the importance of traditional family values across Abrahamic faiths—which he argued should lead to a discussion of when Bibles go back into the American classrooms. Overall, Brat emphasized the need to prioritize Biblical teachings, reintroduce them into education, and focus on foundational principles like the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman. The conversation ends with a sense of optimism about the potential for unity and positive change- wich may or may not have been laced with a touch of witty, Brat, sarcasm. Listen, and you decide.  </p>
