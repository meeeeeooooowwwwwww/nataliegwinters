<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/1/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> July 2, 2024</p>
<p>In a conversation between Dave Brat and Darren Beattie, they discussed the current tactics of the left in silencing opposition. Beattie argued that traditional methods like labeling opponents as racists or conspiracy theorists are less effective due to declining trust in the media. Consequently, the left has resorted to imprisoning political opponents, mentioning figures like Peter Navarro and Doug Mackey. Beattie suggested that such actions reflect the regime’s desperation and have backfired, strengthening public support for patriotism. Brat highlighted recent shifts in media messaging, particularly noting the New York Times’ inconsistent stance and the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party. Beattie elaborated on the complexities of replacing Biden, emphasizing that despite media hostility, influential Democrats are unlikely to oust him due to intertwined career interests and the risks involved. They concluded that Biden is likely to remain in place, but the Democrats face significant challenges. The discussion underscored the dynamic between media narratives and political strategy, with Brat and Beattie predicting continued turmoil within the Democratic ranks and the importance of alternative media like the War Room in providing accurate information.  In a conversation between Dave Brat and Jeff Clark on the War Room, Jeff Clark reacted to a clip featuring Bill Barr laughing about Steve Bannon being sent to prison. Clark expressed disappointment at Barr’s reaction, emphasizing the gravity of a former attorney general showing delight at someone’s imprisonment, especially a former top advisor to the president. He discussed the Supreme Court’s recent decision on presidential immunity, noting the mainstream media’s meltdown over the ruling and explaining that the decision reinforces the president’s authority to investigate and prosecute under the Constitution. Clark highlighted the ruling’s implications for the Deep State, arguing that it disrupts the established system where career officials, predominantly Democrats, controlled these decisions. He noted that the president now has reaffirmed control over such matters, causing significant concern among those officials. Dave Brat asked Clark about the media’s potential reactions and the significance of the ruling. Clark dismissed the media’s comparisons to extreme hypotheticals, emphasizing that the ruling aligns with the original constitutional framework and does not introduce new laws. He asserted that this ruling marks a return to the principles of the Constitution, challenging the post-constitutional era that began during the Progressive Era and intensified after Nixon. Clark further elaborated on the Supreme Court’s clarification of presidential immunity, explaining that official acts, such as the president’s speech on January 6th, should be protected. He argued that President Trump’s speech that day, urging people to peacefully and patriotically express their views, was an official act deserving of immunity. In conclusion, Clark encouraged listeners to support actions upholding the Constitution, such as calling on Congress to void the January 6th Committee’s subpoenas, including those leading to Bannon’s imprisonment.  In a conversation on the War Room, Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Polling discussed recent polling data with Dave Brat. The focus was on the aftermath of a debate and its impact on Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s standings. Mitchell noted a significant public concern about the country’s stability, with 41% of people fearing a potential civil war. Mitchell highlighted key recent events, such as a guilty verdict and a poor debate performance by Biden, which affected his approval ratings. Two months ago, Biden’s approval was 40%, with Trump leading him by 10 points. After the debate and other events, Biden’s approval briefly rose to 45%, reducing Trump’s lead to 5 points. However, Trump has since regained his lead, now at plus nine in head-to-head matchups. In their latest polling, Trump led Biden by 9 points, with 49% support for Trump and 40% for Biden. In a multi-way matchup, Trump’s lead increased to 10 points. Mitchell reported that 70% of voters watched most or all of the debate, with 56% declaring Trump the winner compared to 21% for Biden. Among Democrats, only 46% believed Biden won, and 24% thought Trump did. Post-debate, Biden’s approval among independents dropped to 34%, with overall approval falling to 28%, the lowest in two months. Mitchell concluded that the Democrats have returned to the difficult situation they faced in May, and Biden’s approval might dip further. He suggested that the Trump campaign should focus on winning down-ballot races, as inflation and the economy remain top concerns for voters.  Maureen Bannon, in her comments, emphasizes the importance of spreading the message of the “War Room” show and its content. She urges viewers to encourage their friends to watch the show and to open their eyes to the information being shared. She also mentions that despite her father, Steve Bannon, being in prison, his voice will still be heard through the show and its platforms. The message is clear: the “War Room” and its mission will not be silenced, and the show will continue to be a platform for sharing information and ideas.  Founder of Moms for Liberty, Tiffany Justice, talked to Natalie Winters about the schedule of events they have over the summer for people to get involved with their activism to support and defend parent rights and various campaigns.  In a discussion on War Room, Ben Harnwell highlighted Steve Bannon’s deep understanding of the system from his time in the Navy, the Pentagon, and Goldman Sachs, noting that Bannon’s insights have equipped the MAGA movement to fight against the very institutions where he first found success. Harnwell described Bannon as a “class traitor” not to the Republic or America but to establishments like Goldman Sachs and the military-industrial complex. He also discussed the significant political shift in France, where the National Rally saw increased support following the European elections, despite President Macron’s strategy to label them as far-right and present an ultimatum to voters. Harnwell emphasized the National Rally’s strict stance on immigration, distinguishing them from traditional elites and preventing them from being labeled far-left, despite their socialist and protectionist policies. He underscored that the elites are determined to bring in as many people from the third world into the West as possible, viewing this as an existential issue that only the people can stop.
