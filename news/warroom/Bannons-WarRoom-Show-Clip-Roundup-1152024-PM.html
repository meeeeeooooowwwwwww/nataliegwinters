<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/5/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> November 6, 2024</p>
<p>In a conversation about election dynamics, Steve Bannon, Natalie Winters, and Jack Posobiec analyze anticipated voter behavior and the mainstream media’s framing of a potential “red mirage.” Winters criticizes the media’s narrative as an attempt to preemptively undermine Republican wins by blaming delayed ballot counts. She highlights that changes in election laws will likely reduce delays in key states, potentially preventing scenarios like those seen in 2020. Posobiec emphasizes high turnout among working-class, rural voters in Pennsylvania, particularly men, describing this as a “populist uprising.” He notes sparse turnout in urban Democratic strongholds, contrasting with strong GOP participation in rural areas. The group also discusses Project 65, a legal group targeting Trump-aligned lawyers, and points out that government agencies are closely monitoring polling in swing states. They argue that these actions reveal the Democrats’ “lawfare” tactics, suggesting attempts to undermine GOP voting efforts. Bannon and Posobiec wrap up by expressing disdain for Democratic leaders and highlighting their platform as a counter to media narratives, emphasizing a populist, anti-establishment movement in the run-up to the 2024 election.  In a discussion with Steve Bannon, Cliff Maloney emphasized a robust Republican effort in Pennsylvania, detailing a field campaign with 120 workers aiming to reach 500,000 doors by election night. Maloney expressed confidence in the Republican ground game and mail-in vote strategy, reporting that Republicans are closing the gap in areas traditionally dominated by Democratic mail-in ballots. He argued that Democrats are failing to mobilize the same level of turnout as 2020, potentially weakening their strongholds. Bannon and other speakers noted shifting voter sentiments, particularly among African American men in Philadelphia, indicating a growing dissatisfaction with Democratic policies. While Democratic strategists like Jonathan Martin highlighted an impressive ground game in Pennsylvania, Bannon countered that Republicans’ targeted efforts are paying off. Both Bannon and Maloney underscored the importance of turnout, especially from first-time and low-propensity voters, to secure a victory in Pennsylvania.  In this discussion, Ben Bergquam and Jordan Conradson report on two key issues from Maricopa County on election day. First, Bergquam reveals a leaked ICE memo directing agents in Arizona and Pennsylvania not to wear uniforms or badges when voting, citing concerns that it might deter or “spook” non-citizens present at polling sites. Bannon criticizes this directive as disrespectful to ICE agents, viewing it as an unnecessary accommodation for illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Conradson describes extensive wait times at Arizona polling locations, noting that Maricopa County’s lengthy four-page ballot takes voters around 30 minutes to complete, contrary to the county’s estimated 10–12 minutes. This is causing long lines, raising concerns of delays similar to those seen in 2022. Despite these challenges, Republicans report an early lead over Democrats in Arizona, though turnout remains crucial.  Steve Bannon and Lara Trump expressed confidence in the Republican voter turnout for Election Day, highlighting significant early voting and long lines in key battleground states. She noted efforts to address voting issues, including poll watcher access and machine problems. Lara emphasized the GOP’s targeted strategy of mobilizing low-propensity voters, which particularly benefits Trump. She also reported a decrease in urban turnout alongside increased rural participation, which she believes favors Republicans. Bannon discussed minority voting patterns, with Lara citing high polling support for Trump among African-American, Hispanic, and Arab-American voters. Lara remained optimistic about North Carolina staying red, citing effective local voter outreach. She encouraged Republicans to stay informed via social media updates on any voting issues, aiming to boost confidence and encourage turnout.  Sam Faddis, discussing Pennsylvania’s voter turnout with Steve Bannon, emphasized an unprecedented level of in-person voting participation, suggesting that early mail-in voting had not detracted from Election Day turnout. Reporting from his precinct and various regions statewide, Faddis described exceptionally high voter engagement, with lines and wait times, such as two-hour waits in places like Hamburg near Allentown. Areas like Bradford and Northumberland Counties, as well as Erie, reported record turnout. Faddis highlighted that these numbers surpassed anything previously seen in Pennsylvania, indicating strong overall participation. He directed listeners to follow updates via AND Magazine’s Substack and his social media.  In this discussion, Steve Bannon and Kash Patel analyzed current polling data and turnout in key states. They noted that Trump, in 2020, was down by an average of 8.4 points at this stage, while in this cycle, he trails by only one point. Patel emphasized Nevada’s turnout, highlighting high voter participation in Las Vegas’ Clark County, where Republicans now lead by 45,000 votes compared to trailing by 145,000 in 2020. He urged voters in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin to get to the polls, believing that Trump has the numbers to win if supporters turn out. The conversation also touched on reports from Philadelphia and Arizona, where Bannon described “machine state” tactics, mentioning Democratic operatives and long voting lines in urban areas. Patel and Bannon expressed concern about an email directing ICE agents in Arizona and Pennsylvania not to wear uniforms or badges while voting, speculating this might be intended to avoid intimidating non-citizens at the polls. They found this directive troubling, seeing it as a slight against ICE agents.  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse discuss strategies and emerging data regarding Republican voter turnout and potential victories in key regions during an election. DeGrasse emphasizes Republican gains in Guam and early indicators of strong GOP performance in places like Florida and New York, where Republicans reportedly lead Democrats by significant margins in voter turnout. He also highlights New Hampshire’s unexpectedly high turnout and close races, signaling competitive dynamics. The two also discuss the importance of New York congressional seats, which could block Democrat Hakeem Jeffries from gaining a majority in the House. Bannon and DeGrasse urge Republican voters to remain calm and patient, particularly in high-turnout areas, to counteract any potential delays or challenges. DeGrasse mentions the deployment of election integrity teams and lawyers to oversee potential issues and encourages voters to document irregularities. The goal, they emphasize, is a smooth and legally solid process to ensure Republican victories and certify results swiftly. Both assert that these proactive efforts are crucial for the GOP’s path to control in the House. </p>
