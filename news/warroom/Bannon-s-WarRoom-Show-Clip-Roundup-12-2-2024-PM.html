<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 12/2/2024 [PM]</h2>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> December 3, 2024</p>
<p>Steve Bannon talks about the announcement that Joe Biden will pardon his son, Hunter, and his belief that Hunter would not last in any federal prison.  Natalie Winters talked about the pardon for Hunter Biden.  Natalie Winters talked about the corruption with the family of Democrat Joe Biden.  Dr. Malone criticizes the ongoing bird flu scare, calling it another round of fear-mongering with little evidence to support concerns. He points out that previous cases of bird flu, such as those in Canada and California, have not led to significant health issues or human-to-human transmission. He dismisses this as psychological bioterrorism, meant to stir panic. Dr. Malone shifts focus to a recent House report on COVID-19, which he claims provides conclusive evidence that the pandemic originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and that the World Health Organization (WHO) withheld crucial information to protect the Chinese Communist Party. He also highlights the report’s criticism of lockdowns, quarantines, and vaccines, labeling them as failures. Malone calls for WHO Director-General Tedros to resign, asserting that Trump’s team should approach global health institutions cautiously, possibly withdrawing from the WHO and reconsidering involvement in organizations like the World Economic Forum. He further criticizes the NIH, especially under former leaders like Fauci, for its role in the pandemic response and its overall dysfunction. He recommends significant budget cuts and a complete overhaul to ensure the NIH serves the American people effectively. Malone believes that Trump should focus on dismantling problematic agencies and prioritizing national interests over globalist agendas.  Mike Benz talked about his investigations into corruption in Ukraine.  Julie Kelly joined Steve Bannon in the War Room to discuss what she sees as the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) weaponization against the defendants on January 6th, contrasting it with the leniency shown toward Hunter Biden. Bannon opened the discussion by framing January 20, 2025, as "Accountability Day,” emphasizing the need for justice for those he described as political prisoners. Kelly detailed how recent DOJ actions have ramped up against January 6th participants, even four years after the event, alleging that federal authorities are targeting individuals to weaken the “patriot movement.” She described these efforts as punitive and vengeful, with defendants facing harsh penalties, excessive pretrial detentions, and what she called "torture-like conditions.” The conversation shifted to Hunter Biden’s recent plea agreement and the leniency he has been afforded despite allegations of serious crimes committed while his father was in office. Kelly argued that Biden’s pardon groundwork opens the door for similar clemency for defendants on January 6th, highlighting the disparity in how the justice system has handled the two cases. "This isn’t about enforcing the law equally,” Kelly said. "It’s about punishing political dissent.” She called for a comprehensive review and potential pardons for those prosecuted for January 6th, asserting that the DOJ’s actions have been politically motivated and destructive to the justice system’s credibility.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly engaged in a detailed critique of key individuals and institutions they allege are responsible for politically motivated prosecutions following January 6. The discussion highlighted figures such as Attorney General Merrick Garland, Deputy AG Lisa Monaco, and U.S. Attorney for D.C., Matthew Graves, accusing them of weaponizing legal proceedings against Donald Trump and his supporters. Graves was singled out as a central figure in pursuing harsh sentences, including those for “seditious conspiracy” and obstruction charges, which Kelly argued were politically driven and unprecedented for non-violent offenders. They examined Graves’ connections, notably his ties to the Biden administration and his wife’s involvement in left-wing activism, claiming systemic bias. The conversation also addressed judges overseeing January 6 cases, emphasizing Judge Amit Mehta and others who allowed stringent charges and excessive sentences, suggesting a broader judicial alignment with the prosecution’s agenda. Bannon and Kelly linked these actions to a strategy aimed at discrediting Trump and MAGA supporters. The conversation concluded with a vow to expose these individuals publicly and hold them accountable post-2025. Bannon warned law firms against hiring Graves, pledging to organize protests and campaigns against such moves. The dialogue framed the ongoing prosecutions as a violation of constitutional rights, likening them to authoritarian show trials, while emphasizing Trump’s potential to overturn these actions upon reelection. Kelly’s investigative work on these cases was also promoted as a resource for uncovering perceived injustices. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Part Four:   In this conversation between Steve Bannon and Sheriff Mack, they discussed strategies for addressing illegal immigration and the role of Constitutional sheriffs in implementing humane deportation policies. Sheriff Mack emphasized that while the military could assist at the border, sheriffs are uniquely positioned to identify and address immigration issues locally. He highlighted the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of relying on sheriffs’ localized knowledge rather than complex federal operations. Sheriff Mack criticized the Biden administration’s border policies and sanctuary city practices, calling for accountability and prosecution of officials aiding illegal immigration. He praised President Trump’s courage and forward planning, expressing support for a Constitutional approach to law enforcement and immigration reform. Mack also warned against poor administrative appointments, such as a Florida sheriff he deemed unqualified for a federal role, urging Trump to prioritize experienced Constitutional sheriffs. Bannon and Mack agreed on the importance of coordinated efforts, with sheriffs playing a central role in ensuring community safety and effective immigration control. Bannon highlighted Trump’s bold economic and trade policies as complementary to border security, emphasizing tariffs as leverage to influence foreign governments’ actions on immigration and drug trafficking.
