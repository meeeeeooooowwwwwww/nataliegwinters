00 doors,” Mahoney said, confident in their progress. He stressed the importance of fixing the mail-in voting system to win the state, noting that current ballot request numbers favor Republicans. Mahoney described a recent rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as a high-energy event: "The energy in the room…you just don’t see that in the political world.” He believes this election will determine the future of the Republic, asserting, "This is the election that will decide the future.” Comparing mail-in ballot requests to 2020, Mahoney pointed out that Democrats are down 400,000 requests, while Republicans are only down 87,000. He said, "We only lost this state by 80,000 votes,” highlighting the momentum shift. Mahoney expressed optimism about voter enthusiasm, especially among groups traditionally supportive of Democrats, and warned that if Democrats lose, their national viability could be in jeopardy. He encouraged continued efforts to secure victory through targeted voter outreach and ballot chasing, adding that the groundwork laid now is critical to winning Pennsylvania.  Matthew Tragesser highlighted the significant impact of migration policies on Pittsburgh and its suburbs, specifically focusing on the town of Charleroi. He noted that Charleroi has experienced a 2,000% increase in its migrant population over the past two years, a striking statistic considering the town only has around 4,000 residents. According to Tragesser, this surge is causing substantial strain on local resources, including education and public services. Taxpayers are now shouldering an additional financial burden, paying "hundreds of thousands of dollars extra” to accommodate the growing demand for social services and public schools. Tragesser also raised concerns about increased crime and pressure on medical facilities, particularly emergency services, describing the situation as unsustainable for Western Pennsylvania. He linked these local issues to broader national challenges, noting that Pennsylvania’s experience is reflective of what is happening in regions across the country. Tragesser concluded by encouraging viewers to read more about the topic on Fox News and follow his updates on Twitter, where he continues to cover the evolving situation in Pennsylvania and beyond.

Natalie Winters talked about Mark Zuckerberg’s 2020 Get Out the Vote efforts and how the corporate media discussed his operations, which are very different from how they discuss voter engagement and get-out-the-vote efforts from Republicans- especially how they are reporting Elon Musk’s support for President Trump.  Phillip Patrick discussed the rising cost of living under Joe Biden and the truth about the employment rates being lower than has been reported. Patrick also discussed Bidenonomics and inflation.  Citizen Kane discussed the latest posts, polling, and voter registrations and how they are connected, and they also discussed Kamala Harris’s appearance on The View.  Alex DeGrasse talked about people having a list of 10 people who they believe they can influence and get them to vote.  Alex DeGrasse reminded the audience that turnout is the key, adding that young people are turning toward Trump in large numbers, but they often do not show up to vote.  DeGrasse encouraged people to focus on getting young people out to vote.  Grace Chong talked about signing up for the WarRoom newsletter for JoJo’s articles, which will have links on where to go for grassroots and how to get involved with the election. Those articles, she said, are expected to be posted soon and she encouraged people to pass them around by email once they got the articles.  Chong added that people should be following her social media on X for Steve’s older clips, his general messaging, and inspiration. She also talked about the numerous voter apps that she wants people to engage with, making sure to tell people to vote for Republicans so we can hold the House and get the Senate, adding that turnout is essential. Hence, we need to be optimistic about the election and Republican candidates. Chong said that people should email any questions to JoJo, who will give everyone the “White Glove Treatment to help them get engaged in their local area or with groups she knows about,” adding that since she and JoJo started this email campaign a couple of days ago, there has been a “flood of emails,” noting that there is a lot of excitement and questions from the Possee.

Natalie Winters talks about what she calls the Deep State and their weaponization of government tactics.  Mike Davis talked about his experience working on the US Supreme Court nomination process, specifically during the time of Brett Kavanagh. He pointed out that a recent investigation into Kavanagh, based on Sheldon Whitehouse, is the corporate media spreading misinformation and using lawfare tactics against Kavanagh.  Davis reminds the WarRoom audience that at the time of Kvanagh’s nomination, Davis released a list of things that the Senate could have investigated with Senate investigators and chose not to follow up on.  Liz Harrington told us about the latest developments in Georgia regarding the 2020 election and how fraud and corruption were detected there.   Patty McMurray talked about the importance of a lawsuit aimed at halting the counting of overseas ballots in Michigan, where voters do not have to prove residency or citizenship. She explains that the Michigan GOP and RNC filed this lawsuit against Michigan Secretary of State Jasmine Benson and her Director of Elections, Jonathan Breeder, for giving clerks guidance that allows overseas voters, registered under the UOCAVA designation, to vote without proving they lived in Michigan or the U.S. Some overseas voters, Patty claims, may never have resided in Michigan or the U.S., and yet ballots are distributed to them via email. She notes a significant increase in overseas ballots in 2020, which is not widely reported except by The Gateway Pundit, and expresses frustration over the situation.  Natalie Winters talked about a recent interview of Kamala Harris.  Sam Faddis reviewed Vice President candidate Tim Walz’s numerous connections with the Chinese Communist Party.  Grace Chong revised the final dates for registering to vote. She promoted JoJo’s position of answering questions by email regarding getting out the vote for the Trump campaign. Chong said that JoJo had reported getting many emails asking how to get active for the second day.  In a discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and Capt. Jim Fanell, they address increasing threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Indo-Pacific region under the Biden administration. Col. Fanell highlights key points such as China’s intercontinental ballistic missile test, its aggressive military activities, and its expanding naval presence. These actions, including incursions near Taiwan, Japan, and the Philippines, indicate China’s growing ambition to displace U.S. influence and dominate the region. He also points out strategic losses like the potential turnover of Diego Garcia, which compromises U.S. security. Fanell underscores that these developments significantly degraded national security compared to the Trump era, where the Indo-Pacific was more stable. He emphasizes that China is practicing to strike the U.S. with nuclear weapons and notes their increasing aggression toward Taiwan, Japan, and other U.S. allies. The conversation also touches on the geopolitical importance of Taiwan, especially in the context of chip production and political symbolism. They conclude that China’s actions, including military provocations and political warfare, are part of a broader strategy that is likely to intensify before the U.S. elections, reflecting the CCP’s desire to influence global politics.

Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon laid out a detailed plan for Donald Trump’s potential second term, emphasizing a swift and strategic staffing of key government roles to dismantle the "Deep State.” They criticized open borders, anti-tariff policies, and entrenched politicians who obstructed Trump’s first term. Bannon and Navarro suggested that Trump could use a Senate recess within his first 30 days to make numerous appointments, circumventing bureaucratic delays. They called for an open Senate vote on November 13 to confirm support for Trump-friendly Senate leadership, ensuring cooperation with this plan. Navarro highlighted his article in The Washington Times as a blueprint for Trump’s early-term strategy, which he claimed would allow Trump to make sweeping changes in immigration, energy, and trade policies. Navarro and Bannon urged supporters to demand transparency and accountability from their Senators, framing this as crucial for advancing Trump’s vision. By quickly appointing allies and implementing bold policy reforms, they argue, Trump could counter opposition from establishment Republicans and ensure loyalty within the government.  In this conversation, conservative attorney Mike Davis discusses his call for intense legal scrutiny of figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Special Counsel Jack Smith, who have pursued cases against former President Donald Trump and his allies. Davis expresses a strong desire to hold these figures accountable, suggesting they should undergo rigorous investigations by various government committees and agencies. He asserts that, if they’ve acted lawfully, they should have nothing to fear from such probes. Davis positions his stance as a response to what he sees as political bias and interference by these officials in Trump-related cases, suggesting that their actions represent a coordinated effort by the Biden administration against Trump. Davis also addresses broader issues regarding Senate obstruction during Trump’s term, criticizing Republican senators for not pushing through Trump’s judicial and executive appointments more aggressively. He supports the idea of using recess appointments if necessary, particularly if Democrats attempt to obstruct Trump’s agenda in a potential second term. He notes that forcing Senate members to stay in session rather than allowing long weekends could expedite confirmations.  Steve Bannon talks about President Trump’s cabinet choices so far.   Eric Prince and Steve Bannon engage in a candid discussion on U.S. foreign policy, military spending, and the importance of private sector innovation in government operations. Prince starts by describing his current mission to brief new Republican senators about the global geopolitical situation, emphasizing the need to reduce U.S. military involvement abroad and rely more on private contractors rather than expanding the defense budget. He reflects on the failures of U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, suggesting a leaner, contractor-based approach could have saved resources while stabilizing the country. He criticizes the U.S. military-industrial complex, highlighting the inefficiencies and the high costs of current operations. Drawing on historical examples, he advocates for using contractors to maintain global order at a fraction of the cost of traditional military interventions. Prince also stresses the importance of price discovery and cost transparency in defense spending, citing economist Hayek’s argument that a lack of pricing information leads to inefficient resource allocation. He questions the effectiveness of military strategies, like the U.S. Navy’s current operations in the Red Sea, and stresses the need to rethink traditional approaches to global military presence. The conversation then shifts to the political realm, with Prince offering advice to President Trump’s potential transition team. He underscores the importance of granting recess appointments to bypass bureaucratic delays in staffing the government. He also praises private sector innovation, drawing parallels with Elon Musk’s achievements in space travel, and urges the government to adopt a similar approach to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Bannon expresses support for Prince’s perspective and the importance of streamlining government operations. He mentions a recent political firestorm in the Senate, where some MAGA-aligned senators were voting in ways that didn’t align with their constituents’ expectations. Bannon highlights the need for transparency and public accountability, particularly with regard to Senate leadership votes, and hints at revealing who voted for whom, in line with his broader push for openness and MAGA’s influence in Washington. Part One :  Part Two:  Julie Kelly and Steve Bannon discuss ongoing political issues surrounding the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, and the prosecution of individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Kelly highlights growing support on Capitol Hill for investigating the misconduct of special counsel Jack Smith and his team, particularly regarding the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago. She emphasizes the emotional toll the raid had on Melania Trump and calls for a special counsel to investigate it further. Kelly also criticizes the DOJ for its treatment of January 6th defendants, accusing Washington DC judges of bias and mishandling cases. She expresses outrage at the political motivations behind these prosecutions, linking them to broader efforts to punish Trump supporters. Bannon supports Kelly’s views, particularly regarding the need to dismantle the FBI and investigate those responsible for weaponizing the justice system against Trump allies. Both emphasize the need for retribution against those involved in the persecution of January 6th protesters and individuals like Peter Navarro. Kelly also calls for the public to demand accountability, particularly from Republican senators like John Cornyn, whom she accuses of supporting authoritarian tactics. The conversation underscores their belief that revenge and retribution are necessary for the victims of political persecution.  Natalie Winters talked about the most recent battle for the WarRoom over Senate Republicans and the push for transparency about their leadership vote.  Jeff Clark and Steve Bannon discuss the challenges facing conservative leadership within government institutions, emphasizing the deep state’s resistance to strong Republican leadership. Clark points out that much of the career civil service, particularly at the Department of Justice (DOJ), is predominantly Democrat, making it difficult for Republican presidents to implement their agendas. He highlights the importance of having strong, competent individuals in key legal positions to ensure the integrity of the DOJ. Clark also criticizes the weaponization of the National Security Division under the Biden Administration, which he believes has shifted focus from foreign terrorism to targeting domestic political opponents, including conservatives, which he views as unconstitutional and anti-American. Bannon echoes these sentiments, stressing the need for accountability rather than revenge. He critiques the mainstream narrative of unity pushed by the left, arguing that it often seeks to disarm conservatives while failing to hold their own side accountable. Both Clark and Bannon believe that the government has overreached in its efforts to suppress conservative views, citing examples like the FBI’s involvement in monitoring school board meetings. In a broader political context, Clark discusses President Trump’s push for recess appointments, arguing that Senate maneuvers to block such appointments contradict the constitutional framework. He supports Trump’s efforts to assert his mandate and governance powers. Both men emphasize the importance of returning to a constitutional government, with Clark encouraging people to follow his work at the Center for Renewing America.

Natalie Winters talked about an Atlanta article that now condones the idea of a Deep State cling. It protects important career bureaucrats.  Natalie Winters exposes Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was found in contempt of Congress but not required to be punished for his hypocrisy toward Steve Bannon and demanding he be imprisoned.  Phillip Patrick outlined the problems with Bidenonmcs and the issues President Trump faces in his new administration.  Mike Benz talks about the censorship tactics he believes will be used to target supporters of President Trump.  Natalie Winters uses humor to address the very large number of supposed Democratic voters who Supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election but did not vote in the 2024 election.  Steve Bannon reacted with satisfaction to a video of Democratic strategist James Carville expressing anger at the Democratic Party’s losses, saying Carville’s frustrations highlighted the party’s failure to address issues like public safety and an "identity disaster.” Bannon emphasized that Carville’s comments reveal the Democrats’ weakening power, contrasting it with what he sees as a "total and complete” control held by the MAGA movement and Republicans in government. Bannon called for Republicans to protect their power by blocking Democratic judicial appointments, preparing for transitions in government leadership, and gearing up to confront the "Deep State” in the executive branch. He credited grassroots efforts for this success, including precinct strategies and volunteer work that helped turn the tide, particularly when official Republican resources were low. Bannon encouraged his audience to learn from Carville’s frustrations, playfully suggesting he might replay the clip, alongside other MSNBC coverage, to emphasize the Democrats’ "crushing defeat.” He concluded by pointing out that the Republican movement, though often underestimated, has now emerged as the dominant force.  Steve Stern and Steve Bannon discussed their grassroots strategy to empower the America First movement through local and state election integrity efforts. Stern highlighted the success of volunteer-based efforts to protect and mobilize the vote, particularly in precinct-level organization and early voting initiatives. He credited Bannon’s leadership in rallying support and ensuring transparency across multiple states. They emphasized the importance of vigilance in election security, especially with upcoming challenges. Stern invited listeners to join a special election integrity call featuring prominent speakers like Jovan Pulitzer, General Michael Flynn, and others who will address issues from ballot monitoring to border security.

In this exchange between Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell, they discuss the shifting political landscape in Europe and the growing influence of populist-nationalist movements. Bannon critiques the European political class, especially the elites in Brussels and NATO, who once thought President Trump and populism were finished, but now, with the rise of support for such movements, they are eager to reconnect. Both Bannon and Harnwell reflect on how their phones are now flooded with messages from people who had previously distanced themselves. Harnwell highlights the changing attitudes towards Trump, noting that even the UK is considering granting him a second state visit, showing the shift in global dynamics. They also touch on European issues, such as the Netherlands’ efforts to tackle migration and Italy’s increasing support for American-style populism, with people there looking to leaders like Trump for guidance. Bannon emphasizes the importance of delivering for the people, whether in or out of power, and stresses that the so-called “retribution” against corrupt elites is not about Trump but about representing the will of the American people. They conclude with a discussion on the ongoing fight against the political establishment, underscoring the rise of populism as a force for change.

Steve Bannon passionately outlined the appointments and vision of the incoming Trump administration, emphasizing the selection of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. He praised Gaetz as a fierce, relentless warrior, referencing his critical role in removing Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Bannon portrayed Gaetz as an anti-establishment figure poised to confront entrenched bureaucratic power, or what he calls the “Deep State.” Bannon suggested Gaetz’s nomination symbolizes Trump’s commitment to dismantling government corruption, with Gaetz as a "blow torch” to the Department of Justice. Additionally, Bannon celebrated the unconventional picks of Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence and other allies like Stephen Miller, signaling a radical reshaping of federal leadership under Trump. He spoke confidently about these individuals’ tenacity and described their intent to "deconstruct the administrative state,” targeting long-standing political figures such as Andrew Weissmann and Andrew McCabe. Bannon suggested that such individuals should prepare for rigorous legal scrutiny, hinting at intensified accountability efforts against perceived corruption. Throughout, Bannon framed the day as a pivotal, transformative moment for America, encouraging supporters to embrace the change they championed. He closed by expressing that this "hero’s journey” was only beginning and that the appointments would be instrumental in realizing Trump’s promise to restore America. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon talks about the factors that have made the re-election of Donald Trump into a mandate by the American people for him to set appointments and policies going forward.  Steve Bannon and Caroline Wren discussed the significance of Trump’s nomination of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. According to Bannon and Wren, Gaetz’s nomination marks a monumental shift in the U.S. political landscape, particularly as Trump seeks to regain control over what he views as a weaponized government. Gaetz, who previously faced DOJ investigations that were later dropped, represents someone uniquely suited to clean up the agency, Bannon argued, since he has experienced the agency’s alleged bias firsthand. Wren and Bannon emphasized that Gaetz’s Senate confirmation hearings could expose what they see as corruption within the DOJ. Bannon noted that the same DOJ that investigated Gaetz could face intense scrutiny during these hearings, potentially revealing evidence of political bias. Wren believes that the hearings might actually work to Gaetz’s advantage, allowing him to expose DOJ actions she describes as unjust. Both Wren and Bannon underscored Gaetz’s strategic skills, with Wren calling him a "master chess player” who’s often underestimated. They anticipate that, while the confirmation process will face opposition, particularly from some Republicans aligned with Mitch McConnell, Gaetz’s nomination could gain enough support. They concluded that Gaetz’s leadership in the DOJ could catalyze broader reforms, with Bannon viewing Gaetz as capable of dismantling what he calls the "deep state” and restoring justice.  Darren Beattie emphasized the critical importance of nominating Matt Gaetz as Attorney General in Trump’s second term, describing Gaetz as someone with a deep understanding of the "Deep State” and the determination needed to reform the Department of Justice (DOJ). Beattie highlighted Gaetz’s personal experience with an FBI investigation and his resilience through the ordeal, which he believes qualifies him to lead reform efforts at the DOJ. According to Beattie, Gaetz’s refusal to back down or compromise sets him apart as a true "warrior” against entrenched governmental corruption. Beattie argued that the DOJ, more than any other agency, represents the heart of American law and order, making its politicization especially dangerous. The current corruption within the DOJ, he contended, has led many Americans to view the country as a “banana republic,” where the justice system is used to target political enemies. For Trump’s administration to effectively combat these issues, Beattie believes Gaetz is essential as Attorney General to confront and dismantle the systemic rot within the DOJ and restore the rule of law. Beattie also encouraged readers to visit Revolver News to explore potential key appointments, including Scott Bessent for Treasury, emphasizing the importance of strategic leadership in advancing Trump’s agenda in a potential second term. Steve Bannon described the foundation of the America First movement as the Working Class Americans.  Steve Bannon delivered a fiery call to action, emphasizing that America stands at a "fork in the road” moment, demanding a drastic shift in governance and transparency. He argued that the administrative "Deep State” — intelligence, law enforcement, military, and media apparatuses — has morphed into a power the Founding Fathers never intended, stifling true democratic principles and forcing economic burdens on the average citizen. Bannon praised figures like Matt Gaetz as embodying courage and resilience against the government’s power. He likened their determination to the profiles in courage from history, insisting that, like him and Trump, they represent a spirit that cannot be broken. Bannon contended that the recent election showed a public mandate for a new form of governance, challenging mainstream portrayals of MAGA supporters as undemocratic. He underscored Trump’s plan to install "warrior” leaders, pledging a transparent, people-driven government. He cited historical resonance, invoking the upcoming 250th anniversary of Lexington and Concord, framing the movement as providential. Finally, Bannon warned that the establishment’s toughness would falter once stripped of power, vowing that the public, once exposed to the "truth,” would back Trump’s cause to restore America.

Steve Bannon, in a discussion with Mike Davis, criticized Senate Republicans for failing to counter Democrats’ push to confirm federal judges during the lame-duck session. He highlighted Elizabeth Warren’s leadership in advancing 28 pending judicial nominations and warned of the long-term impact these lifetime appointments could have on reshaping federal courts. Bannon and Davis emphasized the crucial role of appellate courts, where 99% of federal cases are decided, and noted that Biden’s judicial appointments could surpass Trump’s historic achievements. They argued that Senate Republicans must emulate Democrats’ obstruction tactics from Trump’s presidency by showing up to work, voting, and halting these confirmations. Bannon framed the judicial battle as essential to preserving the Trump Revolution and protecting constitutionalist principles, calling on Republicans to prioritize their responsibilities and take immediate action.  In this discussion with Steve Bannon, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) expressed concerns over the escalating Ukraine-Russia conflict, emphasizing that Congress has not formally declared war on Russia, yet U.S. involvement continues to intensify. She questioned what actions the House of Representatives could take to prevent further escalation, suggesting invoking the War Powers Act to ensure the President consults Congress. MTG also highlighted the lack of public support for war and criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict. MTG then shifted to another topic, criticizing the inclusion of a transgender member of Congress, Tim McBride, and the potential threat this poses to women’s privacy. She expressed concerns over men using women’s bathrooms and locker rooms, framing it as an assault on women’s rights. MTG demanded action from Speaker Johnson to protect women’s spaces, noting that the issue must be addressed in Congress’s rules. She concluded by rallying support for President Trump’s future administration, emphasizing the importance of unified resistance to the opposition, including Senators who voted for controversial appointments. MTG called for a focus on American sovereignty, the economy, and ending the military-industrial complex’s influence over Congress. She urged continued grassroots action to challenge the establishment and support America First policies. Part One:   Part Two:  Part Three:  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Garrett Ziegler discuss several key political issues. Ziegler starts by thanking Bannon for his support during Bannon’s time in prison and mentions his efforts to provide election night coverage. The pair criticize the left-wing media for undermining their reporting. Ziegler asserts that their focus on figures like Hunter Biden and the Biden family’s alleged corruption is crucial for the America First movement. They discuss the possibility of Joe Biden issuing pardons for his family, notably Hunter Biden, given his legal troubles. Ziegler suggests that Biden should issue blanket pardons, noting the legal jeopardy Hunter faces. Bannon agrees, emphasizing the dangerous conditions Hunter could face in federal prison, and calls for the justice system to hold all political figures accountable, particularly those involved in corruption. The conversation shifts to the need for stronger leadership in U.S. government agencies, with Ziegler advocating for the firing of corrupt officials in the DOJ and other institutions. They also critique the progressive overreach in agencies like the FCC and DOJ, calling for a return to a more accountable and constitutionally grounded system. Both express their concerns over the misuse of lawfare and the need for a stronger, more unified approach to restoring justice and accountability.

Alex Jones and Steve Bannon discussed the ongoing legal and financial turmoil surrounding Jones’ media platform, InfoWars. Jones described the situation as an unprecedented case of “lawfare,” alleging bankruptcy fraud and irregularities in an auction process meant to determine InfoWars’ ownership. According to Jones, the process was manipulated by Democrat-affiliated groups and Justice Department officials to undermine him and seize control of his brand. Jones recounted how the auction, supposedly authorized by a judge, shifted to a secretive and rigged bid favoring a politically connected group. This group allegedly pledged future earnings from defamation lawsuits against Jones, despite such bids being legally questionable. He highlighted that his team filed lawsuits against this process, claiming it violated bankruptcy laws. The judge overseeing the case expressed confusion and concern about the auction’s legitimacy. Jones detailed the immediate fallout, including a drastic drop in revenue and misinformation campaigns that confused supporters into believing his operations had ceased. He accused his adversaries of seeking to destroy the InfoWars brand by turning it into a parody site promoting progressive ideals, as revealed in internal documents and public statements. Despite these challenges, Jones vowed to continue broadcasting, asserting that his primary revenue streams remain intact. Bannon praised Jones’ resilience, likening his fight to the broader struggle against “weaponized” legal tactics targeting dissenting voices. Jones urged his audience to stay informed via his backup platforms while his legal battles unfold.  Mike Benz highlighted key dynamics surrounding the resistance to Donald Trump’s presidency and his potential second term, focusing on the battle for strategic appointments, particularly the FBI director. He underscored the entrenched opposition from establishment forces aiming to suppress Trump’s populist-nationalist agenda. Benz noted that this resistance manifests through coordinated efforts by the intelligence, media, and tech sectors to marginalize populist voices. Central to his critique was Mike Rogers, a former intelligence leader and contender for FBI director. Benz argued Rogers is emblematic of the establishment’s censorship apparatus, citing his affiliation with the Atlantic Council and its role in training journalists to identify "disinformation,” particularly targeting Trump. He linked Rogers to the CIA-backed International Republican Institute (IRI), which purportedly orchestrates global censorship initiatives, including Brazil’s anti-misinformation laws and the EU’s Digital Services Act. Benz contrasted Rogers with Cash Patel, a staunch Trump ally and advocate for government reform, emphasizing Patel’s alignment with the MAGA movement’s goals. He criticized the potential nomination of Rogers as compromising Trump’s agenda, asserting that the FBI director must share a cohesive vision with the Justice Department to avoid sabotage. The discussion also touched on broader institutional challenges, including the State Department’s alleged complicity in promoting censorship and undermining Trump’s policies. Benz concluded that Trump’s team must navigate complex political negotiations to secure appointees aligned with populist values while contending with establishment resistance.  Steve Bannon outlined a strategy for President Trump’s potential second term, emphasizing the importance of judicial appointments and Senate control. He highlighted the opportunity to appoint 20–25 judges early in the term, contrasting Biden’s current tally of over 300 judicial confirmations. Bannon criticized the Senate’s focus on an omnibus bill, arguing it distracts from critical battles such as blocking Biden’s judicial picks and combating Democratic strategies like pre-emptive hearings to target conservative figures. He stressed the need for “all hands on deck” in both the Senate and House to delay funding resolutions until after Trump’s inauguration, enabling a Republican-led budget overhaul. Bannon urged swift preparations for confirmations, recommending flooding the zone with nominees to overwhelm opposition and alleviate pressure on more controversial candidates. Bannon also endorsed figures like Russ Vought for leadership roles, citing their expertise in budget management. He called for rejecting inflated budgets, advocating for significant cuts to wasteful spending. Shifting focus, Bannon highlighted grassroots movements like Public Square as alternatives to mainstream commerce, aligning economic choices with conservative values. Lastly, he dismissed narratives undermining Trump’s mandate, asserting the former president’s legitimacy through popular and electoral victories while rallying conservatives to stay engaged in ongoing political fights.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon discussed the urgency of addressing critical economic, fiscal, and political challenges under a potential Trump administration. They emphasized the need for decisive action to combat rising debt, inefficient spending, and structural economic issues. Patrick highlighted specific priorities: reallocating unspent COVID and infrastructure funds to meaningful programs, closing the southern border to save on welfare costs, and expanding domestic energy production to bolster national wealth. He noted these efforts must complement growth-driven policies, as spending cuts alone cannot address the $2 trillion deficit. Bannon underscored the economic challenges exacerbated by government-driven employment and stagnant productivity, warning that the current system is unsustainable. He stressed that Trump’s team must implement supply-side reforms, tackle the deficit, and address the looming expiration of tax cuts for the middle and working classes. The duo also addressed geopolitical tensions and the economic fallout from the Ukraine war as critical areas requiring immediate attention. On practical steps, Patrick recommended using Birch Gold for hedging investments through precious metals as a safeguard against economic instability. Together, they urged viewers to remain vigilant and proactive in the fight for economic recovery and political accountability.  Natalie Winters addressed the residence and sabotage of President Trump, his picks to lead his administration, and his America First policies by the elite in the media and in government jobs in Washington DC, who were continuing on in their efforts as public servants to thwart Trump and his supporters.  Activist Cleta Mitchell gives an update on the Elections she is following from around the country that have still not been called.  Cleta Mitchell talks to Steve Bannon about replacing part of the National Voter Registration Act.

Steve Bannon commented on the growing pressure from the left-wing Democrats and Wall Street figures like Mark Rowan regarding the Trump administration’s Treasury situation. Bannon emphasized the centrality of the Treasury role in implementing President Trump’s economic program, which he views as crucial to revitalizing the country. He stated that the Treasury is perhaps even more important than the Attorney General in advancing Trump’s economic policies, which many supporters rallied behind. However, Bannon raised concerns about Mark Rowan, the head of Apollo, a major Wall Street firm, saying that figures like him—representing "predatory capitalism”—may not align with Trump’s vision. He criticized the practice of outsourcing jobs to China for cheaper labor, which he sees as detrimental to American interests. Bannon suggested that if Trump were to bring people like Rowan into his administration, it would undermine the economic revival he aims to achieve. He jokingly compared it to bringing in figures like Larry Fink or Leon Black, who represent the same establishment interests. Bannon also pointed out that the transition team is still deliberating, as evidenced by Trump’s lack of firm decisions, and expressed frustration with the way Fox News was downplaying issues related to the transition. He noted that the edge that Representative Matt Gaetz brought to the conversation was missing, and the transition team needed to "reboot” and find fresh momentum with strong nominees. According to Bannon, Gaetz had been the "tip of the spear,” driving the narrative and pushing back against establishment forces.  Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon engaged in a fiery discussion about the FBI’s current state, its leadership challenges, and the role of figures like Kash Patel and Mike Rogers. Both agreed that the FBI has strayed from its original mission due to cultural and political rot at its senior levels, emphasizing the need for a thorough overhaul. Bannon criticized the public integrity unit for politicizing justice and called for purging leadership to restore the FBI’s credibility. He highlighted Trump’s vision of appointing leaders committed to reform but lamented Senate confirmation challenges. Posobiec and Bannon expressed skepticism about figures like Rogers, alleging his involvement in past controversies like Russiagate and close ties with establishment figures like James Clapper. They accused media outlets, including Fox News, of pushing narratives to undermine the populist-nationalist movement and surround Trump with moderate appointees. The conversation emphasized the divide between rank-and-file FBI agents and its leadership, with Bannon challenging the lack of whistleblowers amidst alleged abuses. He also criticized Fox News and the Murdochs for promoting establishment-friendly narratives, contrasting it with their commitment to dismantling and rebuilding the FBI to better serve Americans. The discussion underscored a broader battle between populist forces and entrenched establishment players, with Bannon framing the struggle as critical to preserving the MAGA agenda. Both concluded with a call for vigilance and action, underscoring their commitment to challenging perceived corruption and systemic failures within the U.S. government.  In a heated conversation, Steve Bannon and Jeff Clark discuss their skepticism about being convicted in Washington D.C. courts, criticizing the jury pool, which they view as biased towards progressive left-wing government employees. Bannon argues that the D.C. judiciary, particularly the district and circuit judges, is corrupt and should be reformed. He stresses the importance of legal defense and warns that those involved in high-profile cases, like Rudy Giuliani, have faced financial ruin due to expensive legal battles. Both Bannon and Clark advocate for a deep structural overhaul of government institutions, particularly the FBI, which they claim is politically biased against conservatives and populists. They argue that the FBI’s influence has grown unchecked, with power consolidating among career bureaucrats rather than elected officials, undermining the Constitutional separation of powers. Clark emphasizes the need for a unified executive branch with the president in full control, rather than a fractured system where unelected bureaucrats exert undue influence. He critiques the rise of the “administrative state,” which has evolved since the Progressive Era, and warns against proposals to put parts of the FBI under dual supervision, arguing this would only exacerbate the issue. They both express a desire to dismantle this “deep state” and restore accountability to government agencies, comparing their efforts to the fall of empires like Carthage. Bannon concludes by highlighting the fight against a system that they believe undermines democratic values and accountability.  In a this conversation between Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, the discussion centered on a significant legal victory for President Trump, which was a temporary win in New York. Bannon highlighted that while this ruling is a victory for Trump, it’s essential to recognize that the left-wing legal apparatus, led by figures like Norm Eisen, is already preparing to continue its efforts. Winters pointed out that even though Trump’s team has won this round, the lawfare strategy against him remains relentless, with a focus on accountability for what they see as political attacks. Bannon emphasized the danger of the lawfare apparatus, which he views as a significant threat to American democracy. He noted that the “Resistance” movement, including individuals like Jamie Raskin and Jerry Nadler, are jockeying for power in Congress, signaling that the left’s push to undermine Trump and his supporters is far from over. According to Bannon, these attacks are aimed at a long-term strategy to eliminate political opposition and protect a system that works against conservative ideals. The conversation also brought attention to Eisen’s group, the States United Democracy Center, which has been involved in pushing election integrity measures aligned with the left-wing agenda. Winters revealed that this group circulated a memo to the Arizona Attorney General’s office, pushing for actions that align with their broader efforts to disrupt conservative movements and ensure that power remains with the political establishment. Bannon’s tone was clear: while victories like these may seem significant, the lawfare effort will continue unabated until there is accountability for those responsible.

Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters had a fun and pleasant conversation about her points of view on numerous news headlines and topics, and Winters gave her reaction to trending news. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon and Frank Gaffney discuss U.S. foreign policy, focusing on Israel’s conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, alongside broader global tensions. They criticize the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, alleging it undermines Israel’s security by empowering hostile forces like Hezbollah and Iran. Gaffney claims Biden’s policies contradict the pro-Israel sentiment of American voters and impede Netanyahu’s efforts to neutralize threats. They accuse the administration of using extortion tactics, such as weapon supply delays and leveraging U.N. resolutions, to coerce Israel into unfavorable agreements. The discussion links these actions to a broader agenda of weakening U.S. allies and prioritizing adversarial regimes. Gaffney draws parallels to Obama-era strategies, suggesting an overarching continuity in policies allegedly hostile to Israel. He promotes initiatives like the "Working Group on Israel” to counter these trends. Turning to Ukraine, Bannon and Gaffney express concerns over escalating tensions, including potential tactical nuclear deployment. They frame this as part of a Chinese strategy to entangle U.S. resources globally, hindering its ability to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. They argue for restraint, suggesting Trump could negotiate peace and realign U.S. priorities. Their conversation underscores skepticism about current U.S. leadership and advocates for a robust response to global challenges.  Steve Bannon and Robbie Starbuck discussed Starbuck’s efforts to challenge wokeness in corporate America, describing it as a battle against a “new form of communism” that seeks to control the minds of corporate leaders rather than seizing production. Starbuck outlined his strategy of targeting companies reliant on conservative consumers, forcing them to abandon woke policies by demonstrating financial consequences. Notable successes include Harley-Davidson, John Deere, and Tractor Supply, which faced significant losses due to consumer boycotts. Starbuck highlighted Walmart as a turning point, negotiating a shift away from woke policies. He emphasized that consumer-driven backlash reshaped the corporate landscape, as companies began recognizing their dependence on regular Americans rather than ESG-driven entities like BlackRock or Vanguard. Bannon noted how woke ideologies infiltrated corporations through mechanisms like CEI scores and international advocacy groups pushing "a new type of capitalism.” Starbuck explained that such frameworks replaced traditional profit-driven leadership with ideologically aligned executives. Looking ahead, Starbuck urged the next Trump administration to prioritize dismantling woke frameworks through DOJ investigations and executive orders, particularly by addressing civil rights violations linked to DEI programs. He also suggested aligning federal contracts to discourage woke policies. Both agreed that this grassroots movement was reshaping corporate America, with Bannon calling it an economic battle to restore traditional values and economic fairness.  Jacqueline Toboroff talks about her thoughts and opinions about President Trump’s choice for Surgeon General.  Natalie Winters shares her thoughts and feelings about President Trump’s Surgeon General pick.

Bannon highlights Trump’s use of tariffs as a powerful tool against key trading partners—Mexico, Canada, and China—demanding action on issues like fentanyl and border security. He recalls Mexico’s swift response to Trump’s tariff threats, deploying troops to address migration concerns. Tariffs, according to Bannon, expose the inefficiencies of globalist institutions and align with American workers’ interests by pressuring governments to reform. He criticizes Wall Street-backed media for defending a failing system that suppresses wages for low-skilled American workers by promoting mass immigration and global competition. This strategy, he argues, prioritizes corporate profits over citizens’ welfare, driving down wages while elites reap benefits. Bannon claims tariffs would reverse these trends, increasing wages and strengthening American sovereignty. Concluding, Bannon asserts that the populist movement holds the moral high ground, focusing on economic policies benefiting American workers. He calls for bold tariff measures, believing they could dismantle the Chinese Communist Party and realign global trade in favor of U.S. interests.  Steve Bannon outlined a three-pronged strategy for reshaping government and advancing populist-nationalist policies. First, he emphasized “deconstruction of the administrative state,” targeting the entrenched bureaucratic systems that overreach into citizens’ lives. Bannon praised Russ Vought for his detailed plans to reduce federal spending and dismantle inefficient programs systematically, not just through deregulation or firing bad actors. Second, he stressed economic nationalism, including tariffs and trade policies to strengthen domestic industries. Bannon commended figures like Kevin Hassett for shifting toward populist economics and underscored the importance of a unified strategy under Trump’s leadership. Finally, Bannon addressed national security concerns, warning against escalating tensions in Ukraine, including reports of potential deployment of tactical nuclear weapons. He called for a focused effort to manage these priorities through Project 2025, emphasizing preparation with expert teams to ensure swift and effective action if Trump takes office in 2025.  In a this conversation between Kari Lake and Steve Bannon, they discussed the urgency of addressing illegal immigration under President Biden’s administration, focusing on the “Biden invasion” that began on January 20, 2021, and its impact on the U.S. border. Bannon argued for a focused approach, proposing that deportation efforts should target individuals who arrived after Biden took office, estimating this number at around 10 million. He emphasized the importance of defining this effort clearly and humanely, acknowledging that many immigrants were lured by economic interests and the Biden administration’s lax policies. Lake agreed, asserting that this deportation should be prioritized and humane, while stressing the need to send individuals back to their home countries, particularly those trafficked or involved in criminal activities. She suggested using a combination of tariffs and foreign aid to pressure countries to take back their citizens, especially as the U.S. faces global security threats, including from China. Bannon and Lake also discussed the role of foreign aid and U.S. policy, with Bannon criticizing the current administration’s approach to foreign aid, which he believes exacerbates issues like climate change and poverty. They called for a shift in foreign aid to focus on combating communism and fostering economic stability in other countries, rather than promoting progressive ideologies. Both agreed that President Trump’s economic strategies, including tariffs and negotiations, could help address the illegal immigration crisis and restore order to the U.S. border. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters sheds light on the ongoing efforts by the”Deep State” to undermine President Donald Trump. Winters argues that there is a concerted effort to pre-label Trump as an autocrat to delegitimize his political influence and agenda. This tactic, she asserts, is part of a larger strategy by establishment elites and bureaucratic insiders to control the narrative and prevent the populist-nationalist movement, which Trump has championed, from gaining further momentum. According to Winters, this effort is not just about targeting Trump personally, but about framing any challenge to the status quo as inherently dangerous to democracy. By labeling Trump as an autocrat, critics aim to stoke fear and paint his policies as authoritarian, even when they are rooted in American values like national sovereignty and individual freedom. This framing is seen as a way to delegitimize the concerns of millions of Americans who support Trump’s platform. Winters points to the media’s role in amplifying this narrative, as well as the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, which she argues are politically motivated attempts to weaken his influence. She believes that by preemptively labeling Trump as a threat to democratic norms, the Deep State is trying to sideline the populist movement and prevent meaningful change in Washington. Winters argues that this effort to label Trump an autocrat is not just a personal attack on the former president, but part of a broader battle over control of American politics and governance.  Steve Bannon outlines a powerful critique of the American political system, framing it as deeply flawed and working against the interests of the American people, especially the working and middle classes. He argues that the “system defenders” cling to outdated institutions that need reform, purging, and renewal, echoing the concept of “creative destruction” that has historically driven societal progress. Bannon emphasizes the necessity of addressing the “unitary theory of the executive,” asserting that the president’s executive authority, especially in national security and law enforcement, should not be undermined by the deep state or administrative bureaucracy. He passionately defends his legal battles over executive privilege, stating that he would willingly serve time again to uphold these principles. Bannon criticizes the judiciary and Department of Justice (DOJ) for corruption, calling for a total overhaul, including firing U.S. attorneys and reshaping the DOJ with a more aggressive approach. He warns that unless populist forces seize key institutions, meaningful reform is impossible. He challenges figures like Mitch McConnell, who he believes protect the institutional status quo, and underscores the urgent need for reforming the administrative state to ensure it serves the American people rather than the elites. Ultimately, Bannon calls for a strategic fight to seize control of the institutions to effect real change.

Steve Bannon’s remarks on Black Friday touched on economic policy, tariffs, and precious metals as tools for stability during turbulent times. He highlighted President Trump’s use of tariffs as both a protective measure for industries and a negotiation strategy. Bannon noted the impact of these tariffs on major trading partners like Mexico, Canada, and China, emphasizing their necessity for addressing trade imbalances and generating revenue amid a growing deficit. While acknowledging the short-term inflationary effects, he stressed their long-term benefits in incentivizing domestic manufacturing. Bannon expressed optimism about Trump’s economic team, which he believes is equipped to tackle deficits, stimulate GDP growth, and boost energy production through decisive policies. He warned of market volatility until Trump assumes office and detailed plans are implemented but remained hopeful about stabilizing economic trends. Shifting focus, Bannon underscored the importance of investing in gold and precious metals as hedges against financial uncertainty. He encouraged viewers to educate themselves on economic fundamentals and explore resources like the "End of the Dollar Empire” report. While recognizing the challenges ahead, Bannon conveyed confidence in Trump’s leadership to navigate the economic storm and lay the groundwork for long-term prosperity.

Steve Bannon and Rob Bluey discussed the upcoming challenges and critical actions President Trump will face upon taking office. They highlighted the importance of Trump’s executive orders on day one, which could range from immigration reforms to addressing the national debt and trade issues. Bannon emphasized the need for a swift and efficient Senate confirmation process to ensure that Trump’s team is in place to implement these orders, especially with a looming resistance from the “deep state” in the federal bureaucracy. Bluey shared a poll showing that nearly 50% of federal employees plan to resist Trump’s directives, particularly those who voted for Kamala Harris. He stressed that, unlike Democrats in 2021, Republicans must urgently confirm Trump’s cabinet to avoid delays in his agenda. The conversation also touched on the broader issue of entrenched bureaucrats who remain in power across administrations, undermining the president’s authority. Both Bannon and Bluey agreed on the need for action and unity among Republicans to support Trump’s priorities. They concluded by mentioning Daily Signal’s focus on Congress and their efforts to cover the confirmation hearings and provide timely updates on the administration’s progress.  Josh Pettit and Steve Bannon discussed the challenges in California politics, highlighting that the state’s problems are as deep, if not deeper, than those at the federal level. Pettit emphasized that despite efforts like recalling Governor Gavin Newsom or addressing local political incompetence, the core issues in California lie within its entrenched administrative and bureaucratic structures. He pointed out that California’s most powerful lobby isn’t the tech or labor lobby but the environmental lobby, which has shaped state politics for decades. The environmental industrial complex, Pettit explained, has gained immense control, particularly through agencies like the California Department of Water Resources and the California Coastal Commission. These agencies, he argued, hinder vital infrastructure projects such as water storage capacity, which could address California’s long-standing water shortages. Despite record rainfall in recent years, Pettit stressed that money allocated for water infrastructure had been misappropriated and funneled into environmental projects that benefit lobbyists and consultants. Pettit also discussed how California’s environmental laws, especially the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), have been weaponized to block projects. This, combined with constant litigation, delays critical infrastructure projects, leading to inefficiencies like the stalled high-speed rail project. Ultimately, Pettit warned that no political change could address California’s deep-rooted issues without dismantling these bureaucratic systems. He plans to expose this in future discussions further.  David Drucker joined the discussion, highlighting the strategic thinking behind the upcoming political battles, particularly focusing on the midterm elections. He pointed out that figures like Hakeem Jeffries are preparing to raise two billion dollars to flip key seats and regain control of the House. This power shift would set the stage for another round of impeachment efforts against former President Trump, signaling a return to familiar political confrontations. Drucker noted the significant involvement of high-profile figures like Mark Zuckerberg, who contribute millions to influence the outcome. He also referenced his piece in The Dispatch, where he discussed how political players anticipate these moves and position themselves strategically for the midterms.  Natalie Winters recounted recent events involving Mark Zuckerberg.  Darren Beattie talked about his recent investigations into the actions of Norm Eisen and Jen Rubin.  Ben Freeman talked his investigations into the actions of think tanks in the United States.  Natalie Winters mocked Michael Cohen

In a conversation about election dynamics, Steve Bannon, Natalie Winters, and Jack Posobiec analyze anticipated voter behavior and the mainstream media’s framing of a potential “red mirage.” Winters criticizes the media’s narrative as an attempt to preemptively undermine Republican wins by blaming delayed ballot counts. She highlights that changes in election laws will likely reduce delays in key states, potentially preventing scenarios like those seen in 2020. Posobiec emphasizes high turnout among working-class, rural voters in Pennsylvania, particularly men, describing this as a “populist uprising.” He notes sparse turnout in urban Democratic strongholds, contrasting with strong GOP participation in rural areas. The group also discusses Project 65, a legal group targeting Trump-aligned lawyers, and points out that government agencies are closely monitoring polling in swing states. They argue that these actions reveal the Democrats’ “lawfare” tactics, suggesting attempts to undermine GOP voting efforts. Bannon and Posobiec wrap up by expressing disdain for Democratic leaders and highlighting their platform as a counter to media narratives, emphasizing a populist, anti-establishment movement in the run-up to the 2024 election.  In a discussion with Steve Bannon, Cliff Maloney emphasized a robust Republican effort in Pennsylvania, detailing a field campaign with 120 workers aiming to reach 500,000 doors by election night. Maloney expressed confidence in the Republican ground game and mail-in vote strategy, reporting that Republicans are closing the gap in areas traditionally dominated by Democratic mail-in ballots. He argued that Democrats are failing to mobilize the same level of turnout as 2020, potentially weakening their strongholds. Bannon and other speakers noted shifting voter sentiments, particularly among African American men in Philadelphia, indicating a growing dissatisfaction with Democratic policies. While Democratic strategists like Jonathan Martin highlighted an impressive ground game in Pennsylvania, Bannon countered that Republicans’ targeted efforts are paying off. Both Bannon and Maloney underscored the importance of turnout, especially from first-time and low-propensity voters, to secure a victory in Pennsylvania.  In this discussion, Ben Bergquam and Jordan Conradson report on two key issues from Maricopa County on election day. First, Bergquam reveals a leaked ICE memo directing agents in Arizona and Pennsylvania not to wear uniforms or badges when voting, citing concerns that it might deter or “spook” non-citizens present at polling sites. Bannon criticizes this directive as disrespectful to ICE agents, viewing it as an unnecessary accommodation for illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Conradson describes extensive wait times at Arizona polling locations, noting that Maricopa County’s lengthy four-page ballot takes voters around 30 minutes to complete, contrary to the county’s estimated 10–12 minutes. This is causing long lines, raising concerns of delays similar to those seen in 2022. Despite these challenges, Republicans report an early lead over Democrats in Arizona, though turnout remains crucial.  Steve Bannon and Lara Trump expressed confidence in the Republican voter turnout for Election Day, highlighting significant early voting and long lines in key battleground states. She noted efforts to address voting issues, including poll watcher access and machine problems. Lara emphasized the GOP’s targeted strategy of mobilizing low-propensity voters, which particularly benefits Trump. She also reported a decrease in urban turnout alongside increased rural participation, which she believes favors Republicans. Bannon discussed minority voting patterns, with Lara citing high polling support for Trump among African-American, Hispanic, and Arab-American voters. Lara remained optimistic about North Carolina staying red, citing effective local voter outreach. She encouraged Republicans to stay informed via social media updates on any voting issues, aiming to boost confidence and encourage turnout.  Sam Faddis, discussing Pennsylvania’s voter turnout with Steve Bannon, emphasized an unprecedented level of in-person voting participation, suggesting that early mail-in voting had not detracted from Election Day turnout. Reporting from his precinct and various regions statewide, Faddis described exceptionally high voter engagement, with lines and wait times, such as two-hour waits in places like Hamburg near Allentown. Areas like Bradford and Northumberland Counties, as well as Erie, reported record turnout. Faddis highlighted that these numbers surpassed anything previously seen in Pennsylvania, indicating strong overall participation. He directed listeners to follow updates via AND Magazine’s Substack and his social media.  In this discussion, Steve Bannon and Kash Patel analyzed current polling data and turnout in key states. They noted that Trump, in 2020, was down by an average of 8.4 points at this stage, while in this cycle, he trails by only one point. Patel emphasized Nevada’s turnout, highlighting high voter participation in Las Vegas’ Clark County, where Republicans now lead by 45,000 votes compared to trailing by 145,000 in 2020. He urged voters in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin to get to the polls, believing that Trump has the numbers to win if supporters turn out. The conversation also touched on reports from Philadelphia and Arizona, where Bannon described “machine state” tactics, mentioning Democratic operatives and long voting lines in urban areas. Patel and Bannon expressed concern about an email directing ICE agents in Arizona and Pennsylvania not to wear uniforms or badges while voting, speculating this might be intended to avoid intimidating non-citizens at the polls. They found this directive troubling, seeing it as a slight against ICE agents.  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse discuss strategies and emerging data regarding Republican voter turnout and potential victories in key regions during an election. DeGrasse emphasizes Republican gains in Guam and early indicators of strong GOP performance in places like Florida and New York, where Republicans reportedly lead Democrats by significant margins in voter turnout. He also highlights New Hampshire’s unexpectedly high turnout and close races, signaling competitive dynamics. The two also discuss the importance of New York congressional seats, which could block Democrat Hakeem Jeffries from gaining a majority in the House. Bannon and DeGrasse urge Republican voters to remain calm and patient, particularly in high-turnout areas, to counteract any potential delays or challenges. DeGrasse mentions the deployment of election integrity teams and lawyers to oversee potential issues and encourages voters to document irregularities. The goal, they emphasize, is a smooth and legally solid process to ensure Republican victories and certify results swiftly. Both assert that these proactive efforts are crucial for the GOP’s path to control in the House.

Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris gave her concession speech on Wednesday afternoon. Natalie Winters and Steve Bannon each reacted to the confusing speech.  Natalie Winters discussed the opponents of President Trump, who was declared the winner of the 2024 Presidential elections in the early morning hours of Wednesday. Winters told Steve Bannon that she has seen evidence in public statements that people are devising plans and organizing to fight Trump and his agenda in various ways.  In their discussion, Ret. Lt. Col. Mike Flynn and Steve Bannon outline concerns about anticipated obstacles facing Donald Trump if he returns to office. They describe political opposition as a “battlefield” where Trump’s adversaries will attempt to thwart his agenda from the start. Flynn emphasizes that preparations must begin now, including forming a dedicated team capable of enacting swift reforms and dismantling entrenched structures within government agencies. He suggests immediate personnel changes upon Trump’s hypothetical inauguration, targeting high-level bureaucrats who may obstruct Trump’s policies. Flynn also underscores the importance of Trump’s physical security, advising him to establish a secure base of operations at Mar-a-Lago and rely on specialized military personnel over the Secret Service, whose integrity he questions. Bannon and Flynn propose a bold restructuring of federal agencies and advocate for strong accountability measures. They argue that Trump must enact sweeping policies, including a robust deportation plan, a return to energy independence, and a regulatory rollback to bolster the economy. Both insist that this approach would restore America’s global stature and meet the demands of Trump’s base for accountability, suggesting a potential task force or commission to investigate political adversaries and swiftly address internal corruption. Flynn and Bannon envision Trump’s leadership as essential to reversing what they view as America’s current instability and restoring control domestically and internationally.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon recently discussed concerns over the U.S. economy, with Patrick highlighting the national debt as America’s top security issue, stating, "Debt service payments last fiscal year were 50% above U.S. defense spending.” He explained that high debt levels limit domestic spending and increase dependency on foreign creditors, which he agreed makes the U.S. vulnerable. Patrick also saw recent developments as a rejection of Bidenomics and a vindication of sound fiscal policies, though he acknowledged that Trump would inherit a more challenging economic landscape than in 2016. Turning to financial markets, Patrick and Bannon addressed the recent highs in gold prices. Patrick noted that "central banks have been moving into gold at record levels,” seeing this as a response to U.S. deficit spending and international concerns about dollar stability. He encouraged listeners to consider diversifying into precious metals, suggesting that viewers visit Birch Gold to learn more. Addressing accusations that Bannon aims to destabilize the dollar, he clarified that his “End of the Dollar Empire” series is intended as a "cry for help,” urging policy reforms. Patrick expressed frustration over media misrepresentations and emphasized the series’ intent to highlight economic issues, not advocate the destruction of the dollar.  Natalie Winters talked about the difference between supporters of President Trump and his opponents and said she believed a big difference in the agenda of the two groups was whether or not to put America first in the actions of the Federal government.  In this discussion between Richard Barris and Steve Bannon, the two analyzed the evolving situation in Arizona’s election results, focusing on Carrie Lake’s chances of overcoming her deficit and the broader implications for President Trump’s position. Barris noted that while Lake was trailing by 59,000 votes, there were still a million outstanding votes, primarily from Maricopa County, which tends to report slowly. He emphasized that while Lake could still win without Maricopa, her path to victory depended on gaining significant margins in upcoming ballot dumps. Barris explained that Trump’s lead of nearly 5 points in Arizona would likely help drag Lake across the finish line if the results continued to favor her in key counties. The conversation then shifted to a broader discussion about the strength of Trump’s coalition, which Barris argued was stronger than in previous elections. Trump had managed to expand his support among college-educated whites, working-class voters, and diverse communities, including Black and Hispanic voters. Barris praised the inclusivity of Trump’s coalition, suggesting it resembled a mandate, and pointed to states like New Jersey and New York as areas where the GOP could find future opportunities. He warned against backsliding into establishment politics and urged a continued focus on populist-nationalist policies. Barris concluded by inviting listeners to follow his analysis on Locals.

Natalie Winters discusses a report that shows illegal immigrants are going to surge at the US’s open borders.  Oscar El Blue Ramirez, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, discussed the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border in the context of shifting immigration policies and the 2024 election. He described a recent surge in migrants, with a caravan of over 3,000 people arriving on Election Day. Many migrants believed Kamala Harris would win, making it easier to enter the U.S., but the prospect of Trump’s stricter policies has led some to reconsider or return home. Ramirez noted that the Biden administration’s CBP One app, which allows migrants to apply for asylum from within Mexico, has seen increased use. He mentioned that many migrants now come from diverse regions, including Central and South America, the Middle East, and South Asia. According to Ramirez, organized crime, including cartels, profits from the migration surge by charging migrants for assistance in crossing into the U.S. through Guatemala and Mexico. He also accused international organizations of encouraging migrants to enter before Trump possibly returns to office. He criticized Biden’s administration for financially supporting Mexican NGOs and facilities that, he claims, facilitate migration. Ramirez argued that the U.S. should stop federal grants to these NGOs, which he believes operate as proxies, complicating border security efforts. He warned that mass deportations under a potential Trump administration could lead to protests and chaos at the border, with organized crime and activist groups involved in exploiting the crisis.  Steve Bannon highlighted that "personnel is policy,” underscoring the critical role of staffing for a future Trump administration. He believes that top White House staff should be announced immediately to set a decisive tone. Bannon argues that prompt, careful selection will be crucial, particularly in light of what he perceives as previous failures in staffing and policy implementation. Bannon criticized figures like Jeff Miller, a lobbyist closely tied to Kevin McCarthy, whom he blames for the “disastrous debt ceiling deal” and the out-of-control spending that followed. Miller, in Bannon’s view, represents corporate interests—especially in areas like immigration reform, favoring cheap labor policies that align with Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Bannon suggests Miller is deeply connected with major corporate clients and is lobbying within Trump’s orbit, which he sees as a potential problem. To counter this influence, Bannon advocates for staffing that reflects “populist principles.” He supports figures like Susie Wiles, who, despite her reserved style, has proven effective and steady in past campaigns. Ultimately, Bannon asserts that a solid, aligned team will be essential for Trump’s policies to succeed and appeal to the expanding coalition of American citizens seeking real change.   Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse discussed the status of Republican control in the House and the Senate, highlighting both the importance of current seats and the role of outstanding races in securing a GOP majority. DeGrasse noted that the Associated Press has called 209 seats for Republicans, with 219 needed for a majority, and confidently projected that Republicans would secure at least 219 with expected wins in several key races. "The Associated Press will call them soon,” he said, referring to GOP-leaning districts in Arizona, California, Nebraska, and Washington that he believes will solidify the count. DeGrasse also emphasized ongoing efforts in key battleground states, pointing to close races in California and Colorado that could raise the GOP seat count to 221. He highlighted the tight race in Colorado’s Aurora district, an area significant to the MAGA movement, where Republicans hold a slight lead. Bannon and DeGrasse were optimistic but cautious about potential surprises in tight races, especially in states like California. Bannon framed the situation as part of a larger battle, with the GOP needing to hold the House to prevent Democrats from using it as a tool "to bring down MAGA and President Trump.” DeGrasse expressed confidence, saying that the GOP could reach up to 222 seats in a best-case scenario, depending on final vote counts and outcomes in toss-up districts.  Natalie Winters explains the weaponization of the Institutions by the Democrats who abused their power against President Trump’s movement , his family and himself.

Mike Davis emphasized the need for aggressive oversight by Congress, especially concerning the Biden administration’s use of “lawfare” to target former President Trump. Davis supported House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan’s move to demand documents from Special Counsel Jack Smith, indicating that a special prosecutor might be necessary to investigate the perceived bias and interference in Trump-related prosecutions. He pointed to actions by officials connected to the Biden administration, alleging coordinated legal moves in various states to hinder Trump’s candidacy. Davis criticized the prolonged ballot counting in Democrat-controlled states, contrasting it with quicker processes in states like Florida. He argued that inconsistencies in election administration raise doubts about democracy’s integrity. He underscored the need for voter reform, including proof of citizenship and voter ID, to restore public confidence. Davis concluded by calling for a robust Congressional response to prevent law enforcement and intelligence agencies from allegedly acting against elected leaders. He urged Senators, particularly Chuck Grassley, to continue probing the origins of investigations into Trump, framing these actions as essential to protecting American democracy from undue influence.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly discuss Representative Jim Jordan’s recent letter to Special Counsel Jack Smith, instructing him to preserve documents related to alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Kelly, a long-time advocate for accountability in this area, highlights the significance of this move, especially considering ongoing legal controversies surrounding Trump’s case in Florida. She claims there is documented evidence of collusion between the Biden administration, DOJ officials, and the National Archives to target Trump. Kelly mentions instances of mishandled evidence, witness tampering, and threats, specifically calling out prosecutors Jay Bratt and David Harbach for alleged misconduct. She believes House Republicans should investigate these actions thoroughly and consider pursuing criminal charges. Additionally, Kelly points readers to her detailed reports on Smith’s alleged misconduct, emphasizing the need for serious oversight. She suggests that House and Senate Republicans must scrutinize these allegations to ensure accountability within the DOJ.  In this conversation about the Arizona Senate race, Caroline Wren and Steve Bannon discussed Kari Lake’s unexpectedly close contest with Katie Hobbs. Wren highlighted the efforts of Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, who have provided detailed, district-by-district updates, revealing that Lake could potentially secure a win as the vote count narrows. She pointed out that many outstanding ballots are in Maricopa County, an area favorable to Lake, making the race even tighter. Wren explained the focus on “ballot curing”—correcting issues with ballots to ensure they’re counted—and mentioned that several conservative groups are actively assisting with this process, resulting in high curing rates for Republican voters. Despite their efforts, she expressed frustration with Arizona’s slow vote-counting process, attributing delays to a lack of transparency and Governor Katie Hobbs’ veto of proposed reforms to improve ballot processing efficiency. With Senate leadership elections approaching, Wren speculated that delays may be aimed at preventing Lake’s timely participation. She called for financial support to prepare for a potential recount, stressing that even small contributions could make a difference in securing Lake’s victory.  Steve Bannon and Mike Davis discussed the potential retirement of Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Davis addressed rumors and Democratic calls for Sotomayor to step down, possibly allowing the Biden administration to appoint a replacement. Davis argued that Senate Republicans should halt any attempts to confirm new judicial nominees before they regain Senate control in January. He suggested Senator Mike Lee as a key figure to block any rapid confirmations by utilizing Senate procedures that allow a single senator to slow the process significantly. Davis supported the idea of Sotomayor remaining in her position, dismissing Democratic efforts to replace her with another liberal judge as partisan. He emphasized the importance of preserving the vacancy for a future Trump nominee, citing the Republican majority in the new Congress. The Article III Project, led by Davis, plans to help Trump secure judicial nominations if he reclaims the presidency, aiming to prevent any last-minute Biden appointees to lifetime judicial positions.  In this discussion between Steve Bannon and Bill McGinley, the two highlighted concerns about alleged Democratic efforts to undermine Republican victories and President Trump’s agenda. McGinley commented on the Pennsylvania race, where David McCormick appeared to have a substantial lead, suggesting Democrats are attempting to challenge election outcomes they dislike, portraying their actions as hypocritical “election denialism.” He argued that Democrats aim to prevent Republicans from securing future majorities by stirring controversy and leveraging dark money for legal battles. McGinley emphasized the strength of the coalition Trump built with working- and middle-class voters, saying it was instrumental in recent successes and could fortify Republican control in future Senate races. McGinley predicted a proactive approach from a potential Trump administration, aimed at reversing Biden-era policies through mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act. He voiced support for civil service reform to align federal workers with elected leadership. Citing conservative judiciary appointments as an advantage, he forecasted a strategic response to Democratic “resistance,” warning of midnight regulations and judicial nominations pushed by the Biden administration to impede a Republican agenda. The conversation underscored a belief in Trump’s mandate to reduce government overreach and pursue a populist agenda in the second term.  Part Two:  Natalie Winters talks about the weaponization of the Federal government and what she thinks would have happened if President Trump had not won the presidency. Part One:  Part Two:

In his commentary with Natalie Winters, Steve Bannon critiques mainstream media, particularly MSNBC, for allegedly ignoring the influence of a broad coalition of supporters and advisors behind the success of populist movements. He mentions prominent figures such as Bill Ackman and David Sacks, while emphasizing the importance of precision and clear messaging in countering what he sees as misinformation from the left. Bannon advocates for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate alleged wrongdoing and outlines ambitious goals for immigration reform, including mass deportations, to reshape U.S. demographics and political power. Bannon views growing Hispanic support as a key to building a durable political majority, likening it to the realignment seen in the 1930s. He discusses a “reckoning” for federal bureaucracies, a focus on states’ rights, and anticipates intense political battles against Democratic governors and state officials who oppose Trump’s policies. He forecasts a 2028 Democratic primary marked by high-profile governors, signaling a significant cultural resistance. Bannon predicts gender issues will increasingly overshadow racial issues, driven by a cultural shift against traditional power structures, which he believes will define future populist and nationalist debates. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec discussed a cultural struggle they see as a deeper fight than politics. They describe it as a battle between a "radical, Bolshevik, atheistic” worldview versus a Christian-Western foundation, with implications for societies beyond the U.S., including East Asian countries. Bannon argues that traditional values are under attack, citing trends in South Korea, China, and Japan where family and cultural traditions are weakening. Posobiec points out that these shifts mirror the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao promoted the "Four No’s” (no old ideas, culture, customs, or habits), viewing current cultural shifts on social media, especially TikTok, as similar. They highlight a new "4V” trend in South Korea as a reaction to this, where women reject modern norms in favor of traditional roles. Posobiec sees a cultural shift in the U.S. as well, with young women increasingly supporting populist ideas and Trump, reflected in polls showing an 11-point shift among women under 30 toward Trump since August. They connect this trend to a "bro culture” influence, where women align with traditional values and assertive male figures. Bannon sees this as part of a larger societal pushback against modern liberalism and a return to traditionalism, reinforced by media and cultural symbols. Posobiec also discusses several political issues, including the ongoing election battles in Pennsylvania and Arizona. He criticizes Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania senator, for his silence amid allegations of voter fraud, such as unverified ballots and signature discrepancies, calling out the incompetence and corruption surrounding these processes. Posobiec also mocks Casey’s efforts to appear active by tweeting about ballot counting, suggesting he should look for work at McDonald’s in Pennsylvania due to his lack of significant achievements. Turning to Arizona, Posobiec highlights the controversial and slow vote counting in Maricopa County, where large discrepancies in vote totals have raised concerns about transparency and integrity. He emphasizes the need for proper ballot chain-of-custody and ensures that volunteers working tirelessly for the election are recognized, particularly through organizations like Turning Point Action. Posobiec stresses the importance of securing a victory for Carrie Lake in the Senate and achieving a majority in the U.S. Senate, which he believes will strengthen President Trump’s political agenda. He encourages supporters to get involved, whether physically or virtually, to help safeguard election integrity and ensure Republican success.  Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon discuss the need for a special counsel to address ongoing corruption and legal issues, particularly around the mishandling of the Trump case. Giuliani, who has extensive knowledge of the situation, expresses willingness to assist in any investigation, emphasizing that the case is a miscarriage of justice and could set a dangerous precedent if not properly addressed. He criticizes former prosecutor Trey Gowdy, calling him ineffective and accusing him of failing to act during key moments in the investigation. Giuliani also raises questions about Gowdy’s mysterious departure from Congress, suggesting a possible connection to his lack of action. Giuliani also shares his personal legal struggles, detailing his ongoing battle with the 145 million dollar judgment and his claims of being unfairly treated by the justice system. He explains that key evidence, such as video recordings, has been altered or removed to deceive the court, and that his financial accounts and assets have been frozen, leaving him in dire circumstances. He argues that the case against him is a setup, orchestrated by powerful figures involved in corruption, including ties to Ukraine, and claims that ordinary people wouldn’t face such harsh treatment. Giuliani underscores the injustice of his situation, as well as the broader corruption at play.

Mike Davis and Steve Bannon criticized the FBI’s handling of January 6th, focusing on revelations from the Inspector General (IG) report. Davis highlighted concerns over the use of 26 confidential human informants at the Capitol, questioning why some informants were not prosecuted like other January 6th defendants. He called for a fresh investigation into the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) to address alleged weaponization of intelligence agencies. Davis suggested replacing the longstanding DOJ Inspector General with someone new to ensure accountability. He advocated for a special grand jury to investigate “Crossfire Hurricane,” alleging it was part of a broader effort by Democrats to weaponize law enforcement against political opponents. Davis tied this to previous events, including the Mar-a-Lago raid and alleged cover-ups of Hillary Clinton’s foreign dealings. Bannon emphasized the political timing of the IG report’s release, accusing the FBI of strategically dropping it to undermine upcoming reforms by Kash Patel, whom Bannon claimed would bring significant accountability to the FBI. Both speakers encouraged the War Room audience to continue pressuring senators to confirm Patel and support broader judicial reforms. The conversation framed these issues as critical to exposing and dismantling corruption within federal agencies. Davis underscored the importance of public action, citing the War Room Posse’s success in mobilizing thousands of contacts to influence senators. Both maintained optimism about achieving reforms through persistence and public engagement.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly criticized Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s recently released 88-page report on January 6th, dismissing it as inadequate and misleading. Kelly mocked the report’s heavy reliance on filler content, including Attorney General guidelines and already-available transcripts from the January 6th Committee, despite claims of access to 500,000 pages of documentation. Kelly questioned the report’s assertion of 26 FBI confidential human sources (CHS), citing defense attorneys’ skepticism. She argued that without a centralized FBI database or thorough field office inquiries, the figure is unreliable. Kelly also highlighted Horowitz’s dismissal of undercover FBI agents’ involvement, based solely on statements from FBI officials and DOJ policies. She called this approach disingenuous, given ongoing concerns about the FBI’s transparency and tactics. Both Bannon and Kelly agreed the report served as a tool for mainstream media to discredit legitimate questions about FBI informants’ roles in January 6th. They emphasized the need for new DOJ leadership, with Kelly asserting only Donald Trump could fire Horowitz and appoint an inspector general willing to conduct thorough investigations. Bannon and Kelly concluded that the report fails to address key issues, leaving serious questions about FBI involvement and government accountability unanswered.  Darren Beattie and Steve Bannon dissected the revelations from the recent Inspector General (IG) report on January 6th, sharply criticizing the media and FBI for misleading narratives. Beattie began by lambasting mainstream media for their “bait-and-switch” tactics, accusing them of using technicalities to downplay the FBI’s involvement. “The big lie is…none of the [26 confidential human sources] worked for the FBI full-time,” Beattie said, calling this a convenient narrative designed to mislead the public. Beattie highlighted inconsistencies in the FBI’s account, pointing to how confidential informants (CHS) were embedded with militia groups and reported in real-time to their FBI handlers. Despite their involvement, none were prosecuted. “Is it simply statistical chance that not a single CHS was charged with anything, even those who entered the Capitol?” he asked, asserting that this de facto immunity suggested tacit authorization. Steve Bannon built on Beattie’s points, emphasizing the leadership’s complicity. He noted that one FBI informant was the vice president of the Oath Keepers, further evidence of compromised leadership in key militia groups. Both agreed that FBI Director Christopher Wray had lied to Congress and withheld critical information, a failure Bannon described as "disgraceful.” Beattie concluded that these revelations vindicate critics of the January 6th narrative while exposing institutional failures. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Philip Patrick discussed the alarming state of U.S. national debt and economic policy. Patrick highlighted the staggering $624 billion budget deficit in just the first two months of the fiscal year, marking the worst start to a year in U.S. Treasury history. This marks a continuation of a worrying trend, with the U.S. deficit reaching new heights and projections indicating that another trillion dollars will be added in just 100 days. They framed this explosion of debt within the context of the Trump administration’s fiscal policies and the broader global tensions, including proxy wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Bannon stressed the immense impact of this fiscal recklessness, likening it to a “runaway train” and underscored the burden of debt on average Americans, who are facing rising inflation and an economic downturn. He pointed to the mounting debt, now comparable to a “second mortgage” for individuals, as driving inflation and worsening the financial outlook for U.S. families. They also discussed the volatility in financial markets, with Patrick noting that the stock market is now at historic highs, fueled by printed money and unsustainable fiscal policies, which he argued will ultimately lead to a market crash. Both urged listeners to consider precious metals like gold as a hedge against the inevitable economic turbulence.  Natalie WInters talked about her reaction to current events and her recent appearance with Piecre Morgan. Part One:  Part Two:   Steve Bannon criticized the lack of accountability within the U.S. political system, specifically pointing to the Hunter Biden laptop story, where he claimed that no one faced consequences for their actions. He expressed disdain for the absence of a strong value system and the government’s failure to self-investigate. Bannon warned that without intervention, the system would continue its downward spiral, and called for the removal of those in power. He also criticized modern monetary policies, particularly how they contribute to financial instability, arguing that the elite class avoids responsibility for the consequences of economic collapses, such as the 2008 crisis. Bannon believes this has sparked populist movements, which reflect widespread anger and disillusionment with the establishment. He drew comparisons to historical uprisings, warning that the same kind of anger could lead to violent outcomes if ignored. Bannon further emphasized the disconnect between the elites and the common people, pointing out that despite the promises of hope and change from Obama, the financial and social systems remain broken. He argued that the political elite, particularly those in neoliberal and neoconservative circles, have consistently failed to address the real issues facing ordinary Americans. Bannon also touched on the upcoming 2024 election, stating that the "anti-system” players were on the rise, predicting that the fight would not focus on issues like abortion but rather on the survival of the system itself.

Steve Bannon and Dave Bratt engaged in a wide-ranging conversation touching on politics, Ukraine, and the global implications of U.S. foreign policy. Bannon, reflecting on his role in the populist-nationalist movement, discussed his recent interactions at the New York Young Republicans Club dinner, which had become a significant gathering for nationalist thought. He highlighted the contrast between President Trump’s powerful speech and the crowd’s response, emphasizing the vibrant populist energy surrounding these events. Bratt, who had recently visited Ukraine with Christian leaders and think tank members, provided insights into the ongoing war, focusing on the political maneuvering of NATO countries. He explained that while he sympathizes with the Ukrainian people, he sees the West’s involvement as a manipulation, with nations like the U.S. and NATO seeking to maintain influence in the region. Bratt critiqued the narrative pushed by the U.S. government and its intelligence agencies, framing it as an example of failed diplomacy and foreign intervention. He pointed out the U.S. role in the 2014 Ukrainian coup and the lack of accountability for such actions, which he believes have led to the current crisis. Both men expressed skepticism about the motivations behind the war in Ukraine, with Bannon questioning the justifications for continued support. Bratt emphasized the need for a more honest conversation about the war’s roots and its broader geopolitical implications. They also touched on the role of Christian leaders, asserting that faith communities should seek peace and reconciliation rather than contribute to further division. Ultimately, both Bannon and Bratt called for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy, urging a shift toward prioritizing national interests and moral clarity. Part One:  Part Two:  Ben Bergquam, Oscar Ramirez, and Steve Bannon discuss the serious implications of illegal immigration and border security as President Trump prepares for his transition to office. Bergquam highlights the dangers posed by illegal alien “runners,” individuals trying to avoid detection while crossing the southern border, often with criminal backgrounds. These figures are facilitated by cartels exploiting asylum loopholes, leading to an influx of dangerous individuals. Oscar Ramirez echoes this concern, emphasizing the cartel’s growing power under the Biden administration, calling for immediate action to label cartels as terrorists and to leverage tariffs against Mexico to curb their operations. Bannon expands on the broader context, critiquing the Biden administration for exacerbating the border crisis and the political resistance to closing the border. He highlights the challenge President Trump faces, especially with the entrenched opposition from Republican senators like Mitch McConnell, who have been dismissive of the America First movement. Bannon stresses the need for immediate action on securing the border, including mass deportations, and insists that border security must be prioritized over other legislative concerns. He calls out McConnell for undermining Trump’s agenda and promoting an open-border policy, positioning it as a direct betrayal of American interests. The trio emphasizes that only President Trump has the will to address the crisis effectively and humanely, despite significant political resistance.

In this discussion between Ben Bergquam and Steve Bannon, they addressed the ongoing challenges at the U.S.-Mexico border and broader societal implications. Bergquam described his recent observations in San Diego, highlighting the surge of illegal immigrants, sanctuary policies protecting them, and organizations like Catholic Charities facilitating their entry. He criticized what he called the “illegal alien industrial complex,” alleging that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international entities profit from these activities while undermining American sovereignty. Bergquam linked the border crisis to a broader agenda, claiming it paves the way for domestic destabilization, including potential terror attacks and civil unrest similar to past events like the George Floyd riots. He warned of pre-positioning efforts by NGOs and complicit media to resist immigration reforms under a future Trump administration, despite the November 5th election results signaling public demand for change. Bannon emphasized that modern politics has evolved into a form of warfare, where systemic resistance to MAGA policies persists regardless of electoral outcomes. Both discussed the need for defunding and prosecuting organizations collaborating with cartels or undermining U.S. laws. They urged vigilance against what they described as a deliberate effort to create chaos and render illegal immigration permanent. The conversation highlighted concerns about national security, the weaponization of government apparatuses, and the erosion of public trust in institutions, framing these issues as part of a larger battle over America’s future.  Steve Bannon and Ava Chen discussed the current state of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Xi Jinping’s leadership, analyzing Xi’s New Year’s message and its implications. Bannon highlighted Xi’s declaration that Taiwan is a province of China and his warnings against foreign interference. Chen described the dire state of China’s economy, worsening living conditions, and growing resistance to the CCP, noting these signs of desperation could lead to extreme measures. Chen pointed out Xi’s increased control over Macau and Hong Kong, emphasizing the CCP’s use of threats against Taiwan. She connected current events to past warnings, such as the U.S.-China trade talks in 2019, where Xi’s regime allegedly hinted at opening a "Pandora’s box,” later linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. She outlined the CCP’s strategy, including economic manipulation, cyberattacks, and propaganda, aimed at destabilizing the West. Bannon and Chen warned of the CCP’s collaboration with Russia in escalating conflicts, such as the Ukraine invasion, and its long-term agenda against the U.S. Chen underscored the importance of exposing the CCP’s tactics through independent media like the New Federal State TV, calling for vigilance against these threats.  Steve Bannon and Brian Kennedy discussed the resilience of the American people in defending their nation and the challenges posed by the “dark enlightenment” narrative. Kennedy dismissed claims that Americans lack the morality and energy to preserve their civilization, citing grassroots efforts and the Trump movement as proof of their resolve. He emphasized the need to dismantle the administrative and Deep State, aligning with Trump’s vision for governance. The discussion contrasted this belief in self-governance with the technocratic, post-national ideologies promoted by figures like Elon Musk, who envision a future detached from the U.S. Constitution and sovereignty.  Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell discussed tensions within the MAGA movement, focusing on H1B visas and their impact on American workers. Harnwell argued that the movement, rooted in working-class support, faces challenges from billionaire elites pushing for policies like expansive immigration reform. He called for loyalty to President Trump while holding him accountable when necessary. Bannon emphasized unwavering support for American workers, advocating a total moratorium on immigration, legal or otherwise, citing concerns over abuses in programs like H1B. Both criticized President Trump’s promotion of a Boston Globe editorial, noting the publication’s anti-MAGA stance. They resolved to stay aligned with MAGA’s foundational principles, rejecting corporate and elite influences.

Steve Bannon talks about the announcement that Joe Biden will pardon his son, Hunter, and his belief that Hunter would not last in any federal prison.  Natalie Winters talked about the pardon for Hunter Biden.  Natalie Winters talked about the corruption with the family of Democrat Joe Biden.  Dr. Malone criticizes the ongoing bird flu scare, calling it another round of fear-mongering with little evidence to support concerns. He points out that previous cases of bird flu, such as those in Canada and California, have not led to significant health issues or human-to-human transmission. He dismisses this as psychological bioterrorism, meant to stir panic. Dr. Malone shifts focus to a recent House report on COVID-19, which he claims provides conclusive evidence that the pandemic originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and that the World Health Organization (WHO) withheld crucial information to protect the Chinese Communist Party. He also highlights the report’s criticism of lockdowns, quarantines, and vaccines, labeling them as failures. Malone calls for WHO Director-General Tedros to resign, asserting that Trump’s team should approach global health institutions cautiously, possibly withdrawing from the WHO and reconsidering involvement in organizations like the World Economic Forum. He further criticizes the NIH, especially under former leaders like Fauci, for its role in the pandemic response and its overall dysfunction. He recommends significant budget cuts and a complete overhaul to ensure the NIH serves the American people effectively. Malone believes that Trump should focus on dismantling problematic agencies and prioritizing national interests over globalist agendas.  Mike Benz talked about his investigations into corruption in Ukraine.  Julie Kelly joined Steve Bannon in the War Room to discuss what she sees as the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) weaponization against the defendants on January 6th, contrasting it with the leniency shown toward Hunter Biden. Bannon opened the discussion by framing January 20, 2025, as "Accountability Day,” emphasizing the need for justice for those he described as political prisoners. Kelly detailed how recent DOJ actions have ramped up against January 6th participants, even four years after the event, alleging that federal authorities are targeting individuals to weaken the “patriot movement.” She described these efforts as punitive and vengeful, with defendants facing harsh penalties, excessive pretrial detentions, and what she called "torture-like conditions.” The conversation shifted to Hunter Biden’s recent plea agreement and the leniency he has been afforded despite allegations of serious crimes committed while his father was in office. Kelly argued that Biden’s pardon groundwork opens the door for similar clemency for defendants on January 6th, highlighting the disparity in how the justice system has handled the two cases. "This isn’t about enforcing the law equally,” Kelly said. "It’s about punishing political dissent.” She called for a comprehensive review and potential pardons for those prosecuted for January 6th, asserting that the DOJ’s actions have been politically motivated and destructive to the justice system’s credibility.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly engaged in a detailed critique of key individuals and institutions they allege are responsible for politically motivated prosecutions following January 6. The discussion highlighted figures such as Attorney General Merrick Garland, Deputy AG Lisa Monaco, and U.S. Attorney for D.C., Matthew Graves, accusing them of weaponizing legal proceedings against Donald Trump and his supporters. Graves was singled out as a central figure in pursuing harsh sentences, including those for “seditious conspiracy” and obstruction charges, which Kelly argued were politically driven and unprecedented for non-violent offenders. They examined Graves’ connections, notably his ties to the Biden administration and his wife’s involvement in left-wing activism, claiming systemic bias. The conversation also addressed judges overseeing January 6 cases, emphasizing Judge Amit Mehta and others who allowed stringent charges and excessive sentences, suggesting a broader judicial alignment with the prosecution’s agenda. Bannon and Kelly linked these actions to a strategy aimed at discrediting Trump and MAGA supporters. The conversation concluded with a vow to expose these individuals publicly and hold them accountable post-2025. Bannon warned law firms against hiring Graves, pledging to organize protests and campaigns against such moves. The dialogue framed the ongoing prosecutions as a violation of constitutional rights, likening them to authoritarian show trials, while emphasizing Trump’s potential to overturn these actions upon reelection. Kelly’s investigative work on these cases was also promoted as a resource for uncovering perceived injustices. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Part Four:   In this conversation between Steve Bannon and Sheriff Mack, they discussed strategies for addressing illegal immigration and the role of Constitutional sheriffs in implementing humane deportation policies. Sheriff Mack emphasized that while the military could assist at the border, sheriffs are uniquely positioned to identify and address immigration issues locally. He highlighted the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of relying on sheriffs’ localized knowledge rather than complex federal operations. Sheriff Mack criticized the Biden administration’s border policies and sanctuary city practices, calling for accountability and prosecution of officials aiding illegal immigration. He praised President Trump’s courage and forward planning, expressing support for a Constitutional approach to law enforcement and immigration reform. Mack also warned against poor administrative appointments, such as a Florida sheriff he deemed unqualified for a federal role, urging Trump to prioritize experienced Constitutional sheriffs. Bannon and Mack agreed on the importance of coordinated efforts, with sheriffs playing a central role in ensuring community safety and effective immigration control. Bannon highlighted Trump’s bold economic and trade policies as complementary to border security, emphasizing tariffs as leverage to influence foreign governments’ actions on immigration and drug trafficking.

The Friday WarRoom conversation between Steve Bannon and Mark Lucas centered around supporting Pete Hegseth’s nomination and the broader effort to push grassroots advocacy for conservative causes. Bannon emphasized the importance of resilience in leadership, highlighting Hegseth’s ability to withstand criticism and deliver results. He praised grassroots organizations like Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) for their effectiveness in driving policy changes under Hegseth’s leadership, such as significant VA reforms during Trump’s presidency. Lucas detailed the success of the Article 3 Project’s Action Center, which mobilized grassroots support for confirmations like Kash Patel’s and is now rallying for Hegseth. He encouraged activists to use the platform to contact senators in support of Hegseth. Lucas countered media narratives that criticized Hegseth’s tenure at CVA, asserting that his leadership left a strong foundation that facilitated significant legislative victories. The discussion also touched on media misrepresentation and the challenges of navigating political opposition. Bannon and Lucas stressed the importance of conservative media and advocacy groups in countering misinformation and advancing their agenda. They credited Hegseth’s vision and organizational skills with shaping key early victories for Trump, such as VA accountability reforms. Bannon concluded by reiterating the need for sustained grassroots engagement and media presence to combat left-wing narratives and support key conservative figures. Both speakers underscored the value of strategic grassroots efforts in achieving political goals. Part One:  Part Two:  Natalie Winters reacted to the tactics of the Democrats.  Part Two:  Steve Bannon discussed his support for Mike Benz in constructing the administrative state.  In a wide-ranging discussion, Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec analyzed recent political developments involving Senator Joni Ernst, Pete Hegseth, and Kash Patel, framing them as part of a broader populist movement against entrenched bureaucratic systems. They highlighted Joni Ernst’s pivotal role in advocating for fair hearings, particularly for Pete Hegseth, whose nomination faced widespread media skepticism but gained momentum through grassroots and MAGA support. Despite media claims of his defeat, Hegseth continues to rally backing, including from Ernst, showcasing the power of organized populist advocacy. The conversation pivoted to Kash Patel, whose candidacy as FBI Director has drawn endorsements from law enforcement groups and national security experts. Bannon and Posobiec praised Patel’s experience and contrasted it with prominent political figures like Kamala Harris. They emphasized that the establishment fears accountability, citing preemptive pardon discussions for figures like Mark Milley and Dr. Fauci as a reaction to the potential reforms Patel represents. The discussion closed with breaking news of the resignation of a Navy JAG involved in controversial COVID policies, interpreted as a sign of growing accountability. Bannon and Posobiec portrayed these developments as victories for their movement, signaling a shift in the balance of power.  Naomi Wolf discussed the media’s tactics of using illnesses like the Bird Flu to distract from political events that they did not want to see elevated.  In this conversation, Dan Fluette and Steve Bannon discussed the latest developments surrounding the film and book projects they have been working on. Fluette highlighted the impact of their film, which focuses on Kash Patel’s candidacy for FBI Director. According to Fluette, the film goes beyond a typical election call-to-action film, delving into the corruption within the FBI and other government agencies. Fluette emphasized that watching the film would not only provide a deep understanding of the inner workings of the Deep State, but also give insight into Patel’s qualifications and the mandate he would bring to clean up these agencies. Fluette suggested that people watch the film as it is an essential tool for understanding why Patel is the best candidate for FBI Director and why his expertise is crucial for the future. Fluette further noted the popularity of the film among political staffers, who find it easier to consume in under an hour compared to reading books. He stressed that this film is especially timely, as it lays out the actionable information that Patel would use to reform the FBI. Fluette recommended viewers download the film over the weekend and share it with others to better understand the significance of the issues at hand. Shifting gears, Fluette and Bannon also discussed a book titled The Pictorial History of the War Room. Bannon praised the photography and writing in the book, calling it a stunning collection that showcases the spirit and heroes of the War Room program. Fluette explained that the book was intended not just as a political statement but as a work of art—designed to stand alongside the best coffee table books. He expressed hope that readers would appreciate the book as both a visual and historical document that celebrates the power of alternative media in shaping modern political discourse. Fluette emphasized that the book is not just a gift for War Room supporters but also a historical record of the times they are living in. He suggested that people buy multiple copies to give as Christmas gifts and noted that it has already become a popular item for this purpose. For those interested in obtaining the book, Fluette directed them to Amazon and Barnes & Noble. He also provided his social media handles for further updates and encouraged followers to stay connected. In conclusion, Fluette and Bannon both expressed their excitement for upcoming events, including one in Washington, D.C., and highlighted the major influence their projects are having on the political landscape.

Natalie Winters highlighted the numerous successes of the WarRoom audience.  Joe Allen discussed the most recent details known about the Assassin who killed the United HealthCare CEO in New York City in early December.  Natalie Winters talked to Mike Benz about the details of his investigation into the overthrow of Assad and his leadership in Syria.  Julie Kelly talked about the shocking case of an 81 year old who attended events at the US Capitol on Jan 6 2021 and who was sentenced to one year confinement in a Federal Prison.  Jacqueline Tobroff talked about the Acquittal of Daniel Penny, who stood trial for killing a man in New York City.  Steve Bannon and Yoram Hazony discussed pivotal geopolitical shifts in the Middle East and their implications. Bannon noted the escalating pressure on the Iranian regime following a series of setbacks, including the weakening of its proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, as well as the Assad regime in Syria. Hazony attributed these developments to decisive military actions by Israel under Prime Minister Netanyahu, which demonstrated the viability of a military strategy against Iran’s regional ambitions. Hazony outlined three key coalitions shaping the Middle East. The first is Iran’s axis, comprising Iraq, Yemen, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The second is led by Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who aims to resurrect the Ottoman Empire and establish a Sunni caliphate, supported by Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. Hazony stressed Erdoğan’s antagonism toward pro-Western Gulf monarchies, highlighting his ambitions to control Mecca, Gulf oil wealth, and Jerusalem. The third coalition consists of Israel and moderate Arab regimes in the Gulf, united against both Iranian expansionism and Erdoğan’s Islamist aspirations. Hazony warned that Iran’s decline could inadvertently empower Erdoğan, whose ambitions pose a significant threat to regional stability and could embolden Muslim Brotherhood movements globally, including in Europe and the U.S. Both commentators underscored the high stakes of this geopolitical struggle, cautioning against leaving a power vacuum that could enable authoritarian or Islamist forces to dominate the region.  Part Two:  In their conversation, Steve Bannon and Cynthia Hughes passionately discussed the plight of January 6th detainees and broader issues of governmental “weaponization.” Hughes noted that President Trump, channeling the frustration of advocates like herself and others, has committed to providing immediate relief for these detainees upon taking office, though achieving this will face resistance in Congress. Hughes highlighted the dire circumstances faced by nearly 350 individuals jailed for their roles in the January 6th events. Many have endured nearly four years in prison, faced exorbitant legal costs, and suffered irreparable personal losses, such as broken marriages and estranged families. She detailed the case of Julian Khater, who, despite his prolonged imprisonment and harsh treatment, remains emblematic of what many detainees endure. Hughes stressed that systemic mistreatment in prison, including torturous conditions, cannot go unaccounted for. Bannon echoed this sentiment, calling for justice and accountability for those who orchestrated and allowed such treatment. He emphasized the moral obligation to prevent such abuses from recurring, tying this responsibility to America’s constitutional principles and revolutionary heritage. Both underscored the necessity of pardons but acknowledged that many detainees also face extensive civil litigation, requiring sustained support. Hughes also described her group’s ongoing efforts to provide legal, financial, and emotional assistance to detainees and their families, particularly during the holiday season, as many families face their fourth Christmas apart. They stressed the need for broader public awareness and action to combat governmental overreach and restore justice.  In their conversation, Steve Bannon and Nicole Nogrady reflected on the inspiration behind her song, Modern Day Holy War, which stemmed from the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019. NoGrady recalled watching the flames consume the historic landmark, describing the moment as a “lightning strike” of divine inspiration. The phrase “modern day holy war” came to her almost instantly, prompting her to begin crafting the song, though the process of writing and producing it took years to complete. NoGrady noted the significance of the song’s release, which coincided with the one-year anniversary of its debut on Bannon’s show and the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral five years after the fire. She described the timing as divinely orchestrated, aligning with global events and themes of religious and cultural struggle. Bannon expanded on the broader context of modern-day holy wars, referencing historical and ongoing conflicts in regions like Syria, the re-emergence of Turkish ambitions for an Ottoman revival, and tensions involving Persian Islamic supremacy. He framed these struggles as reflective of a spiritual battle tied to the birthplace of Christianity, especially poignant during the Christmas season. To conclude the discussion, Bannon praised NoGrady’s work, emphasizing its spiritual and cultural resonance. The segment closed with the full airing of Modern Day Holy War to mark its anniversary, underscoring its enduring message of faith and resilience.

On January 3, 2025, Steve Bannon reflected on the political shifts marking the new year, focusing on the 118th Congress and its historical significance. He highlighted the grassroots effort that led to the unprecedented removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, underscoring the audience’s critical role in reshaping political leadership. McCarthy, now pursuing ventures in artificial intelligence, symbolizes the shift from establishment politics to a movement rooted in populist accountability. Bannon emphasized the erosion of the constitutional republic, attributing the nation’s decline to a betrayal of its foundational principles and the exploitation of its sovereignty by elites. This discontent, he noted, was the catalyst for Donald Trump’s rise in 2016, defying a well-funded and fragmented Republican establishment. Bannon recounted pivotal moments like Dave Brat’s grassroots victory over Eric Cantor in 2014, illustrating the power of citizen-led revolts against entrenched interests. Bannon criticized the Biden administration’s handling of immigration, claiming millions of illegal entries had strained resources and disadvantaged American citizens, particularly minorities. He argued that both legal and illegal immigration systems were rigged against the average American. Concluding, Bannon called for renewed focus on the "task and purpose” of Congress under Speaker Mike Johnson. He urged his audience to remain engaged, using their agency to hold leaders accountable and advance Trump’s agenda. The ultimate goal, he stressed, is not just navigating obstacles but defining the movement’s path forward with clarity and purpose.  Steve Bannon delivered a wide-ranging commentary on the structural, procedural, and policy challenges facing Congress and the nation, highlighting the complexities of governance and the interplay of political and economic forces. He criticized backroom deals in Congress, particularly under Kevin McCarthy, which he claims betrayed voters and deepened the national debt. He praised the structural reforms achieved during the 118th Congress, such as empowering conservatives on the Rules Committee and increasing transparency in appropriations, but emphasized the need for continued vigilance and reform. Bannon underscored the stakes of the 119th Congress, including the selection of a Speaker and critical legislative battles over border security, crime reduction, and government weaponization. He argued that fiscal mismanagement, exemplified by deficits and unrestrained spending, is pushing the U.S. toward bankruptcy. Bannon criticized reliance on the Federal Reserve’s money-printing and warned of global challenges to the dollar’s dominance, driven by inflation and alternative currency strategies from BRICS nations. He stressed the importance of citizen engagement and transparency, encouraging Americans to understand legislative processes and hold politicians accountable. Bannon also touched on pressing issues such as the Ukraine conflict, border security, and immigration reform, framing them as critical to U.S. sovereignty. He concluded by urging bold leadership to address the nation’s economic and geopolitical crises, portraying the current moment as pivotal for restoring conservative values and national stability.  Steve Bannon outlined his strategy and expectations for addressing pressing political issues under a prospective Trump administration. He emphasized the need for strategic decision-making, leveraging timing, and prioritizing critical objectives. These include resolving the financial crisis, ending foreign conflicts without direct U.S. involvement, addressing illegal immigration, and dismantling the administrative state. Bannon acknowledged the challenges ahead but underscored the necessity of these steps to fulfill the populist agenda. Bannon expressed dissatisfaction with current political realities, including the complexities of selecting a Speaker of the House and the limitations of legislative processes. He supported using reconciliation to bypass Senate filibusters and fast-track critical policies. His proposed focus for reconciliation includes immigration reforms, such as border security, deportations, and visa overhauls, coupled with energy policies to bolster the "Make America Great Again” agenda. Reflecting on Trump’s anticipated second term, Bannon advocated for an aggressive, multifaceted approach, including executive orders to reverse Biden-era policies. He suggested that legislative and executive actions be launched simultaneously, creating momentum and overwhelming opposition. Bannon also criticized the establishment and deep state for obstructing reform efforts, highlighting the need for precision and resilience in leadership. While skeptical of Speaker candidate Mike Johnson’s capabilities, Bannon emphasized the importance of unity and clear direction to navigate upcoming political turbulence. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon passionately addressed the audience, emphasizing the need for the 119th Congress to bring transformative changes to “Make America Great Again.” He criticized the establishment’s legislative agenda, particularly the “Dignity Act,” which he described as favoring foreign workers over American citizens. Bannon called for a moratorium on immigration and a reevaluation of current policies, arguing that the system exploits American workers to benefit corporate and global interests. He criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for failing to deliver substantive reforms, accusing him of negotiating behind closed doors and pushing a 1,500-page spending bill riddled with wasteful provisions. Bannon called for accountability and transparency, urging his audience to demand promises be kept. Bannon highlighted “kitchen table issues,” emphasizing the financial struggles of American families. He argued that unchecked immigration undercuts wages and economic opportunities for citizens, particularly minorities. Drawing historical parallels, he suggested that the MAGA movement could create a “1932-style coalition” uniting African Americans, Hispanics, and working-class Americans disillusioned with the Democratic Party. He urged the audience to stay vigilant, stressing the fight against entrenched powers, such as corporatists and financial elites, who prioritize endless wars and wealth concentration over citizens’ well-being. Bannon framed this struggle as a moral imperative to prioritize American workers and families, advocating for policies that support economic self-sufficiency and national sovereignty. In conclusion, Bannon painted the ongoing political battle as a defining moment for restoring American values and empowering the working class. Part One:  Natalie Winters joined Steve Bannon to echo Bannon’s point of view on the H-1B Visas and Dignity Act interference. Part Two:  Steve Bannon delivered an impassioned critique of the current political and economic landscape, emphasizing the urgency of reform within the GOP and broader U.S. governance. He highlighted the Freedom Caucus’s reluctant support for Speaker Johnson, driven by loyalty to President Trump rather than Johnson’s policies. Trump, Bannon noted, has been a pivotal figure in unifying factions within the Republican Party around his agenda. Bannon criticized the entrenched reliance on “easy money” and modern monetary theory, likening it to addiction that requires a painful detoxification process. He underscored the need for fiscal responsibility, highlighting the burden of debt and high-interest rates. This, he argued, necessitates prioritizing American citizens over expenditures on foreign aid and illegal immigration. The speaker race and broader Congressional inaction were central to Bannon’s critique. He accused Republican leaders of performative politics, citing failures in defending border security and energy independence. He condemned policies that auctioned off border wall materials and called out GOP complicity in enabling President Biden’s fiscal agenda. Bannon also spotlighted the dangers of unchecked immigration, particularly from countries like China, framing it as a threat to American sovereignty. He advocated for systemic reforms to asylum laws and immigration policies to prioritize American workers. Finally, Bannon outlined preparations for a potential second Trump term, emphasizing the importance of staffing key positions to ensure swift action. He called for accountability within government institutions and robust efforts to dismantle entrenched bureaucracy and ideological opposition.

In their exchange, Steve Bannon and Congressman Chip Roy delved into critical issues surrounding Congress’s reconciliation processes, budget debates, and House Speaker Johnson’s leadership. Roy expressed frustration over insufficient guardrails for conservative priorities and the lack of a structured reconciliation plan that aligns with deficit reduction and border security. He emphasized the need for a robust rules committee to ensure conservative legislation reaches the floor, advocating for a two-bill approach to separately address border security and broader spending reforms. Roy criticized recent events, including the controversial 1,500-page spending bill negotiated with Democrats, calling it a failure of leadership and a betrayal of conservative principles. While he acknowledged Speaker Johnson’s efforts and apologized missteps, Roy stressed the necessity of accountability and a shift away from rushed, opaque legislative processes. Bannon echoed Roy’s concerns, highlighting the urgency of delivering clear wins on Trump-era policies like border security and energy reforms, which underpin the MAGA economic agenda. Both emphasized the importance of swift action and vigilance to ensure future legislative efforts reflect conservative values and public mandates. The discussion concluded with a shared commitment to holding Speaker Johnson accountable and securing decisive legislative victories.  Steve Bannon emphasized the importance of the WarRoom audience as the “vanguard” in addressing the challenges facing the United States. He highlighted issues like massive budget deficits, administrative state overreach, and unsustainable debt. Bannon critiqued legislative strategies, advocating for clear and decisive action, particularly on border security, immigration, and energy policies. He called for swift passage of focused bills that prioritize working-class interests, criticizing corporate and lobbyist influence over policymaking. Bannon urged transparency and accountability, emphasizing that Americans, particularly MAGA supporters, have the common sense to support meaningful reforms. He warned of tough times ahead but expressed optimism that populist priorities like fair taxation and economic reforms could prevail. Stressing urgency, he called for comprehensive investigations, particularly into immigration and January 6-related matters, to ensure nothing is hidden from the public. His closing message emphasized determination and the need for immediate wins in advancing populist goals.  Steve Bannon hosted Mike Davis on WarRoom to discuss the breaking developments surrounding Donald Trump’s legal battles. Judge Juan Merchan in New York has ruled that Trump, despite being the president-elect, is not immune from sentencing for charges brought against him. This ruling refutes Trump’s legal team’s argument that his presidential immunity should delay or dismiss sentencing, stemming from 34 felony convictions related to business practices. Trump is required to appear in court on January 10, either in person or virtually, for sentencing. Mike Davis criticized Judge Merchan as biased, citing alleged political affiliations and connections to Democratic figures. Davis argued that the case is driven by partisan motives, aiming to tarnish Trump’s image before his inauguration. He highlighted procedural errors, such as breaches of presidential immunity, and labeled the charges as baseless. Bannon echoed Davis’s sentiments, portraying the legal proceedings as part of a broader campaign to undermine Trump and the MAGA movement. He emphasized the movement’s resilience and accused the establishment of attempting to prevent Trump’s return to power. Both expressed skepticism over the legal fairness of the process, forecasting appeals and further legal maneuvers by Trump’s team. Part One:  Part Two:  Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon delved into a complex web of incidents involving an individual with alleged connections to advanced technology and national security threats. Posobiec detailed the suspect’s erratic behavior, including reported infidelity, mental health issues, and a failed attempt to join Ukrainian brigades before returning to the U.S. The individual later conducted an attack and sent emails warning of leadership failures and threats to national security, which Posobiec highlighted as alarming yet unverified. The emails referenced advanced drone technology allegedly developed by the Chinese Communist Party, hinting at potential drone strikes from Chinese submarines along the Atlantic. Posobiec and Bannon discussed connections to Sequoia Capital and Elon Musk, speculating on the role of U.S. corporations in enabling such technology. They emphasized the need for heightened security measures, including drone jammers and geofencing of autonomous vehicles, particularly with the upcoming inauguration in mind. Bannon stressed the gravity of emerging threats, whether domestic or foreign, and the urgency for robust security preparations to mitigate potential attacks. Posobiec echoed these concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely intelligence sharing and proactive measures to prevent catastrophic incidents.  Natalie Winters talked about the negatives of the H-1B Visa program, including the general idea that the program is for bringing over talent that the United States citizen does not have.  Chris Fenton and others have raised concerns about the implications of educating international students, particularly from countries like China, at elite U.S. universities. They argue that this trend may disadvantage American students by taking spots that could otherwise go to domestic talent. Additionally, Chinese students are perceived as being under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), raising fears that their U.S. education and expertise could be weaponized against American interests or used to strengthen adversarial nations. Economic concerns also feature prominently, as international graduates often remain in the U.S., competing for jobs with Americans and exacerbating challenges for blue-collar and middle-class workers. Critics of the current system propose policies mandating that international students return to their home countries after graduation or limiting their admission at elite institutions to prioritize American citizens. They also highlight systemic issues in academia, such as universities relying on full-paying international students to fund tenured professors and administrative expenses, which is seen as prioritizing financial incentives over national interests. While the contributions of international students are acknowledged, the discussion emphasizes safeguarding American innovation and competitiveness, reflecting broader debates on immigration, education, and national security.  Steve Bannon and Brian Costello discussed alarming concerns about Chinese technology, specifically drones, and the implications of U.S. investment ties to China. Costello emphasized the involvement of American venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital, in funding Chinese companies aligned with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), enabling the development of advanced military technologies, including drones. They pointed to a tragic incident involving a veteran in Las Vegas, who reportedly took his life to highlight these issues. According to a manifesto linked to the event, the individual alleged that drones over U.S. airspace were of Chinese origin and increasingly aggressive, raising questions about national security and the risks of unchecked investment in China. The conversation delved into how some technologies, like those developed for consumer platforms such as TikTok, have dual-use applications, including military command systems. Bannon and Costello criticized the ongoing reluctance of U.S. policymakers to impose strict restrictions on outbound investments into China, calling this approach “asinine” given the CCP’s integration of civilian and military industries. They stressed the need for immediate congressional action and leadership change within U.S. security agencies to address these threats. Bannon also connected the discussion to broader political challenges, urging urgent reforms in intelligence and defense leadership. Highlighting the critical state of national security, he called for a more aggressive stance to protect American interests, signaling the importance of prioritizing this issue in upcoming discussions. The conversation underscored the urgency of addressing China’s technological and military advances.

Natalie Winters talked about the fires in California ad called into question the leadership of Gavin Newsom. Part One:  Part Two:  Mike Cernovich talked to Natalie Winters about the details of the fires in California and what he knew about people who lived in the area as well as the political problems in the state that may have increased the likelihood of the tragic fires.  Cernovich told Winters he felt that President Trump should consider a federal takeover the state.  In this discussion on Steve Bannon’s War Room, Mike Davis highlighted the contentious North Carolina Supreme Court race, where Democrat Allison Riggs claimed victory by 734 votes. Davis argued that 60,000 ballots cast without required voter identification—driver’s license numbers or Social Security digits—were illegitimate. He criticized Democratic operatives for attempting to certify these votes and praised the North Carolina Supreme Court for pausing certification to address the legality of these ballots. Davis implied that such issues point to broader concerns about voter integrity and potentially unlawful practices. Bannon and Davis linked this controversy to broader themes, such as the importance of judicial elections and the role of external organizations like Davis’s Article III Project. Davis urged War Room listeners to support President Trump’s agenda actively, particularly in securing qualified cabinet picks. He stressed the significance of grassroots mobilization and the War Room audience’s influence on political outcomes. Bannon echoed Davis’s sentiments, commending his past efforts in judicial confirmations and advocacy for election integrity. Together, they underscored the importance of vigilant action in safeguarding democracy and ensuring fair governance.  In their conversation, Jason Jones, currently in Turkey, discusses his mission with Steve Bannon on WarRoom. Jones explains that he is meeting with persecuted Christian and minority communities across the Middle East through his Vulnerable People Project, which has advocated for these groups since 2003. He highlights the ongoing genocide and decimation of ancient Christian communities in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon, urging Middle Eastern leaders to protect these vulnerable populations. Jones acknowledges Turkey’s strategic significance, despite its political complexities. He emphasizes Turkish President Erdoğan’s aspirations to re-establish the Ottoman Empire and its caliphate roots, underpinned by a resurgence of the Muslim Brotherhood. Bannon agrees, describing Turkey as a serious geopolitical force with a vision of regaining dominance over Islamic holy sites. Jones notes that the Middle East’s diversity is often misunderstood in the West and stresses the need for partnerships to preserve its ethnic and religious communities. He praises Bannon’s influence and thanks him for the platform to advocate for Christian minorities. The conversation also briefly touches on Jones’s article critiquing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s positions on international issues.  John Mills joined Steve Bannon on WarRoom to discuss the geopolitical tensions in South Korea and the region’s significance as a major U.S. ally. With 28,000 U.S. troops stationed there and critical military installations, Mills emphasizes the United States’ unwavering support for South Korea. Mills outlines escalating domestic and regional challenges. He highlights a power struggle in South Korea, where the Democratic Party is allegedly using unconstitutional tactics to consolidate power, including actions involving the National Election Commission. President Yoon Suk-yeol’s recent declaration of martial law, purportedly to address corruption, underscores the gravity of the situation. On the international front, North Korea’s recent mobilization of artillery from underground shelters into firing positions signals heightened tensions. Mills warns that the Chinese Communist Party might exploit the unrest to assert influence in the region. Bannon and Mills commend South Korea’s resilience and strong Christian heritage, emphasizing the need for vigilance and solidarity. Mills provides updates on social media platforms, promising ongoing coverage of the unfolding situation. The discussion underscores the strategic importance of South Korea in maintaining stability in East Asia amid growing threats from North Korea and China.

On Thursday evening’s WarRoom, Steve Bannon delivered a fiery critique of former President George W. Bush’s behavior at Jimmy Carter’s state funeral. Bannon highlighted Bush’s blatant snub of Donald Trump, walking past the former president without acknowledgment. In contrast, Bush leaned into Barack Obama with a jovial jab, which Bannon described as classless and disrespectful. Bannon criticized the Bush family and their allies for lacking integrity and responsibility, particularly over their role in national crises like the Iraq War, 9/11, and the 2008 financial collapse. He labeled Bush as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, second only to James Buchanan. Bannon also took aim at other establishment figures, including Karl Rove and Mike Pence, accusing them of spinelessness and betrayal of MAGA values. Bannon’s sharpest condemnation was reserved for the use of John Lennon’s Imagine—a song he called "atheistic” and "depraved”—at the National Cathedral during the funeral. He framed the moment as emblematic of the cultural decline MAGA seeks to reverse. Despite the slight to Trump, Bannon underscored that Trump’s focus remains on his mission to save the country, standing above the pettiness of his detractors. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly delved into critical updates on legal challenges facing Donald Trump, focusing on tomorrow’s scheduled sentencing in New York and developments in Florida regarding Jack Smith’s report. Bannon noted Judge Merchan’s likely prepared condemnation of Trump during sentencing, emphasizing the political underpinnings of the case. Kelly highlighted that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, overseeing an emergency stay application, has yet to act, raising concerns about potential partisan motivations. The discussion shifted to Jack Smith’s controversial draft report, intermingling classified documents and January 6 cases, which Trump’s legal team is trying to prevent from being publicized. The 11th Circuit granted Trump’s request to file an amicus brief, and Judge Cannon issued an order temporarily blocking the DOJ from sharing the report outside its ranks. Kelly explained that co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago case have requested further hearings, adding complexity to the legal battle. Bannon and Kelly criticized Jay Bratt, a former DOJ prosecutor tied to the Mar-a-Lago raid, accusing him of partisan motives and unethical practices. Bratt recently resigned after a controversial career. The conversation underscored the politicization of Trump’s legal challenges, the liberal judicial bias alleged by Kelly and Bannon, and the broader implications for 2024. Kelly concluded with updates on her platforms, promising real-time coverage as these pivotal events unfold. Both commentators framed the legal struggles as emblematic of ongoing political warfare targeting Trump and his allies.  Steve Bannon hosted Texas Republican Party Chairman Abraham George to discuss key political tensions in Texas, particularly the House Speaker’s race and its implications for conservative governance. They highlighted grassroots MAGA supporters’ significant contributions in securing Republican victories, emphasizing Texas as a stronghold for the movement. The conversation turned to George W. Bush’s perceived snub of Donald Trump at the National Cathedral, which George criticized as disrespectful, especially in Trump-supporting Texas. The discussion delved into longstanding issues with Texas House leadership. George explained that moderate Republicans have historically aligned with Democrats to select the Speaker, granting Democrats influential committee positions that hinder conservative legislation. He noted grassroots efforts demanding the Speaker be chosen solely by Republican caucus members to advance the party’s priorities. Bannon and George emphasized the immense power of the Texas House Speaker, who controls critical legislative outcomes. While George outlined grassroots strategies to address the problem, the conversation was cut short, leaving the solution incomplete. Bannon underscored the stakes, portraying the situation as a microcosm of broader political battles, including resistance against the Bush political apparatus and establishment forces undermining MAGA’s agenda.  Natalie Winters talked about the failures of Gavin Newsome and the Democrats in California that led up to a disastrous result with the most recent fire damage to property.  Jeremy Kauffman argues that the left denies reality and then becomes angry when the consequences emerge. He highlights this in several areas, including diversity initiatives, forest management, and insurance markets, particularly in California. Kauffman criticizes policies that ignore merit, such as prioritizing inclusivity over competence in critical roles like firefighting, leading to predictable adverse outcomes. On the insurance market, Kauffman points out that California’s law restricting insurers to using only historical data for pricing prevents them from accounting for future risks, like increasing wildfire threats. As a result, insurers, unable to charge appropriate premiums for high-risk areas like the Palisades, dropped thousands of homeowners, as insurance is a business and not a charity. Kauffman also criticizes environmental policies that prevent effective forest management, leading to a buildup of fire risks. He predicts that California politicians will scapegoat insurance companies, demand bailouts, and impose further regulations instead of addressing the root causes, perpetuating a cycle of denial and failure.  Savanah Hernandez highlights California’s severe wildfire crisis and the state government’s failures in fire prevention and response. During her visit to San Diego, she witnessed homeless encampments as sources of fires, which often grow into massive, destructive blazes. She then traveled to Altadena, where residents faced devastating fires without sufficient firefighter presence or preparation despite prior warnings about strong winds. One resident recounted watching fires rage for over an hour before evacuating, with no fire crews or helicopters responding due to the winds. Many locals resorted to protecting their homes with personal sprinklers and hoses. In one case, a woman was blocked by police from delivering fire hoses to her property. Hernandez criticized California’s outdated infrastructure, noting no new water reservoirs have been built since the 1980s. She also pointed to government negligence, such as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass being abroad during citywide evacuations, and the lack of forest and fire management. Hernandez highlighted frustrations among residents paying high taxes but receiving little help. Many suspect some fires were intentionally set, and she emphasized the role of homelessness in contributing to fires, exposing systemic mismanagement and misplaced priorities in the state.  Natalie Winters talked about the likelihood that Lawfare is not going to simply go away when President Trump gets back to the White House, as Jack Smith and Judge Merchan are attempting to box Trump in, and label him a felon, before the 20th when Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president of the US.

WarRoom panel discussions, on the day of President Trump’s historic inauguration, blended political commentary, real-time updates, and historical reflection. With Trump’s motorcade en route to the Capitol, the broadcast provided an intimate look at the unfolding events and their broader implications. As President Trump headed to the Rotunda for a ceremony unprecedented since Reagan’s second inauguration, panelists celebrated the grandeur of the day. They highlighted the symbolic importance of the event, emphasizing unity through the mandate given by the American electorate in November 2024. Trump’s upcoming inaugural address was anticipated to focus on "sunlit uplands,” a vision for a reinvigorated nation after recent political turbulence. The discussions also delved into logistical challenges, including heightened security measures attributed to concerns over potential clashes between Antifa and right-wing groups. Analysts criticized what they perceived as the administrative state’s effort to diminish the event’s visibility, reflecting broader resistance to Trump’s leadership. Historical comparisons were drawn to past confrontations with Antifa, noting the violent protests at the 2017 "Deploraball.” Panelists lauded the day as a testament to the resilience of Trump’s movement, symbolized by a diverse crowd of MAGA supporters braving the elements to celebrate. Commentators like John Solomon dissected the intelligence state’s role in framing security concerns, asserting that such narratives aimed to minimize public participation and sow doubt about Trump’s legitimacy. Amid the pageantry, attention shifted to Trump’s imminent actions as president. His plans to issue nearly 100 executive orders were framed as a bold assertion of authority to counter resistance from entrenched bureaucracies. This aggressive policy agenda was heralded as the dawn of a transformative era. Historical and architectural references enriched the commentary, from the "brutalist” FBI headquarters symbolizing institutional decay to the Vatican-inspired artistry of the Capitol Dome. Such allusions underscored the day’s significance as a confluence of tradition and renewal. Ultimately, the panel projected optimism about Trump’s potential to unify the nation, despite ongoing opposition. As the motorcade arrived, commentators rallied viewers to witness a pivotal moment in American history, marked by the enduring spirit of democracy and the promise of change.

Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the inadequate response to natural disasters in Appalachia, including areas of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Bergquam highlighted the struggles of hurricane survivors who have been living in tents during harsh winters due to FEMA’s slow and ineffective response. While FEMA provided some hotel vouchers and assistance, much of the relief effort came from donations and grassroots organizations, as government aid fell short. Bergquam expressed frustration with bureaucratic red tape, stating, “I’ll ask for forgiveness before I ask for permission,” emphasizing the need to bypass ineffective systems to help those in need. Bergquam criticized the Biden administration for neglecting American citizens while prioritizing aid for illegal immigrants. He reported from a Chicago hotel where newly arrived migrants received warm accommodations, meals, cash cards, and other benefits, contrasting it with the dire conditions faced by hurricane survivors in Appalachia. Bergquam accused the administration of orchestrating what he called a “highly organized invasion” that prioritized migrants over U.S. citizens. He emphasized that communities in Appalachia had to rely on their own efforts, such as grassroots groups like the Appalachian United Initiative, to provide relief and rebuild. Bannon and Bergquam also discussed the broader political implications, tying the Biden administration’s policies to the suffering of Americans in neglected regions. They noted that President Trump had prioritized these areas by visiting North Carolina and showing support for disaster-stricken communities. Bergquam asserted that Trump’s leadership marked the end of neglect and a renewed focus on putting Americans first. The segment emphasized the stark divide between grassroots resilience and perceived government failures under the current administration.  Ben Bergquam and Brian Glenn join Steve Bannon to talk about what they expect from the press event with President Trump in North Carolina.  Glenn and Bannon add commentary and exclusive video footage of Trump’s comments at the airport and at the following gathering with North Carolina officials.  President Trump, speaking in North Carolina, criticized FEMA for its inefficiency in disaster recovery, pledging to expedite relief efforts and suggesting states should handle such crises directly for faster, more cost-effective results. He contrasted this with California, highlighting severe mismanagement of water resources and calling for policies to restore water to farmlands and cities. On the Ukraine conflict, Trump described the war as tragic and avoidable, asserting it would not have occurred under his leadership and suggesting that lowering oil prices could pressure Russia to end the war. He emphasized his “America First” agenda, advocating for voter ID laws, addressing sanctuary city policies, and prioritizing domestic issues like disaster recovery and resource management to support states and ensure election integrity.  President Trump criticized FEMA for its inadequate response to North Carolina’s disaster recovery, citing bureaucratic inefficiency, slow action, and high costs. He highlighted severe water and wind damage across the state, emphasizing the devastating impact on communities, including Asheville, which went without running water for two months. Trump pledged to take strong action to expedite relief efforts, proposing reforms or potentially dismantling FEMA to allow states to manage disaster recovery directly. He argued that states, being familiar with local needs, are better equipped to handle such crises effectively. Trump expressed gratitude for the support he received during his campaign from North Carolina and commended individuals like Michael Watley, Franklin Graham, and local representatives for their contributions to recovery efforts. He acknowledged the extensive damage caused by the disaster, including 104 fatalities and the destruction of over 73,000 homes, calling it one of the worst crises he had seen. To accelerate recovery, Trump announced plans to involve the Army Corps of Engineers to address river breaks and infrastructure issues. He assured residents that North Carolina would rebuild stronger and better, highlighting his commitment to supporting the state. Trump’s remarks underscored his dissatisfaction with FEMA and his vision for a more efficient, state-led approach to disaster recovery.

Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam’s discussion highlights the challenges of deporting illegal immigrants from sanctuary cities like Chicago, where local and state officials refuse to cooperate with ICE. Bannon referenced past successes under Trump, urging immediate action to address Central American countries’ responses and Columbia’s ongoing negotiations. Bergquam, reporting from Chicago, described the obstacles ICE faces in deporting criminal aliens due to state and city policies that block ICE detainers. These policies force ICE to track down dangerous individuals in communities, creating risks for agents and the public. Bannon criticized officials like Chicago’s mayor and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for enabling lawlessness by releasing criminal aliens back into communities. Bergquam noted that ICE agents were shocked by the severity of the situation, with hundreds of detainees being held but not released to ICE. Both predicted federal actions, including potential defunding of sanctuary cities, as a response. Bannon called for stronger enforcement and a crackdown on uncooperative officials, arguing that public safety and national security demand immediate action. Bergquam shared firsthand experiences of ICE operations, highlighting bureaucratic hurdles and the urgent need for systemic reform to address what they see as deliberate obstruction of immigration enforcement. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the ongoing detention of Tyler Burleson, who remains in Unicoi County Jail without being arraigned for over a week. Burleson, allegedly held on to an insufficient check charge, revealed that the business involved wasn’t pressing charges and that the check was resolved before his arrest. He claims his detention stems from local authorities targeting him, notably after he opened a community distribution center without seeking permission. Burleson accused Detective Tony Buchanan and D.A. Justin Iraq of unjust actions, alleging personal bias and a deliberate effort to keep him jailed. He also stated that Mayor Glenn White opposed the distribution center, reflecting tensions between his efforts to aid the community and local government officials. Burleson expressed frustration at being cut off from outside communication and having limited access to visitation or updates. Bannon pledged to investigate the situation and spotlight the authorities involved, suggesting political motivations behind the arrest. The conversation emphasized Burleson’s belief that his detention is an attempt to suppress his work and keep him from supporting President Trump during his recent visit to the region. Bannon and Bergquam vowed to seek justice and accountability.  Eli Crane joined Steve Bannon to discuss the reconciliation process and its challenges. Crane expressed concern over the Republican conference’s preference for a single comprehensive bill, which he believes is risky and inefficient. He emphasized the need for immediate wins, mainly to fund Tom Homan and border security efforts, as delays could lead to more American lives being lost due to illegal immigration. Crane highlighted the logistical difficulties of passing a single massive bill, which would allow the mainstream media to push anti-deportation narratives, weaken moderate Republicans, and stall meaningful border security and deportation measures. Bannon supported Crane’s argument, pointing out that the complexity of a hefty bill would delay progress until mid-2024, leaving immigration reform vulnerable to opposition from the media, deep state, and administrative state. He criticized the lack of preparation for a two-bill approach and warned that the one-bill strategy would give adversaries time to undermine Trump’s immigration agenda. Crane and Bannon agreed that the deep state and administrative state are actively resisting Trump’s plans, including funding for deportation efforts. They noted that ICE agents could become targets of media campaigns designed to generate emotional backlash, which would pressure moderate Republicans to withdraw support. Additionally, Crane addressed the broader fiscal challenges, including looming government shutdowns and deficits. He criticized proposals like the Freedom Caucus’ plan to increase the debt ceiling by $4 trillion over two years, signaling two trillion-dollar annual deficits. Both Crane and Bannon stressed the importance of Republicans standing firm on fiscal discipline while ensuring Trump receives the resources necessary for border security and deportations.  Mercedes Schlapp joined Steve Bannon on War Room to emphasize the importance of the upcoming CPAC conference at National Harbor. Schlapp described CPAC as the premier gathering for conservatives, offering Americans and international leaders a platform to unite, strategize, and celebrate President Trump’s victories. Schlapp highlighted CPAC’s global reach, noting its influence in countries like Argentina, Japan, Brazil, and Australia, where it supports conservative movements against communism and globalism. She explained how these nations are inspired by Trump’s leadership and seek to replicate his America First policies in their own regions. This year’s CPAC theme, "America is Winning,” is about the urgency of implementing Trump’s agenda quickly. Schlapp stressed that conservatives must stay focused and act decisively to overcome opposition from legacy media and reorganize Democrats. With tickets priced at $76 using the promo code "WarRoom,” CPAC aims to attract a massive turnout. Schlapp called it a chance to celebrate victories and prepare for upcoming battles at the local, state, and federal levels. She encouraged all patriots to join this critical event and play a role in shaping the future.  Steve Bannon and Marc Beckman, an NYU professor and author on AI, discussed the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and its implications. Bannon expressed skepticism about the growing influence of Chinese technology, particularly DeepSeek, a new AI app gaining popularity in the U.S. He warned that, like TikTok, it could collect massive amounts of data from users, raising concerns about privacy and security. Beckman acknowledged these risks but pointed out that DeepSeek is a sophisticated tool, and the Chinese government’s investment in AI could outpace U.S. efforts. He also highlighted the growing use of AI in cyber attacks, particularly from China, targeting U.S. infrastructure. While Beckman expressed optimism about AI’s potential, especially in fields like fashion, finance, and military, he also shared concerns about its dangers, such as privacy violations and the increasing use of facial recognition technology. His book, Some Future Day, aims to help readers leverage AI for career advancement but also addresses these risks. Bannon, ever cautious, questioned the long-term effects of letting foreign powers control such technology. Beckman also discussed the real-world applications of AI, noting its growing presence in various industries while emphasizing the need for safe, responsible development.   Joe Allen and Steve Bannon discuss the intersection of technology, AI, and the future of global power, focusing on the potential threat China poses. Allen acknowledges the complex nature of the situation, describing the recent rise of the Chinese company DeepSeek’s AI model, which has been open-sourced and quickly adopted by American users, resulting in sensitive data being sent to Chinese servers. Bannon warns that this represents a significant challenge to American tech dominance compared to TikTok’s impact. The conversation turns to the energy demands of AI, particularly regarding large-scale models, and the shift in priorities where the focus has moved away from climate change to securing massive energy supplies to drive technological advances. Allen and Bannon agree that this moment is a hybrid of a "Sputnik moment” and a psyop, with China leveraging its AI advancements to assert dominance while manipulating global perceptions. They also discuss the accelerating race to develop AI, spurred by competition between U.S. and Chinese tech leaders. While some American tech figures push for rapid AI development, the conversation reflects deep concerns over data security, the broader geopolitical struggle, and the potential societal consequences of AI’s unchecked growth.  Steve Bannon and Maureen Bannon discuss exciting details about upcoming events, including the CPAC conference and the Force Multiplier Academy, which will take place at the Gaylord National Harbor on February 19. Steve invites War Room Posse members to attend, offering an exclusive discounted CPAC ticket at $76 (normally $95). To attend the Force Multiplier Academy, attendees must have a valid CPAC ticket. The academy promises impactful speakers and sessions, with updates on room details to be shared soon. Steve encourages participation, highlighting the presence of key speakers and War Room’s active role in the event. They also mention Real America’s Voice, which will provide extensive coverage, including appearances by notable figures like John Solomon and Natalie Winters. Steve shares the ambition of making the event accessible and encourages the audience to attend both CPAC and the Force Multiplier Academy. He also emphasizes the importance of supporting War Room by sharing content, signing up for free resources, and engaging with sponsors, whom they’ve chosen for their valuable information and relationship-building. Steve reiterates War Room’s commitment to remaining free of paywalls and making content widely available to reach the American public. He concludes by urging listeners to secure their CPAC tickets via cpac.org and register for the Force Multiplier Academy at the provided event link.

Steve Bannon emphasized that Trump campaigned to hold his enemies accountable, and his supporters backed that vision. He criticized DOJ staff tied to January 6th cases, claiming they’re being targeted for removal despite civil service protections. Bannon highlighted Trump’s aggressive actions to overhaul agencies like the FDIC, which ensures bank deposits, framing it as part of the MAGA agenda. Bannon criticized mainstream media like CNN, calling them irrelevant, and slammed officials like Greg Abbott for performative leadership on border issues. He called for mass deportations, stating all 12-15 million illegal immigrants must leave to restore the community and protect resources for working-class Americans. He insisted this effort should be firm but empathetic, emphasizing no debate. Bannon praised Trump’s idea to send repeat criminals to foreign prisons, believing it would reduce crime. He also supported Trump’s broader moves, from deploying troops to revamping agencies, and lauded figures like Kristi Noem for bold actions. Bannon urged MAGA supporters to stay focused on the larger mission of systemic reform, criticizing overselling of immediate victories and calling for a long-term commitment to the movement’s goals. His tone remained defiant, framing MAGA as unstoppable and essential for saving America.  Steve Bannon interviewed Raheem Kassam about the culture of MAGA and his new restaurant venture in Washington, DC.  Steve Bannon dives deep into the relationship between Obama, Biden, Wall Street, and Big Tech. He calls Obama and Biden “reactionary” presidents, masking their actions as “progressive” through performative optics. Bannon claims Obama made a deal with Silicon Valley at a San Francisco airport, empowering platforms like Facebook to crush the Clintons and establish monopolistic power. This marked a shift from capitalism to a system of monopolies and rent-seeking, dominated by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Bannon highlights how Wall Street and Silicon Valley created an oligarchy, abandoning ordinary Americans. He points to the 2008 financial bailout as a moment when elites saved themselves while leaving the little guy to suffer. This fueled a populist backlash that led to Trump’s 2016 victory. Big Tech, according to Bannon, now suppresses dissent, ensuring their platforms push progressive agendas while silencing voices like Breitbart. He argues that the age of the algorithm, dominated by Silicon Valley, has stifled true innovation. Meanwhile, China’s TikTok and AI advancements have outpaced the U.S., leaving the country vulnerable. Bannon’s core message: the elites sold out the American people, creating monopolies and abandoning traditional values for their gain.  Steve Bannon talked to Natalie Winters from the White House.  Steve Bannon and Frank Gaffney discussed the growing challenges in the Middle East. They focused on the actions of Turkey, Iran, and Qatar. Bannon warned about Turkey’s push to revive the Ottoman Empire under Erdogan, calling him aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. He urged the U.S. to label the group a terrorist organization. Bannon stressed the importance of addressing radical Islamic supremacism. But he cautioned against rushing into unnecessary wars. He believes the U.S. needs a clear strategy that avoids looking weak or reckless. Gaffney praised Bannon’s efforts to expose these threats. He mentioned Trump’s 2016 agenda to fight “radical Islamic terrorism” through strength and decisive action. Gaffney introduced resources like VictoryCo.org and GateStone Institute to help educate the public on these issues. Both agreed that the U.S. must stay focused on its interests. They emphasized balancing restraint with strength. For them, the key is understanding the region’s players and their ambitions.

Sen. Rand Paul praises Kennedy as a disruptor in this segment, which is necessary because public health has been mismanaged for years, citing the misleading food pyramid as an example he said. He highlights Kennedy’s breadth of knowledge and his advocacy for transparency and open discussion about medical risks and benefits, especially concerning the COVID-19 vaccine. Paul criticizes the government for not being honest about the vaccine’s risks versus benefits for different age groups, suggesting that the advice given was not tailored to individual risk levels. He points out that the government’s approach, including mandates, misinformation on masks, and social distancing, has led to public distrust. Steve Bannon questions if the misinformation was intentional. Paul responds by suggesting that authorities knew the truth but chose to mislead the public under the guise of a ‘noble lie’, thinking it would benefit society. The conversation shifts to strategies for tackling the influence of Big Pharma. Paul suggests separating pharmaceutical companies from their regulatory influence, using the example of government and pharmaceutical companies sharing patents on the mRNA vaccine. He argues for better transparency to restore trust in government health advice. The discussion ends with Paul promising continued scrutiny over figures like Anthony Fauci, particularly regarding the virus’s origins and the handling of related research, indicating ongoing investigations and a commitment to transparency.  Robert F. Kennedy appeared before a Senate hearing for his nomination by President Trump for Health secretary.  Megyn Kelly joined Steve Bannon to discuss Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s (RFK Jr.) performance at his Senate confirmation hearing. Kelly noted that although the hearing was tough, RFK Jr. handled the situation well despite the aggressive questioning. She remarked that Senator Cassidy particularly challenged him on issues like Medicare and Medicaid, where technical questions were used to make him appear unprepared potentially. However, she felt that RFK Jr. managed to articulate his positions, especially on environmental toxins, which Trump selected him to address. Kelly defended RFK Jr. against accusations of being anti-vaccine, clarifying that he does not advocate for banning vaccines but opposes mandatory vaccinations. She and Bannon then discussed the broader implications of RFK Jr.’s nomination, highlighting the opposition from influential figures like Elizabeth Warren, whom they accused of being financially tied to Big Pharma. Bannon and Kelly also touched on the strategies RFK Jr. could use in future hearings, suggesting he should be more aggressive and capitalize on his strengths, like his litigation experience and knowledge of environmental issues. They emphasized the importance of his nomination in fighting against the influence of Big Pharma, expressing concerns about corruption within regulatory bodies like the FDA. The conversation also veered into personal anecdotes about RFK Jr., including his family dynamics and public persona, with Kelly mentioning his vocal cord issues, which sometimes affected his speaking capabilities. They concluded by discussing the political strategy President Trump should employ to ensure RFK Jr.’s confirmation, suggesting Trump should actively whip votes to support his nominee, given the significance of RFK Jr.’s role in addressing health and environmental issues. The dialogue was punctuated by their mutual support for RFK Jr., despite acknowledging his eccentricities and a shared skepticism of the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over politics and health policy. Part One:  Part Two:  Brian Glenn and Steve Bannon discussed the recent OMB memo, its media reception, and broader political strategies. Bannon noted that the memo, while standard, triggered a firestorm from the left. Glenn highlighted Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt’s firm response, dismissing media narratives about funding cuts to critical programs, reinforcing her no-nonsense approach. Bannon questioned whether the administration showed weakness, but Glenn assured that Trump’s team remains aggressive, with daily briefings from either Leavitt or Trump himself. Glenn also noted that experienced White House reporters had never seen such direct responses from an administration. Looking ahead, they emphasized the urgency of aligning the House with Trump’s agenda, as policy battles over debt, deficits, and taxes loom. Bannon stressed that process—not just policy—is crucial, given constitutional constraints on spending. Trump’s actions, including moves on immigration and reallocating unspent Green New Deal funds, were framed as bold, demonstrating executive authority. Glenn highlighted Trump’s direct approach with foreign governments on deportation, reinforcing his tough stance. Bannon concluded that Trump is "winning everywhere” but warned against strategic missteps that could hand the opposition a rallying point. He emphasized that this is a "testing period” for aggressive governance, urging continued momentum without hesitation.  Steve Bannon talked about the action steps needed to help secure the nomination of President Trump.  Mary Holland talked about the MAHA movement of supporters behind Robert Kennedy Jr.  Kari Lake talked to Steve Bannon about the “mama bear” movement behind Robert Kennedy Jr and why she supports his nomination.  Lake also shared the perspective of the Moms who feel betrayed by the food and medical industry.  Lake thought he Kennedy did very well and predicted he will be nominated.  Natalie WInters gave a live report from the White House.  Jim Rickards talked about President Trump’s numerous executive actions since getting sworn in.  Steve Bannon talked to George Papadopoulos and his wife, Simona Mangiante about their new podcast.

President Trump had a press conference and spoke for about 35 min. Dealing the details he had about the American Airlines crash on Wednesday night at Regan Airport.  Mary Holland and Steve Bannon discussed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s performance in his confirmation hearings, emphasizing the political and corporate resistance he faces, particularly from the pharmaceutical industry. Bannon noted that Kennedy was subjected to tough, brutal questioning, but he held his own. The hearings were not just about approval but about limiting Kennedy’s options if he were to advance. Holland highlighted the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over Congress and its hostility toward Kennedy, whom they see as a threat due to his push for transparency and independent scientific scrutiny. She described the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement as a growing political force, particularly among mothers advocating for health reforms. They also discussed Senator Bill Cassidy’s pivotal role in the Finance Committee vote, stressing the importance of grassroots pressure to secure Kennedy’s confirmation. While Cassidy adheres to mainstream medical narratives, Holland believes he is persuadable. Bannon and Holland agreed that Kennedy’s approach—focusing on transparency and gold-standard science—aligns with Trump’s vision and resonates with a broad audience. They underscored the movement’s long-term significance, framing it as a historic grassroots uprising that politicians cannot ignore without political consequences.

They underscored the movement’s long-term significance, framing it as a historic grassroots uprising that politicians cannot ignore without political consequences.  Naomi Wolf and Steve Bannon discussed the intense scrutiny and attacks RFK Jr. faced, particularly regarding vaccines and public health policies. Wolf framed the moment as a pivotal test, where political and corporate elites sought to derail him. She described the hearings as revealing a desperate, almost ritualistic opposition from Democratic senators, who seemed to be defending pharmaceutical interests at all costs rather than engaging in scientific debate. Bannon emphasized the aggressive tactics used against RFK Jr., noting the same hostility had been directed at other populist figures like Trump, Matt Gaetz, and Tulsi Gabbard. The conversation suggested the hearings were more than political theater—they exposed a deep ideological divide, where RFK Jr. stood as a lone voice against entrenched interests. Wolf noted that while RFK Jr. delivered a solid performance, the real victory lay in how the opposition revealed itself. Senators who attacked him appeared emotionally unhinged, dogmatic, and unwilling to address concerns about chronic disease and corporate influence over public health. Bannon and Wolf agreed that this moment should be leveraged by RFK Jr.’s and Trump’s teams to highlight the establishment’s irrational resistance to questioning pharmaceutical narratives. Ultimately, Wolf viewed RFK Jr.’s resilience as a spiritual battle, comparing his unwavering commitment to truth with Trump’s. She concluded that the hearings weren’t just about RFK Jr.—they exposed the broader struggle between populist truth-tellers and the institutional forces trying to silence them.  Steve Bannon and Jim Rickards discussed the recent attacks on Tulsi Gabbard during her confirmation hearing, highlighting her composed demeanor and ability to handle adversarial questioning. Rickards praised Gabbard for not falling into “gotcha” traps and emphasized that her meeting with Bashar al-Assad was a standard intelligence-gathering move rather than an endorsement. They noted that the smear tactics used against her mirrored past Democratic strategies, branding dissenters as “Russian assets” for challenging the Ukraine war narrative. Rickards asserted that Gabbard’s stance on Ukraine aligns more with reality than the mainstream U.S. intelligence community, which he accused of distorting facts to shape policy. He argued that Putin’s strategic assessment of the war is largely correct, while U.S. agencies continue to push Ukrainian propaganda. The discussion also touched on Section 702 surveillance abuses, with Gabbard advocating for reforms to prevent warrantless spying on Americans. Bannon and Rickards agreed that the intelligence community has failed at its core mission—collecting accurate intelligence—while excelling at manipulating policy decisions. They concluded that the deep state, through inter-agency influence, has overstepped its role, and a reformed approach to intelligence is necessary to restore credibility.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the ongoing confirmation hearings for key Trump nominees, analyzing media reactions and political implications. Winters noted that while figures like Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel had strong showings, media coverage seemed less panicked about RFK Jr., suggesting they may see his nomination as unlikely. She also highlighted how mainstream outlets are strategically avoiding outrage over nominees to prevent giving Republicans an advantage. Bannon pointed out how the press couldn’t resist reacting to Trump’s press conference, where he criticized “woke” hiring policies, particularly in aviation. He cited reports of a diversity-hired helicopter pilot with limited experience, arguing that such policies lead to incompetence. Winters emphasized the urgency of confirming Trump’s nominees to counteract what she described as the Biden administration’s failures. The conversation then shifted to immigration, where Winters highlighted lawsuits to block mass deportations, particularly those backed by groups like the ACLU. She criticized these efforts as taxpayer-funded resistance against enforcing immigration laws. The segment concluded with a mention of Daily Mail’s coverage of political and cultural issues, reinforcing the idea that media narratives play a crucial role in shaping public perception.

Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon discussed the details of Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation hearing.  Kassam Raheem talked to Steve Bannon about the breaking details of the news that President Trump had fired some FBI agents.  Julie Kelly and Steve Bannon discuss a major shakeup within the FBI and DOJ, describing it as a long-overdue purge of entrenched bureaucrats obstructing reform. Kelly highlights how DOJ officials were in shock after Trump’s victory, knowing their actions would come under scrutiny. She mentions that Kash Patel will play a key role in investigating and holding corrupt officials accountable, now facing fewer barriers in accessing critical evidence. They expect fierce pushback, with critics framing these actions as retaliation against career civil servants, but argue the real goal is to restore integrity by removing political bias. Kelly also discusses broader DOJ reforms, including a new focus on actual national security threats instead of politically driven prosecutions. She highlights efforts to reassign corrupt prosecutors to neutral roles, forcing some to resign rather than enforce immigration laws. Additionally, an internal inquiry has been launched into controversial charges used against January 6 defendants, particularly after a Supreme Court ruling reversed key legal precedents. The restructuring extends to federal attorneys, with new leadership prioritizing immigration enforcement. Kelly emphasizes that these moves mark a major step toward dismantling corruption within the DOJ and FBI, with more changes expected soon.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon discussed major economic and political shifts under a potential second Trump presidency. Patrick emphasized tariffs as a tool to balance trade deficits, suggesting a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, generating up to $820 billion annually. However, he acknowledged tariffs raise consumer prices and can trigger retaliatory measures, as seen in 2016, which impacted American farmers. Despite these drawbacks, tariffs have spurred U.S. manufacturing, with factory construction rising 250% since Trump’s initial tariffs on China. Patrick warned that tariffs alone wouldn’t close the deficit and that deficit spending remains a challenge.  Steve Bannon and Mike Davis discussed the critical need for conservative action in judicial confirmations and government spending. Davis emphasized mobilizing citizens to pressure senators into confirming President Trump’s cabinet picks, warning against GOP obstruction. Bannon reinforced that MAGA supporters will not tolerate resistance from Senate Republicans.  Natalie Winters gave her report from the White House.

HIGHLIGHTS: Wednesday’s show explored MSNBC’s turmoil over Ronna McDaniels’s brief tenure and the rescinding of Rhonda Romney McDaniel’s hiring, inciting reactions from Universal News Group staff.  Host Steve Bannon dissected Trump’s appeal to working-class Democrats and the establishment’s backlash. Discussions also touched on immigration’s impact on housing and the pushback against EV regulations, highlighting ongoing political battles. From concerns over illegal immigrant housing to strategies for the 2024 election, the show offered a panoramic view of America’s political landscape. As Bannon emphasized the need for grassroots resistance, guests like Louis Murray and Catherine O’Neill brought local activism and entrepreneurial spirit to the forefront, reflecting diverse perspectives. Natalie Winters and Brittany Martinez discussed Evie Magazine’s scrutiny over birth control side effects, attributing it to political agendas and censorship and she spoke with Dave Walsh about energy policies Americans need to focus on. Full show in segments: Wednesday’s night show opened with a clip of MSNBC talking heads discussing the devolution of Ronna McDaniels’s employment at the network, lasting less than two days, without fury raging through the MSNBC crew.  The show opens with a discussion about a memo circulated within Universal News Group, authored by Conde, announcing the rescinding of Rhonda Romney McDaniel’s hiring, causing solid reactions among employees, including Joe Ried and Rachel Madow. MSNBC’s Charlie Sykes appeared in the clip, highlighting the establishment’s opposition to Trump, rallying behind Biden, while working-class Democrats are embracing Trump’s disruptive message, as Bannon pointed out. Bannon said voters would focus on the convergence of crises, referring to US southern border issues, federal spending, and geopolitical tensions, adding that those issues would fuel the working class’s support for Trump. Bannon talked about how the establishment, symbolized by figures like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, faces rejection by the new Republican base. The establishment’s strategy, underscored by recent efforts in Ukraine, relies on unconventional methods, potentially involving legal maneuvers orchestrated by Obama-era officials. Bannon pointed to reports that suggest Obama’s direct involvement in White House affairs, indicating a concerted effort to counter Trump’s resurgence, with Matthew Calandra playing a pivotal role. This intricate web of political maneuvering underscores the ongoing power struggle within the Republican Party and the broader political landscape.  Outside the Massachusetts State Capitol, as Bannon interviewed him, a group of about 25 individuals, including Lou Murray, is taking an early lunch break amid concerns over the state budget. Layoffs of teachers are imminent in four primary school systems. At the same time, the government plans to allocate an additional two billion dollars towards housing illegal immigrants in hotels, exploiting the state’s right-to-shelter policy. According to recent statistics, the immigration influx, numbering around 288,000, exacerbates the existing housing crisis and strains public resources. Residents who witness their tax dollars being funneled into providing free services for immigrants while essential community resources suffer grow dissatisfied. Murray discussed concerns that community centers are being displaced from urban areas to affluent suburbs. However, Murray told Bannon that efforts to raise awareness and mobilize action face challenges, including the co-optation of activists and community leaders. Murray said Governor Moore Healy’s recent announcement of tolls on commuters crossing the Cape Cod Canal adds to the economic burdens of blue-collar workers traveling to Boston for employment. Despite these challenges, grassroots activism persists, with individuals like Murray advocating for change and utilizing social media platforms like Twitter to amplify their voices and engage with the broader community.  In the following segment, Bannon said the opposition’s strategy revolves around allocating two billion dollars to challenge Trump in battleground states, focusing on 25 critical counties. Biden intends to leverage administrative power, including the deep state and a massive propaganda machine, to sway public opinion. Despite missed opportunities, such as not utilizing Danielle Pletka effectively, aiming to delegitimize Biden’s presidency, recognizing growing discontent among Americans, particularly regarding immigration policies and the southern border crisis. The media is a vital tool in propaganda efforts, controlled by powerful interests in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and corporate elites. However, Bannon says, grassroots movements continue to resist, emphasizing the rigged nature of the political system and the need for accountability. Bannon anticipates turbulent times ahead but remains committed to exposing and confronting the corruption within the establishment.  Bannon talked about the frustration with the situation in New York around Trump’s lawfare cases and added the dangers posed by illegal immigration, citing a case where an illegal immigrant on TikTok instructed others on how to squat in the country. Bannon criticizes the Biden administration’s handling of immigration issues, seeing it as part of a broader effort to transform America. Despite recognizing Trump’s efforts, he stressed the need for collective action and volunteerism to counter the opposition’s tactics, which include legal maneuvers and propaganda. Bannon argued that Trump’s policies are vital for restoring America’s prosperity and security, contrasting them with what they perceive as the opposition’s nostalgia trap. The speaker emphasizes resilience in the face of challenges and vows to continue fighting against perceived injustices and corruption within the establishment.  Mike Davis talked about the judge overseeing Trump’s financial case who has issued a gag order following Trump’s public statements, deeming them threatening and inflammatory. The judge expressed concern about potential witness intimidation. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Obama is exerting influence over Biden’s administration, aiming to prosecute Trump. Matthew Colangelo, from the Biden Justice Department, is tasked with leading the case against Trump, which some see as politically motivated. The prosecution aims to vilify Trump, focusing on issues related to women and portraying him as a misogynist. Critics argue that this case infringes on Trump’s First Amendment and due process rights and suspect a broader conspiracy against Trump. Despite skepticism, the speaker believes that Trump’s resilience will prevail, and they call for continued advocacy to support Trump’s cause.  Despite Donald Trump’s apparent control over the Republican Party and its grassroots support, there is notable dissent within the party’s ranks, particularly among prominent figures like senators and former party leaders. Many senators, including Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney, have publicly stated their refusal to support Trump’s bid for re-election. This level of opposition from within the party is unprecedented in American history, with only Sarah Palin among recent Republican nominees publicly supporting Trump. In the clip Bannon shows, there is a suggestion that Trump’s control of the party may not be as absolute as it seems, pointing to these cracks in his support.  Catherine O’Neill, a former White House and State Department member, joins the discussion with Bannon. She expresses her commitment to fighting for clean and healthy food supplies amid challenges from large food corporations promoting radical environmentalism. She highlights her company, Meriweather Farms, based in Wyoming, which offers high-quality beef products. O’Neill emphasizes their dedication to providing various affordable options and encourages people to visit their website, www.maryweatherfarms.com, to learn more and place orders. Steve Bannon praises her entrepreneurial spirit and encourages listeners to support her efforts.  Steve Bannon discusses the strategies opponents employ to undermine Trump’s influence and the upcoming joint efforts of the Democratic Party, led by Obama, to counter Trump’s expanding coalition. He highlights concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election and criticizes Jim Jordan’s response to questions about it. Bannon emphasizes the importance of defending the constitutional republic and restoring stability and prosperity under Trump’s leadership. He concludes by expressing pride in the individuals and brands aligned with Trump’s cause.  Steve Bannon and Joshua Philipp discuss developments regarding illegal immigration and squatter rights in the United States. They highlight a video where an individual advocates for stealing homes from Americans and discusses the implications of squatter rights laws. Philipp explains the Biden administration’s role in facilitating mass illegal immigration through agreements like the Global Compact for Migration and describes the process migrants follow to enter the country. They also touch on the impact of a Chinese production aimed at influencing Americans’ perceptions of China. Throughout the conversation, they emphasize the need for awareness and action to address these issues.  Natalie Winters discusses with Brittany Martinez the attacks Evie Magazine has faced for highlighting the side effects of birth control pills. Martinez explains that the magazine began discussing these side effects in 2019, prompting backlash from both the left and the right. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, their opposition intensified, with mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, Vice, and Jezebel publishing hit pieces against them. Martinez suggests that this increased scrutiny may be tied to political agendas akin to the censorship faced during discussions about COVID-19 vaccines. She emphasizes the importance of recognizing the broader agenda behind these attacks, suggesting that they may aim to silence women’s voices and perpetuate Big Pharma’s influence. Martinez also discusses how birth control pills affect women’s hormonal cycles, potentially influencing their behavior and decision-making. She highlights the need for women to understand their cycles and challenges misconceptions about birth control and fertility. Martinez invites people to follow her on Twitter (@Britt_Martinez) and encourages them to follow Evie Magazine for more information.  Thayer discusses the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their corruption. He emphasizes the CCP’s lack of legitimacy and characterizes it as a colonial government imposed by Western intellectual colonialism. Thayer advocates for exposing the CCP’s corruption and identifying its weaknesses to pave the way for its overthrow, allowing the Chinese people to determine their own form of government. He highlights the wealth of the CCP leadership as a target for scrutiny and emphasizes the need to reveal the regime’s hypocrisy. Navarro also mentions climate engineering programs and elite capture as significant issues. He criticizes Scotland’s new hate crime law as a step toward totalitarianism, influenced by the CCP’s model of control. Navarro concludes by discussing the importance of the upcoming election in countering the CCP’s influence operations and thwarting their broader goals.  The conversation revolves around the concept of the “Great Replacement Theory” and its application in various policies, particularly in the state of Michigan. Darren Beattie discusses how this theory, often considered controversial, is grounded in truth and needs to be addressed openly. Beattie draws parallels between immigration policies, the Chinese Communist Party’s influence, and the erosion of native populations in Western countries. He highlights a policy in Michigan known as the “newcomer renter subsidy,” which effectively subsidizes renters who are recent immigrants or even illegal immigrants, criticizing the policy for favoring newcomers over native citizens, including veterans, and emphasizing the perverse nature of such government actions. The discussion also touches upon broader themes of Western derangement and the erosion of traditional values and demographics.  The conversation explores various aspects of energy policy, mainly focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources. Dave Walsh discusses recent developments in EV regulations, including proposals to mandate a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032. He critiques the efficacy of EVs, highlighting that despite being labeled as “zero emissions,” they are still powered predominantly by fossil fuels due to the energy grid’s composition. Electric power generation and transmission inefficiency is also emphasized, with comparisons made to gasoline-powered vehicles. Furthermore, the discussion addresses the environmental and geopolitical implications of transitioning to renewable energy sources. The guests expressed concerns about the dependency on China for battery production and the environmental impact of mining lithium and other materials necessary for EV batteries. They also touch upon the economic and strategic implications of energy policies in the context of global conflicts, particularly referencing the situation in Ukraine and its impact on European energy supplies. Additionally, there is criticism of the lack of understanding and depth among Congressional Republicans regarding energy issues, with a call for more excellent education on the subject. The conversation concludes with the guest providing contact information for those interested in following their work.

Bannon said that the political elites and the media are shaping public opinion and supporting the Biden administration.   Abe Hamadeh appeared to talk to Steve Bannon about Kari Lake’s strategic maneuver in response to a defamation lawsuit brought against her, exploiting the legal system’s weaknesses. Despite the Supreme Court allowing the case to proceed to trial, Lake’s defaulting has caught her opponents off guard. By letting her case go into default and then requesting to see the damages owed for the alleged statement, Lake has shifted the narrative and exposed the lawsuit’s true intentions, which she claims are politically motivated. The following conversation highlights the legal system’s perceived bias and manipulation, prompting Hamadeh to call for investigation and accountability. Concerns about compromised elections and weaponized legal processes are raised, with Lake positioning herself as a fighter against corruption by Bannon.  Steve Bannon joined John Eastman to discuss Eastman’s recent disbarment recommendation and the perceived injustices in the legal process. Eastman alleges that the recommendation is filled with lies and misrepresentations, vowing to vigorously challenge it up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The conversation delves into the details of the legal proceedings, including claims of blocked witnesses and evidence. Eastman accuses the judge of bias and asserts his right to advocate for his client, arguing that reasonable legal theories were dismissed unfairly. The conversation touches on broader themes of government authority and the erosion of democratic principles, drawing parallels to historical authoritarian regimes. There’s criticism of Attorney General Bill Barr’s handling of voter fraud allegations and a call for accountability. The discussion concludes with a commitment to continue the fight against perceived injustices.  Natalie Dominguez, an education specialist on theft protection, shared a success story with Steve Bannon, highlighting the importance of safeguarding home titles. In the example Dominguez gave for how necessary these actions are,  she told Bannon about a family from Florida, who faced potential property loss due to fraudulent activity. Fortunately, they were subscribed to Home Title Lock, which alerted them to the suspicious activity and provided expert assistance in rectifying the situation. This underscores the significance of protecting home equity, which is often a homeowner’s most valuable asset.

He told Winters that he sees this as part of a broader lawfare and election interference pattern, particularly within the DC federal courts, promising further action and oversight.  Todd Bensman discussed his article on how President Biden’s administration has influenced the Mexican President’s stance on immigration, who has suggested that he will only slow the immigration flow to the US if he receives $20 billion, highlighting the leverage he holds over the situation.

Steve Bannon discusses the importance of Bobby Kennedy Jr.’s potential appointment as Secretary of Health and Human Services, linking it to the broader MAGA and “Make America Healthy Again” movements. He highlights how Kennedy’s advocacy aligns with the goals of challenging big pharma, the food industry, and agriculture. Bannon reflects on the shift in political views, mentioning Naomi Wolf’s transformation from a progressive to an ally in this movement, particularly focusing on concerns over the influence of big pharma in media advertising. Bannon praises Bobby Kennedy’s imperfections, drawing parallels to President Trump, Pete Hegseth, and Tucker Carlson, suggesting that these flaws make their work more effective. He emphasizes the growing support for Kennedy within the MAGA base, citing a pro-MAGA surgeon general from Louisiana backing him. Bannon explains the intricacies of the finance and health committees’ roles in the voting process, noting the significant financial interests involved. He also mentions Elon Musk, acknowledging differences but recognizing the potential for collaboration against shared enemies. Bannon alludes to historical alliances among rival factions and uses this to explain the current political landscape, where unusual alliances can form to advance common goals.  In this conversation between Tom Danz and Steve Bannon, Danz, speaking from southern Greenland, emphasizes the longstanding ties between the U.S. and Greenland, which are vital for understanding American strategic interests. He highlights a visit to the site of Bluey West One, a key World War II base, where the American flag flies at half-staff in remembrance of the sacrifices made by U.S. soldiers. Danz reflects on the role of Greenland in WWII and the tragic loss of U.S. Army transport ship Dorchester, which was torpedoed by a Nazi submarine, killing 672 men, including four chaplains from various religious backgrounds. These chaplains’ heroism is commemorated annually. Danz explains that Greenland’s importance lies in its strategic position, particularly during WWII when it became a key outpost after Nazi Germany invaded Denmark. The area’s geographical location is crucial today, especially in light of rising tensions with Russia. Bannon concurs, discussing how Greenland’s proximity to U.S. shores and its strategic role in countering Russian naval movements make it a key part of the "new great game” of global geopolitics, particularly in the Arctic. Danz also reflects on his time serving in President Trump’s administration, noting his work with the Arctic Commission and his efforts to highlight Greenland’s strategic significance. He calls for a renewed focus on Arctic policy and its importance to U.S. national defense. Danz encourages listeners to follow his new organization, American Daybreak, for further developments.  In this conversation between Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec, the discussion spans several issues involving China, Mexico, trade, and U.S. politics. Bannon criticizes the U.S. trade relationship with China and Mexico, highlighting how Chinese goods are being funneled through Mexico to bypass tariffs and claim a “Made in Mexico” label. He argues that this is a deliberate loophole exploitation that undermines American workers, with Chinese firms and workers involved in Mexican manufacturing. He stresses that the real trade war is between the Trump administration and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who have long collaborated with China’s Communist Party to benefit from globalization. The conversation then shifts to Tulsi Gabbard’s potential impact on U.S. intelligence, with Posobiec suggesting that her focus on restructuring intelligence agencies and taking on the massive budget could be a game changer. They also discuss the importance of Gabbard’s work with officials like Todd Young and her potential to influence national security. Posobiec briefly touches on rumors about returning to his intelligence work, but affirms his commitment to his current role. They wrap up by promoting Gabbard’s upcoming hearing and Posobiec’s live coverage on Twitter, urging viewers to stay engaged with the latest updates.  Natalie Winters talked about the details of her latest reporting.  In a revealing conversation, Larry Taunton shared his insights on the migration crisis and the role U.S. taxpayer dollars play in it. Taunton, who has spent five years tracking migrant caravans, highlighted the lack of questions about why people are coming to the U.S. from South and Central America. He explained that the failure of socialism in these regions, combined with U.S. agencies like USAID, is facilitating this migration, which he calls “human trafficking.” Taunton pointed out that NGOs, particularly those funded by USAID, are at the forefront of this operation, aiding the movement of migrants through treacherous routes like the Darien Gap. “These NGOs, including the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), are receiving millions of dollars to assist in this process,” he said. He went on to describe how these organizations operate in Colombia and Panama, with some migrants being moved to the U.S. without knowing their final destination. He also revealed that these efforts often involve cartels, with migrants paying hefty sums to be transported through dangerous areas. USAID’s involvement, through various NGOs, is a key factor in the continued flow of migrants into the U.S., and Taunton is calling for accountability. For more on his findings, he encourages listeners to follow his podcast Ideas Have Consequences.  Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the ongoing challenges of illegal immigration and the impact of U.S. foreign aid on the crisis. Bergquam highlighted ICE operations targeting criminal illegal aliens, noting that 58,000 criminals in New York alone are being pursued for deportation. He stressed the role of cartels and leftist politicians, with U.S. tax dollars allegedly funneled to support the illegal migration, and criticized the lack of accountability from the Biden administration. Bannon emphasized the need for transparency in tracing the flow of funds, particularly how money is channeled through various organizations, including charities that may be complicit in the crisis. Bannon endorsed a radical approach, calling for an investigation into the politicians and organizations involved in enabling illegal immigration, including Catholic Charities. He also called for defunding sanctuary cities and granting ICE more authority to apprehend individuals in prisons and jails. The conversation focused on the necessity of dismantling these systems to stop illegal immigration and hold accountable those behind it. Bergquam reiterated the importance of transparency and accountability, promising more updates through his show Law and Border. The duo stressed the urgency of the issue and the need for political action to address the border crisis.

Natalie Winters hosted the evening edition of WarRoom, and Steve Bannon hosted WarRoom Battleground. Natalie’s guests discussed FISA, a rally for President Trump in NYC on Monday.  Steve’s guests talked about transhumanism and a Judeo-Christian event.

Anna Paulina Luna segment for more details Reccomended Reading: Drug shortages reach all-time high Full show in segments: A bill to extend FISA was passed in the House but hit a snag due to a procedural motion from Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida. This motion will require another vote to advance the bill to the Senate before a looming deadline. The bill involves reauthorization, likely related to surveillance and intelligence matters, and there seems to be contention over including a warrant amendment. Some Republicans, dubbed as “Traitors,” voted against the amendment, aligning with Democrats. Representative Luna is depicted as a staunch defender of civil liberties and constitutional rights. She pushes for the inclusion of the warrant amendment to protect against warrantless surveillance and urges constituents to contact their representatives to influence their votes on the matter. Additionally, Representative Luna has introduced legislation to increase penalties for child sex offenders, advocating for harsh sentences, including the death penalty or life imprisonment. She emphasizes the importance of such measures in protecting children and deterring offenders.   The discussion with Mike Benz revolves around the contentious issue of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and its implications for civil liberties, national security, and political power dynamics. There’s frustration over what’s perceived as a lack of action on the southern border and a focus on the FISA debacle instead. The conversation touches on how FISA can be weaponized against political opponents, particularly within the Republican Party, and how it intersects with broader issues of censorship, misinformation, and domestic surveillance. Benz expresses concerns about the erosion of constitutional rights, particularly regarding warrantless surveillance and the targeting of American citizens. There’s a sense of urgency in addressing these issues, especially in light of the upcoming 2024 election, where FISA and related issues could significantly shape the political narrative. The conversation reflects a deep-seated distrust of government institutions and a belief that civil liberties are threatened by unchecked government power.  The conversation with Gavin Wax highlights concerns about the erosion of constitutional freedoms, particularly regarding the recent FISA controversy. There’s criticism of Republican Party leadership for what’s perceived as a disconnect from the base and the country’s foundational principles. The focus then shifts to an upcoming rally organized by the New York Republican Club to protest what they see as a politically motivated prosecution of President Trump by the Manhattan District Attorney. The rally aims to demonstrate support for Trump and opposition to what they view as unjust treatment. Participants are encouraged to join the rally with signs, flags, and enthusiasm to make their voices heard. Investigative reporter Barbara Warren’s involvement is also mentioned, suggesting a coordinated effort to mobilize support for the rally.  Grassfed Beff from wwwMeriwetherFarms.com  The discussion revolves around a panel event in Dallas, Texas, featuring Laura Loomer, Frank Gaffney, and Lieutenant Colonel Allen West. The event aims to discuss Israel’s fight for Western civilization and the two-state delusion. The conversation highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of the conflict in Israel and how it is not just about Israel, but a battle against Judeo-Christian Western civilization. The panelists will also address Israel’s challenges, such as the Biden administration’s policies and the internal political landscape. The event will take place at the hexa Event Center in Richardson, Texas, on April 14. Doors will open at 4 p.m. Central Time. The panel discussion will start at 5 p.m., followed by a Q&A session. For those who cannot attend in person, the event will be live-streamed on Real America’s Voice starting at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Throughout the conversation, Rabbi Pesach expressed his concerns about the two-state solution and the lack of consensus within the Jewish community in Israel and the United States. He emphasize the importance of understanding the true intentions of Palestinian leadership and the need for the Jewish community to support Israel’s efforts to defend itself against terrorism and radical ideologies. To learn more about the event and to sign up for tickets, visit the Dallas Jewish Conservatives website at dallasjewishconservatives.com.  Bill White discussed events in Fulton County, Georgia, following a successful fundraising event for President Trump. Despite the positive outcome of the event, WHite said,  the next day, Chris Carr, a prosecuting attorney appointed by Governor Brian Kemp, announced an investigation into Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones for alleged election interference. While believes this investigation is politically motivated and implicates Kemp and his associates, suggesting they are complicit in prosecuting Trump. White indicates a conflict of interest involving Ronnie Willis, who has been disqualified from prosecuting Jones due to her ties to his opponent and he questions the timing and motivations behind the investigation, alleging that Kemp opposes Trump and seeks to remove potential political rivals like Jones from the picture.  The conversation revolves around the increasing number of drug shortages in the United States, which has reached a new high of 323 medications. The root causes discussed include the dependency on foreign countries like China for active pharmaceutical ingredients and generic medications, supply chain disruptions, and the increased demand for specific drugs due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on mental health. Dr. Shawn Rowland suggests securing the supply chain and bringing production back to the United States is crucial in addressing this issue. However, they also express concern that the problem will continue to worsen as the necessary actions to resolve it are not being taken. In response to the issue, the speaker suggests that individuals can take action by using platforms like “Jase medical” to stay informed and potentially find alternative solutions to avoid being affected by drug shortages.  Mike Lindell is giving free shipping to the WarRoom with promo code: WarRoom  Joe Allen discusses the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and the singularity, emphasizing the unprecedented ability for individuals to imagine and create with the assistance of AI. The conversation delves into AI’s dark underside and the concerns raised by experts like Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen. Joe Allen, author of Dark AEon, provides insights into the underlying premises of transhumanism and posthumanism, warning about the potential consequences of AI surpassing human intelligence.  Bannon discusses the assault on traditional culture and civilization, drawing parallels between the destruction of traditional values by the Chinese Communist Party in China and the ongoing fight against global tyranny in the Western world. He emphasizes the importance of cultural preservation and resistance against oppressive forces like the World Economic Forum, the Chinese Communist Party, the KGB, the mullahs in Persia, and the deep state in the United States. The discussion touches on the tragic situation in Ukraine, where amputees are returning to the front lines due to a lack of support from the state.Ben Harnwell highlights the manipulation of mainstream media to shape public perception and underscores the need for vigilance against the erosion of rights and freedoms, as exemplified by the recent tie vote on warrants in the United States.

Steve Bannon, Natalie Winters, Mike Lindell, and a panel of guests anchored the WarRoom for Thursday night WarRoom and WarRoom Battlefield live from the Ahern Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The focus of the discussion was election integrity, with many audience members participating with the hosts to ask questions about the different legal cases currently in the courts addressing the use of machine tabulators in the 2024 election. Important Action Steps: In a conversation with Russ Vought, Bannon asked him for recommendations on when the WarRoom Posse should call and contact their reps.  Vought told Bannon that the Possee members must say to their repos to  “absolutely vote against the rule.  They need to vote against the procedural changes. That we do not want to fund the war in Ukraine. Keep the focus on the main thing that we are opposed to, which is this third-party payment of an endless war, and it is the rule we oppose. You have to be specific and vote against the rule,” Vought said, adding: “And everyone’s doing a fantastic job of it. When we make these procedural issues cut through the national narrative, members respond with surprise and say; I can’t believe my voters are, are registering this much information on the procedural matters.   But that is what we want. That’s the granularity. That is the moment that you have the ability to let them know that we see precisely what you’re doing. We oppose it, and show them they won’t get away with it.” US Rep Chip Roy echoed these same steps for activists to use. Full show in segments: Bannon hosted a panel discussion that focused on potential issues with electronic voting machines, specifically those from Dominion, and their implications for election integrity. The discussion highlights allegations of altered software, false representation of certification and testing procedures, and the presence of encryption keys that could potentially allow unauthorized access to election data. Attorney Kurt Olsen mentions a legal case in Arizona in which new evidence has been presented, including system log files showing software alterations and the use of uncertified software. The discussion emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues to ensure the integrity of the election process.  Russ Vought discussed a legislative process involving considering a bill related to Ukraine funding and possibly other matters. It seems that there are different perspectives within a political party regarding the handling of the bill, with mention of individuals like Mike Johnson, Hakeem Jeffries, and various members of Congress. There’s discussion about procedural matters, including votes in committees and on the House floor, as well as the involvement of different political factions and the influence of public opinion. The dialogue also touches on broader themes such as U.S. involvement in international affairs, party dynamics, and the role of social media in political advocacy.  Congressman Roy criticized the legislative process and content of a bill related to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, arguing it does not prioritize securing the border and is a capitulation to Democrats. He mentioned the Freedom Caucus’s opposition and former President Trump’s involvement, urging people to contact their representatives and voice their opposition to the bill.  Don Ahern, the owner of Ahern hotel,  expressed gratitude for the attendees’ of the WarRoom event and voiced his support for President Trump. Ahern announces a significant upcoming event where Trump will speak at the hotel, highlighting the removal of a central feature of the hotel to make room for a stage for the Trump event. The event is described as a fundraiser, emphasizing the importance of financial support for Trump’s endeavors. Ahern reminisces about his ties to Nevada and encourages the state to embrace Republican values. Details about the fundraiser are provided, including a text messaging service for updates and the event date. The speaker concludes with enthusiasm for the event’s entertainment and thanks the fellowship of patriots for making America great again.   During a discussion about election integrity and cybersecurity, John Mills shares insights from his recent trip to Taiwan, where he learned about their election procedures. He emphasizes the importance of having insiders or collaborators in addition to technical capabilities for accessing data centers. Mills highlights Taiwan’s simplified election process, which involves paper ballots and minimal computer involvement until the county level. He clarifies that he’s not making accusations but presenting real-world findings and best practices. Mills directs listeners to access more information about his work, including his show, books, and platforms such as Substack, Getter, and Truth. He also offers a discount code for his store.  During an evening broadcast, a private in the Army shares a personal story about being discharged from the military for having a photo of President Trump on his phone. He reveals his journey from Peru to the United States and expresses gratitude to the Republican Party for providing legal assistance to regain his citizenship. Despite facing challenges, including accusations of racism, he remains determined to continue serving his adopted country. The private encourages others to follow him on social media for updates on his situation. The host expresses support and applause for the private’s resilience.  Live audience participation from the Ahern Hotel.  At the Ahern hotel, also called the ” Freedom Hotel”, the CEO of “Repair the Vote” discusses their efforts to pass a constitutional amendment in Nevada requiring voter ID. Despite facing legal challenges from prominent figures like Mark Elias, they continue to collect signatures. Seeking both financial support and volunteers, they emphasize the importance of voter ID, citing widespread bipartisan support. They encourage people to visit their website, www.repairthevote.us, to contribute and get involved, highlighting the potential impact on elections and urging unity in their cause.

US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked about her actions to displace Speaker Mike Johnson and the very bold emergence of the UniParty, which refused to address the concerns of the America First agenda. Reccomended Reading: Democrats Save Johnson’s Military Spending— But Will They Save His Speakership? Full show in segments: Tim Burhett provided an update on the current situation regarding the fiscal packages, expressing concern about the escalating national debt. He criticized allocating additional funds to Ukraine, highlighting the failure of repayment promises. He lamented the lack of accountability among politicians and emphasized the importance of scrutinizing voting records. The congressman expressed frustration with fellow conservatives who make deals with Democrats and then espouse opposing views publicly. He accused the political establishment of creating distractions, such as the focus on Ukraine’s importance for democracy. He argued against further debt accumulation and warned of the consequences of losing control over government branches.  The discussion revolved around Bradley Delvin’s assertion that Speaker Johnson’s replacement could potentially do more harm than Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries. The conversation touched on the power dynamics within the House of Representatives and the implications of siding with Democrats. The focus shifted towards the upcoming votes and the possibility of a motion to vacate Speaker Johnson. Speculation arose about the outcome and its impact on Republican unity and governing capabilities leading up to the November election. Additionally, there was mention of strategic considerations from Mar-A-Lago insiders regarding the handling of the situation.  The conversation delved into the aftermath of recent events, particularly the Brexit moment and the morning show’s discussion about Republicans’ involvement in driving certain decisions. Bannon and Vought  had criticism directed towards members of Congress for potentially supporting actions akin to previous lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, driven by defense contractors. The discussion highlighted a perceived lack of awareness or engagement with alternative sources of information among certain politicians. Specific attention was paid to Speaker Johnson’s handling of various issues and his alignment with lobbying interests. The impending votes and the possibility of a motion to vacate Speaker Johnson were analyzed, with speculation about the potential fallout and its implications for Republican unity and governance. The role of grassroots activism and the need for informed engagement were emphasized, along with concerns about leadership’s response to increasing scrutiny and awareness among activists. Additionally, there was discussion about the arguments put forth by certain members regarding the necessity of specific actions and their alignment with the America First movement and former President Trump’s agenda.  Laura Loomer provided insight into the incident outside the courthouse, dispelling misconceptions propagated by the media. She described how an individual, later identified as Max Azarella, lit himself on fire in the Trump section, despite being a Bernie Sanders and Obama supporter. Loomer highlighted the media’s attempt to portray the incident as Trump-induced chaos despite evidence to the contrary. She revealed that NYPD confiscated a sign explicitly anti-Trump but left pamphlets containing Azarella’s manifesto. Loomer emphasized Azarella’s political orientation and provided details from his social media activity, including posts about rubbing alcohol and lawsuits against the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. She concluded by sharing her exclusive video footage and directing viewers to her platforms for further updates.  Colonel John Mills discussed the ongoing Chinese cyber attack, referred to as “Vault Typhoon,” which was first publicly reported in May of the previous year. He highlighted key events leading up to the attack, such as the signing of the fiscal year 23 National Defense Authorization Act, which provided support to Taiwan. Additionally, he mentioned a tabletop exercise called for in the act to test the resilience of domestic critical infrastructure in the event of war with China over Taiwan. Mills emphasized the seriousness of the situation, noting animated Congressional testimony from NSA Director Jen Easterly and Cyber Command Director. He criticized the allocation of resources, suggesting that efforts to address other issues, such as investigating January 6th incidents, diverted attention from the Chinese cyber threat. Mills warned of the preparation for war and the placement of malware on domestic critical infrastructure by China, urging the audience to take the threat seriously.  The discussion revolved around the potential consequences of challenging Speaker Johnson’s leadership and the arguments for and against such action. The speaker’s perceived failures and the risk of turning over control to Hakeem Jeffries were debated. Representative Johnson’s handling of legislative processes, particularly regarding a veteran healthcare bill, was scrutinized. The conversation highlighted concerns about the Republican Party’s ability to maintain voter trust and achieve its goals. Representative Johnson’s perceived alignment with Democrats and his approach to negotiations were criticized. The urgency of addressing pressing issues such as national debt and border security was emphasized. Despite concerns about risking Republican control of the House, there was support for challenging Speaker Johnson’s leadership. The discussion concluded with a call to action for concerned individuals to gather more information about the situation.  The Free Press Citizen at FreePress.com discussed Turning Point’s efforts to secure swing states like Michigan through their “Chase the Vote” initiative. Charlie Kirk spearheaded this initiative, aiming to raise $100 million for turnout efforts in key counties across seven swing states. The program has already been launched in Arizona and Wisconsin, with Scott Pressler leading the efforts in Wisconsin. Today, Turning Point Action announced its expansion into Michigan. While discussing polling data, it was noted that Trump has a chance in these states despite national polls suggesting otherwise. The website, known for its fast loading speed and absence of ads, provides comprehensive analysis and updates on election-related news.  Bannon and Vought talked about the frustration among many, which is palpable when they witness their own team engaging in actions like what happened with the Jacob Veterans bill, where it was stripped and replaced with unrelated items. This tactic, Vought said, undermines trust and leaves people feeling betrayed, especially when it involves prominent figures like Mike Johnson, who is considered a leader in Christian and social movements. According to Bannon, the recent moves regarding the dollarization process, seizing Russian assets, and destabilizing the financial system have only added to the dismay. Such actions are seen as not only damaging but also as potential acts of war and could have severe consequences for the country. The perceived alignment with the Democratic party on specific issues further erodes confidence in those who claim to champion America First principles.  Mike Lindell talked about specials in merch for the WarRoom audience.  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as Steve Bannon reminds us.

Steve Bannon hosted the Evening WarRoom program and Natalie Winters hosted the evening WarRoom Battleground. Cold Opens for the evening WarRoom program was footage from corporate media with talking heads deconstructing the Trial against Donald Trump and introducing Steve Bannon’s name into the conversation. Ben Bergquam, who was present in the courtroom then, reported during his segment that when Bannon’s name was introduced, it caused such a stir that the court had to be in recess for some time. Winters played cold opens that showed Joe Biden talking about a climate crisis. Highlights: Steve Bannon continued to expose Speaker Mike Johnson for not protecting President Trump, pushing for a criminal conspiracy. Ben Bergquam talked about what he had seen in the streets of New York, at NYU, where a wall has been constructed to control rioting, and highlights from Trump’s trial. Garret Ziegler reported on an update about the lawsuit Hunter Biden has brought against Marco Polo over publishing contents of Hunter’s abandoned laptop. Julie Kelly reported on the unconstitutional nature of the lawfare being used on President Trump and talked about a new report she has published on classified documents. Mike Lindell talked about deals for the WarRoom audience. Dave Walsh reported on the left’s use of Earth Dave to drive up the cost of living for Americans for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party. Col. John Mills discussed warfare tactics and the upcoming ‘Summer of Love’ riots ahead of the 2024 election. Dr. Naomi Wolf spoke about fertility and COVID. Bradley Devlin Editor of American Conservative, reported on the process for the Foreign Aid spending bill. Jim Hoft talked about a recent report on election integrity. Reccomended reading: Julie Kelly Tweet about Judge Cannon likely shows criminal conspiracy Complete show in Segments: Bergquam reported two New York universities where protests are unfolding: NYU Protests: Over 120 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested at NYU for defying a university order to leave.
A plywood wall was erected around NYU’s Gould Plaza in response to the protests. Bergquam said that most of those arrested were released on trespassing summonses, while a few received desk appearance tickets for charges like resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration. Columbia University: Bergquam said that President Menouche Shafik faces calls to resign due to ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at the Ivy League school’s Morningside Heights campus.   He said he spoke with students who opposed Israeli military action in Gaza and demanded divestment from companies they claim "profit from Israeli apartheid.”
An encampment was set up on Columbia’s South Lawn, coinciding with the college president’s testimony on campus antisemitism after the Hamas attack on Israel. Bergquam reported that these protests involve elements of Antifa, Black Bloc, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While primarily driven by the Sharia supremacist movement, there are broader dynamics at play in these demonstrations. The situation remains tense, and the goal is to insulate campuses while addressing the underlying issues.  Garrett Ziegler reported that he is heading to Nashville to give a talk on the controversial laptop issue. The talk will take place at the Hyatt House in Franklin, starting at 6:30 PM Central Daylight Time. Ziegler emphasized the importance of this laptop issue, highlighting the lack of mainstream support for his cause and the legal challenges he’s facing. He discussed the lawsuit against him regarding the laptop data and invited attendees to learn more about the topic. Ziegler stresses his commitment to the truth and encourages people to hear his perspective firsthand at the event.  Steve Bannon criticized several figures, including Jim Jordan and Mike “Polly Pockets” Johnson, accusing them of enabling a conspiracy to undermine the country. He argues that House Republicans are complicit in efforts to harm Trump and prioritize political gain over justice. Bannon called for action to expose and combat these alleged injustices, expressing frustration with the lack of action and demanding that Republicans defend Trump and his mission vigorously.  Crom Carmichael emphasizes the importance of maintaining heart health and managing cholesterol levels. He shares a testimonial from a satisfied customer who experienced a significant drop in cholesterol levels after using their product. Hearts encourages listeners to visit warroomhealth.com and use the code “warroom” at checkout to access a special offer on their subscription program. He highlights the effectiveness of their product and expresses gratitude for the opportunity to share it with the audience.  Julie Kelly reveals bombshell revelations on a classified documents case involving Trump. The scheme aims to drain Trump’s energy and resources to hinder his campaign efforts against Biden. Bannon says that it is a criminal conspiracy orchestrated by the Biden administration, DOJ, and intel community to entrap Trump. Despite Kelly’s viral tweets and detailed coverage, Republican leadership remains silent, focusing on trivial matters instead of addressing this significant issue.  Mike Lindell discusses a product called the roll-and-go travel pillow that features the American flag and a five-point star, which resonates with the audience’s patriotism. He emphasizes that customers who use the promo code “war room” on the website to make any purchase today will receive one of these pillows for free. He also mentions other specials available on the site, including discounted sandals and bathrobes. He thanks the audience for their support, noting that their purchases have helped the company’s factory reach full capacity again. Lindell ends by reminding listeners to stay safe during travel and promises to continue discussing the ongoing criminal conspiracy on the show tomorrow.  Bradley Devlin from The American Conservative joins the show to discuss Speaker Mike Johnson’s and Senate counterpart Mitch McConnell’s failures. He highlights how McConnell’s focus on Ukraine and Israel’s aid over securing the southern border reflects the establishment’s priorities, which diverge from those of Republican voters. Devlin expresses hope for a conservative reversion in the future but acknowledges the challenges faced by figures like Johnson who are influenced by intelligence agencies and proximity to power. The conversation delves into the disconnect between the establishment’s priorities and the concerns of conservative voters, emphasizing the need for alignment within the Republican Party.  Jim Hoft from The Gateway Pundit joins the discussion to shed light on what he believes is a critical issue for the 2024 election: fraudulent voter registrations. Hoft emphasizes the importance of cleaning up voter rolls to prevent Democrats from gaining an unfair advantage through inflated voter numbers. He highlights a report from True the Vote, which revealed 1.7 million suspicious voter registrations in Texas, indicating potential voter fraud. Hoft suggests that Democrats rely on these fraudulent registrations to secure additional votes, especially in battleground states. He cites examples from Michigan, where thousands of fraudulent registrations were tied to leftist organizations. Hoff expresses concern that Democrats are orchestrating a strategy to manipulate voter registrations to their advantage, potentially impacting the outcome of the election. He urges vigilance and calls for action to crack down on fake voter registrations to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process.  Dave Walsh discusses recent legislative moves by the Biden administration that seem to prioritize environmental policies over American energy security. He criticizes initiatives like endorsing Deb Haaland’s plan to restrict oil and gas drilling in Alaska, which he sees as detrimental to American interests. Walsh highlights the administration’s focus on incentivizing rooftop solar installations over utility-scale solar projects, which he believes is a misuse of funds. He suggests that these policies will increase the cost of living for average citizens and ultimately benefit China, which has gained a dominant market share in electrical equipment supply for power generation. Walsh implies that there may be financial motives behind these policies and suggests a connection between academic research funding and the promotion of climate change ideology.  Dr. Naomi Wolf discusses new data regarding fertility and reproductive issues potentially linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. The data, obtained from the Ontario health insurance plan billing code data via freedom of information requests, indicates a significant increase in fertility problems, menstrual disorders, miscarriages, and male infertility following widespread COVID-19 vaccination in Canada. This large-scale analysis, conducted by the Canadian COVID Care Alliance and presented by Amy Kelly of Daily Cloud, reveals alarming trends in female and male reproductive health post-vaccination. The findings underscore the urgent need for further investigation and raise concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility. The full analysis is available on dailycloud.io, where readers can also support the War Room Daily Cloud’s efforts in bringing attention to critical issues like these.  Colonel John Mills discusses the tactics of China’s fifth-generation warfare, focusing on its efforts to disrupt the elections in Taiwan. He highlights the role of social media platforms like TikTok in spreading misinformation and manipulation, citing examples of influencers spreading false narratives to create mistrust and division. Mills also emphasizes the importance of on-the-ground collaborators in executing these operations effectively. Additionally, he discusses the situation in Niger, criticizing the State Department’s prioritization of certain issues like transgenderism over national security concerns. He argues that the failures in Niger are indicative of broader issues within the State Department and questions the expertise of its diplomatic core.

There are no cold openings for today. Host Steve Bannon jumped right into the news.  Julie Kelly opened the WarRoom action by discussing a US Supreme Court case she would follow and tweet live about it. Bannon moved into interviews from the SCOTUS building and then lived in NYC. “Trump resonates with the working class, he says what we want to hear,” the leader of local 638 told David Zere Thursday morning in NYC. “They were cheering for Trump at the top of their lungs, and it was not staged,” Zere told Bannon. Highlights: Steve Bannon continued to slam the Republican leadership, focusing on Speaker Mike Johnson, saying GOP leadership in DC does not want President Trump to win. Julie Kelly spoke about her coverage of the US SCOTUS case. Mike Davis reported live from the US Supreme Court case dealing with presidential immunity. David Zere was seen reporting live at a rally by NYC construction workers for President Trump from 6 AM Thursday morning before Trump’s court appearances. Zere talked about bringing manufacturing back to the United States. Abe Hamadeh talked about his race for AG in AZ, and details about Trump EJ Antonni talked about the financial situation with new economic reports. Raheem Kassam talked about his new piece in National Pulse about Speaker Mike Johnson. Ben Bergquam reported live from the courthouse in New York City on the ‘hush money’ trial gave details about gag order violations and talked about AZ indictments that were made public Wednesday. Jack Ryan author Steve Stern talked about the Precinct project and a 3:00 call to action Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock Reccomended reading: Statement by Abe Hamadeh about AZ AG KASSAM: What the F–k is Mike Johnson Doing? Reccomended watching: Precinct project call Full show in segments: Julie Kelly will be live tweeting about the historic oral arguments regarding presidential immunity in the case Donald J. Trump versus the U. The case relates to indictments stemming from the events of January 6th and the 2020 election. Lower courts have ruled that presidents are not protected by immunity. Julie’s Twitter handle is @Julie_Kelly2 for real-time commentary. The proceedings are available on C-SPAN and the Supreme Court website. The discussion also briefly touches on Jack Smith’s involvement in a Florida situation, but details are limited.  Abe Hamadeh discusses ongoing legal battles in Arizona, where the AG just handed out felony charges to supporters of President Trump. He highlights his own experience as the legitimate Attorney General candidate, who lost by a mere 208 votes. He points out discrepancies in ballot counts, with what he says are 9,000 outstanding ballots, and alleges a broader criminal conspiracy targeting MAGA candidates and supporters. Hamadeh criticizes the legal system’s handling of cases and expresses frustration with Republican inaction. He emphasizes the importance of fighting for the America First movement and urges support for President Trump. Hamadeh’s website is abeforaz.com for more information.  EJ Antoni discusses the economic landscape, pointing out the discrepancy between GDP growth and increasing debt. He highlights the government’s reliance on deficit spending to boost economic numbers, artificially leading to structural stagflation. He emphasizes the importance of understanding these economic realities and advocates for a change in approach from Washington, DC.  David Zere reported live from New York City on President Trump’s surprise visit to New York, which received praise from construction workers’ unions, showcasing his support among the working class. The event was organized by Gavin Wax and the New York Young Republicans Club. Zere reported that workers expressed frustration with the current administration’s policies and showed enthusiasm for Trump’s promises to bring back manufacturing and protect industries like steel. Despite the organic support, the event contrasted with the ongoing political persecution against Trump. The absence of certain Republican leaders, such as  Speaker Mike Johnson, highlights a divide within the party regarding Trump’s role and the direction of the GOP.   Raheem Kassam and Steve Bannon discuss Mike Johnson’s actions regarding the speaker of the house and their disappointment in his lack of action on key issues. Kassam highlights the importance of focusing on critical issues such as immigration and illegal migration instead of diverting attention to less significant matters, which is what Speaker Johnson is seen as doing. Kassam emphasizes the need for Republican leadership to stop interfering and instead focus on important issues facing the country. He encourages listeners to visit The National Pulse website for more analysis and updates, including one article that caught Bannon’s eye and is on the recommended reading list. KASSAM: What the F–k is Mike Johnson Doing?  Mike Davis reports from outside the Supreme Court on a historic case regarding whether the president of the United States is immune from criminal prosecution for his official acts. He highlights the case’s potential implications and argues that granting immunity to presidents is essential to preserve the integrity of the presidency and the country. T he government’s central argument against immunity is based on the absence of explicit provisions in the Constitution or statutes. However, Davis emphasizes the importance of maintaining separation of powers and warns against the consequences of allowing a president to indict his predecessor for official acts. Later, he discusses the lack of action by the House on criminal conspiracy issues, especially in light of recent events in Arizona. Despite facing protests, Davis underscores the importance of upholding First Amendment rights while reporting on such cases.  Ben Bergquam reported live from New York City that President Trump has been in court, facing efforts to impose violations of a gag order on him. The prosecution is irritated by Trump’s disregard for their rules, particularly regarding mentions of David Pecker, which they see as a breach. However, the charges are viewed by some as a distraction from the real issues the prosecution wants, such as election fraud, which comes at the same time AZ Attorney General is making a big splash and bringing indictments against Trump’s supporters. in Arizona, there are concerns about a conspiracy involving 17 indictments, which some attribute to leftist tactics to manipulate the justice system rather than winning through conventional means. These actions highlight the ongoing battle over the integrity of elections and the role of the courts in deciding political outcomes and adds more suspicion of the need for a criminal conspiracy inquiry from the Republican led US House of Reps..  Steve Stern reported some successes with the Precinct Project. He added that Today at 3:30, there’s a crucial call happening, and Bannon emphasizes its importance, urging people not to “lean on their shovels but to join in”. The call will feature prominent figures like Christina Bob, Greg Stenson, Dr. Naomi Wolf, among others. Stern said they will discuss various topics, including removing illegal voters from state voting rolls and the differences between the timing in voting. Stern provides multiple ways to access the call, emphasizing action and participation.  Natalie Demente discusses the rising ease with which criminals can commit property fraud, highlighting the vulnerabilities in the system. County clerks often cannot detect fraud when processing property transfer documents, leading to potentially fraudulent transactions being accepted. Even if fraud is suspected, clerks are legally obligated to accept the documents. Resolving the issue often requires costly litigation if a fraudulent document is filed for someone’s property. Natalie emphasizes the importance of Home Title Lock in providing comprehensive protection against property fraud. Home Title Lock monitors property changes and intervenes to rectify fraud, giving homeowners peace of mind. She encourages listeners to visit hometitlelock.com and use the promo code “war room” to receive the first 30 days of protection for free, along with a complementary title scan to ensure their property’s security.  Jack Ryan discusses the concept of home ownership from an economic perspective, arguing against the traditional notion of it being a fundamental aspect of the American dream. He challenges the idea that owning a home is always the best financial decision, emphasizing the costs and limitations associated with homeownership, including transaction fees, maintenance expenses, and the lack of mobility it imposes. Ryan suggests that the push for homeownership is perpetuated by real estate cartels and politicians to control individuals’ behavior and tax them more easily. He advocates for a more objective analysis of the financial implications of homeownership. He emphasizes the importance of individuals having a stake in their communities through civic engagement rather than through property ownership. Ryan also discusses his company’s efforts to disrupt the real estate industry by reducing transaction fees and increasing transparency.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests.

Steve Bannon hosted the Wednesday morning WarRoom program. Today is a day of action, and the audience needs to note Charlie Kirk’s remarks below for instructions. The goal is to call and encourage Nebraska to change its state laws. Keep reading for instructions. Highlights: The Wednesday morning WarRoom program, hosted by Steve Bannon, highlighted various political, legal, and grassroots efforts to support former President Trump and criticize opponents within both the Republican Party and Democratic parites. Charlie Kirk urged Republicans to repeal Nebraska’s 1991 law, which assigns two electors to the state’s winner and one for each congressional district. The goal is to shift Nebraska to a winner-take-all system, potentially benefiting Trump’s chances in future elections. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen and Trump endorsed this initiative. Doug Mackey‘s case, where he was arrested for posting memes on Twitter and charged with conspiracy against civil rights, was discussed, raising concerns about freedom of speech. Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock discussed the growing problem of squatting and title theft, emphasizing the importance of homeowners safeguarding their properties and equity. Darren Beattie criticized the Biden DOJ’s attempt to suppress speech deemed as “disinformation” and discussed Mackey’s case as emblematic of broader trends targeting Trump supporters. Mike Lindell expressed gratitude for support in Wisconsin and promoted his product line, including special deals on pillows and other items. Dave Brat and Bannon discussed Jim Wallace’s gospel interpretation, highlighting skepticism about his approach and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing biblical teachings in education. Overall, the program aimed to raise awareness and encourage action on various political and legal issues while promoting unity among supporters. Each segment below provides insights into various issues and encourages audience engagement and awareness. Recommended Reading: Gospel of Mark (Bannon reads King James version) Darren Beattie’s letter to Elon Musk about Clinton crushing Meme case Recommended Watching: Elmer Gentry- the movie Bannon uses at the end of the cold open Crucial implements all Posse members need to have: Tool for Charlie Kirk’s Call for Action- BillBlaster Day of Action details:  Donald Trump and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen have endorsed legislation that aims to change the allocation of electoral votes in Nebraska, potentially removing Omaha’s pivotal electoral vote from consideration for Democrats. Conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republicans to repeal the state’s 1991 law, which assigns two electors to the state’s winner and one for each congressional district. Despite Republicans consistently winning Nebraska, the Omaha-based 2nd District voted Democratic in 2008 and 2020. Kirk called on Nebraskans to demand their state stop giving strength to their political opponents. Five hours after Kirk’s post on Tuesday, Pillen expressed support for a bill shifting Nebraska to a winner-take-all system. Trump also endorsed Pillen’s move, acknowledging the district’s significance in potentially deciding close races between Trump and President Biden. The attention on Omaha’s district underscores its potential role as a tiebreaker in presidential elections. Full show in segments: Steve Bannon opened the Wed WarRoom with clips from MSNBC showing the talking heads being highly emotional and highly charged about President Donald Trump’s surging popularity with key demographics Democrats rely on to win the presidency in 2024. Bannon highlighted the intense media coverage surrounding the upcoming election, particularly on MSNBC. The coverage focused on Trump’s actions at political rallies, and Bannon mentioned polling data indicating Trump’s strength in battleground states. He then critiques the Biden administration’s handling of various issues, including economics and immigration. Bannon deconstructed the strategy by Trump’s opponents to portray him negatively as an authoritarian figure while positioning themselves as defenders of true Christianity. This segment portrays a highly charged political atmosphere with strong rhetoric and strategic maneuvering that Bannon is known best for delivering to the WarRoom audience.  Bannon reflected on the Democrat’s political strategy and messaging in the context of the 2024 election. He emphasized the importance of knowing who to persuade and who to defeat in campaigns, mainly focusing on issues like abortion and the right-to-life movement. In this segment, he discusses the tactics of Trump’s opponents, including the Democrat’s attempts to portray him negatively, using stale political messaging, that he is an authoritarian figure, and working to divide voters along racial lines. Bannon said that he supports  Trump’s team countering these narratives and promoting Christian values with a turn of the phrase for “Transgender Day of Visibility,” like Trump did calling for a Christian Day of Visibility on election day at a recent campaign event. Bannon went into great detail, highlighting the significance of the Gospel of Mark in the Holy Bible, and contrasted that with the Democrat’s idea of Biblical teachings. Bannon critiqued specific interpretations of Christianity, which were discussed on MSNBC, in order to marginalize supporters of Trump, who MSNBC speakers say push a false “white gospel” that they want to be replaced with what Bannon calls a social justice warrior ideology. Bannon discussed his interpretation of Christianity and explained how that relates to his political views.  The conversation highlights the case of Doug Mackey, who was arrested for posting memes on Twitter and charged with conspiracy against civil rights. The case is foundational and historic. Mackey was charged to 7 months and $50,000 dollar fine. There is an appeal hearing on Friday. Bannon jumped into the legal implications of Mackey’s case, highlighting concerns about freedom of speech and the potential misuse of legal statutes to suppress political dissent. Bannon expressed skepticism about the charges against Mackey and criticized what he perceived as an overreach by law enforcement and the judicial system. Bannon argued that Mackey’s case for posting memes in 2016 is part of a broader trend of targeting supporters of President Trump who express views contrary to those of the ruling elites, particularly within the Biden administration and ahead of the 2024 election is chilling. The conversation underscores the importance of defending free speech rights and resisting efforts to criminalize political speech. Mackey directed people to MemeDefense.com to learn more about his situation.  Natalie Dominguez, a theft specialist at Home Title Lock, discussed the growing problem of squatting and title theft, particularly in light of recent viral videos encouraging illegal immigrants to occupy unoccupied homes. Squatting involves gaining access to a property without the owner’s permission and exploiting legal loopholes to remain there. It can lead to adverse possession laws granting squatters legal ownership over time. According to Dominquez, squatters increasingly resort to fraudulent documentation and lease agreements to prolong their stay and complicate eviction procedures for homeowners. On the other hand, title theft involves fraudulently transferring ownership of a property and exploiting its equity through lines of credit or unauthorized sales. Dominguez told Bannon that Home Title Lock offers triple lock protection against title theft, including 24/7 monitoring, title change alerts, and expert assistance. She emphasized the importance of homeowners being vigilant and taking proactive measures to safeguard their properties and equity. She encouraged homeowners to visit hometitlelock.com and use the promo code “war room” to receive 30 days of free protection and a free title scan.  Darren Beattie, editor of Revolver News, appeared on the WarRoom to talk to Steve Bannon about the growing fear and frustration over the lawfare of Trump supporters for posting memes and engaging in political speech. Beattie criticized the Biden Department of Justice (DOJ) for attempting to codify the suppression of speech they deem as “disinformation” into the legal framework. Beattie argues that this is a form of lawfare where the legal system is weaponized to silence political opponents. Bannon and Beattie highlight the case of Doug Mackey, who was arrested and convicted for posting memes on Twitter, as emblematic of this broader trend. Beattie told Bannon that he sees Mackey’s case as a test balloon for whether the government can imprison individuals for expressing opinions contrary to those in power. Beattie also criticized the collaboration of social media platforms like Twitter in Mackey’s prosecution, suggesting that they provided information to authorities that led to his arrest, which is the foundation for his article and letter to Elon Musk to remedy his part of the problem. Beattie calls for support for Mackey’s case and urges people to visit revolver.news for more information and to share the case details.  Charlie Kirk discussed a grassroots effort in Nebraska to change the allocation of electoral votes. The effort aims to move away from what they have- and to become a winner-takes-all system instead of one that distributes electoral votes based on congressional districts. This change could potentially give Donald Trump a better chance of winning the presidency. Kirk emphasized the importance of this effort and encouraged people to contact Senator Rita Sanders and Senator Raymond Aguilar, two specific state senators, to express support for the bill. He highlights Governor Pete Ricketts’ endorsement of the bill and President Trump’s backing of the initiative. Kirk stresses the need for respectful communication with the senators and urges individuals, particularly those from Nebraska, to advocate for the bill’s passage. He plans to visit Nebraska to support the initiative in person. Kirk sees this effort as crucial for potentially changing the electoral map and increasing Trump’s chances of winning the presidency in future elections. See notes above for more information:   Mike Lindell expressed gratitude to the War Room Posse, attributing their efforts to the success in Wisconsin this week. He then discussed his product line, including the rolling pillows available at a special price of two for $25. Lindell highlighted various designs that were available and encouraged listeners to visit the website to make a purchase. Additionally, Lindell mentioned discounts on other products, such as sandals, slides, premium pillows, and a four-pack dish towel set, all available for $25 each. Lindell concluded by expressing love for the War Room Posse and encouraging them to call in with their support.  The conversation between Dave Brat and Steve Bannon touched on Jim Wallace’s interpretation of the gospel from his new book, which some see as centered around social justice Jesus rather than the traditional teachings found in the Bible. Brat expressed skepticism about Wallace’s approach, noting that the Bible does not support a “white gospel” narrative and highlighted figures like Saint Augustine, who was not white but contributed significantly to Christian theology. The discussion also touches on the separation of church and state, referencing recent events like Joe Biden’s acknowledgment of Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter. Despite ideological differences, as Brat noted, the Democrats on MSNBC now shared belief in God’s sovereignty and the importance of traditional family values across Abrahamic faiths—which he argued should lead to a discussion of when Bibles go back into the American classrooms. Overall, Brat emphasized the need to prioritize Biblical teachings, reintroduce them into education, and focus on foundational principles like the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman. The conversation ends with a sense of optimism about the potential for unity and positive change- wich may or may not have been laced with a touch of witty, Brat, sarcasm. Listen, and you decide.

Natalie Winters hosted the evening WarRoom program, and Steve Bannon hosted the Wednesday evening WarRoom Battleground program. Highlights: Each segment covers different aspects of political, legal, and grassroots efforts related to various issues, including immigration, free speech, energy policy, and election funding. Full show in segments: The conversation between WarRoom host Natalie Winters and Monica Crowley mainly focused on President Trump’s recent remarks, particularly on illegal immigration and the border situation. Crowley emphasized the gravity of the issue, stating that it has become the number one concern across all demographic groups in the country. Crowley highlighted the contrast between Trump’s approach to border control and the current situation under President Biden, suggesting that this issue alone could significantly influence the upcoming election. Winters and Crowley discussed potential strategies that Democrats might employ to counteract the negative perception of their handling of immigration, such as deflecting attention to other issues like abortion or attempting to make the election a referendum on Trump. However, Crowley expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of these tactics, arguing that the widespread impact of the border crisis is driving a political realignment among traditionally Democratic constituencies. Additionally, Crowley discussed her podcast, where listeners can find her analysis on various platforms, including Apple, Google, Spotify, and Stitcher, and her social media channels, where she shares her written pieces and updates on her work.  Todd Bensman discussed the intricacies of the NGO’s involvement in the situation at the southern border, emphasizing the gravity of the issue. He described the massive influx of migrants, noting that the numbers were enough to replace the entire population of several states. Bensman reported from Mexico, detailing the crackdown on migration flows by the Mexican government, which he attributed to a secret diplomatic deal likely aimed at influencing the 2024 election. He contrasted President Trump’s and President Biden’s approaches to Mexico, highlighting Trump’s use of aggressive trade tariffs to pressure Mexico into cooperation on border issues. In contrast, Biden’s administration promised financial aid to address the root causes of migration, which Bensman criticized as ineffective. He suggested that the Biden administration’s approach lacked leverage and could potentially involve corrupt dealings. He also discussed Texas’s efforts to reinforce its border infrastructure in response to the influx of migrants, highlighting extensive fortifications along the riverbank, mentioning witnessing migrants attempting to breach the barriers and emphasizing the seriousness of Texas’s preparations for potential future challenges. To access Todd’s footage and further information on the border situation, he directed people to his social media profiles, particularly on X and Getter, where he regularly shares updates and content related to the border.  Steve Bannon opened the segment by referencing the movie Braveheart and comparing Scotland’s historic resilience and intellectual contributions to the modern world. The discussion then shifted to a serious topic regarding hate speech laws in Scotland. Peter Mcilvenna appeared with Bannon and explained that the Scottish Parliament had passed the new Scottish Hate Crime and Public Order Bill, criminalizing speech that stirs up hatred based on various characteristics. The bill was pushed through by the Scottish National Party and received significant support from other parties. The legislation has raised concerns among free speech advocates, comedians, and sports stars, as it imposes strict penalties, including potential imprisonment for offenders. The law encompasses a broad range of protected characteristics, such as race, disability, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Mcilvenna highlighted the case of J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, who has been vocal against certain aspects of the transgender rights movement. Rowling has faced backlash from fellow celebrities and activists but remains steadfast in her beliefs about biological sex and gender. The discussion emphasized the importance of defending free speech under increasingly restrictive legislation. Overall, the conversation underscored the significance of these developments in Scotland and the potential implications for free speech rights in other jurisdictions, including the United States.  Dave Walsh appeared on the WarRoom and criticized the Biden administration’s decision to draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), saying it was a political move aimed at influencing gasoline prices ahead of the upcoming election. Walsh said the administration has not followed through on previous commitments to replenish the SPR when oil prices fell below a certain threshold. He then added that he believes this manipulation of the SPR is ineffective in significantly impacting gasoline prices and is purely politically motivated. Walsh argued that the Department of Energy, responsible for managing the SPR, ultimately reports to the president, making it a decision within his purview.  Mike Howell discussed the significance of Wisconsin becoming the 20th state to ban private funding of election systems, often called the “Zucker Bucks” model. This model, seen in the last presidential election cycle, involved billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg providing funds to staff up and support local election offices in key demographic counties. Howell highlights the new iteration of this model, dubbed “Biden Bucks,” which involves federal government agencies working in collaboration with left-leaning NGOs to mobilize voters. Despite some members of Congress raising concerns, the House of Representatives ultimately funded this initiative, leading to criticism from Howell. Additionally, he mentioned an upcoming symposium addressing various policy areas and featuring notable figures such as FBI whistleblowers, Senator Grassley, and others. #WeapoSympo  In this segment, Mike Lindell discussed two main topics: a Supreme Court case update and news about a recall effort in Wisconsin involving Robin Vos. Regarding the Supreme Court case, Lindell mentioned that lawyers filed additional documents due to the defendants not responding, mainly focusing on issues related to election software manipulation in Arizona. The speaker encourages listeners to visit LindellPlan.com for details. Lindell also highlighted a recall effort against Robin Vos in Wisconsin, urging listeners to check out the new petition at SeenRecall.org. Additionally, Lindell promoted My Pillow’s spring sale, offering various discounts on pillows, towels, sheets, and other products using the promo code “warroom” and mentioning exclusive deals for the War Room Posse.

Meanwhile, on the other side, the La Linea cartel controls the flow of runners and escapees.

Despite the governor’s performative deployment of the National Guard, Toboroff reported that there seems to be a lack of meaningful efforts to address the problem.   She criticized the rhetoric of certain officials who downplay the severity of the situation and prioritize criminals’ rights over victims’ safety. She emphasized that the consequences of these policies extend beyond New York City and urged people in other areas to be vigilant.  EJ Antoni talked to Steve Bannon and  raised concerns about the latest jobs report, emphasizing the troubling trend of native-born Americans losing jobs while foreign-born workers, including potential illegal immigrants, are gaining employment. Antoni highlights the lack of transparency regarding how many of these foreign-born workers are undocumented and questions the impact of Biden’s immigration policies on job growth statistics. Additionally, there is criticism regarding the quality of jobs being created, focusing on the decrease in full-time employment. Overall, the segment raises questions about the accuracy and implications of current job market trends  In this segment, the discussion revolves around a recently passed 7.2 trillion spending bill in the U.S. House, which includes a two trillion dollar deficit. The guest, Ben Harwell, highlights the intentions behind certain initiatives, particularly regarding funding for Ukraine. He suggests that there may be attempts to spin the narrative to portray support for Ukraine as aligned with Donald Trump’s policies. However, Harwell argues that this is misleading, as there is resistance within the MAGA movement to allocate any additional funds to Ukraine. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the political dynamics at play and urges viewers to be vigilant in selecting their elected representatives. Overall, the segment delves into the complexities of political messaging and the potential implications of legislative decisions.  This segment’s conversation centers around recent legal developments, particularly regarding motions made in the context of ongoing legal proceedings.

Steve Bannon, Dave Brat, and Natalie Winters discussed Republican resistance efforts on Capitol Hill, highlighting legal and bureaucratic obstacles. They noted that establishment forces are using lawsuits and liberal courts to slow down conservative initiatives. A key focus was dismantling the FBI and USAID, which they claim funds left-wing agendas, including suppressing conservative media, supporting the southern border crisis, and covert operations in Ukraine. Winters emphasized the scale of opposition, mentioning a 50,000-strong mobilization. Bannon framed the fight as an all-out offensive, using wartime metaphors. They also touched on concerns regarding data mining and AI in government operations. The discussion underscored conservative frustration with entrenched institutions and their determination to overhaul the system.  Steve Bannon outlined key Republican priorities, emphasizing the need for strategic execution. He framed the political battle as a structured process, requiring discipline before achieving larger victories. Bannon identified three major objectives: ending U.S. involvement in global conflicts (particularly Ukraine and the Middle East), addressing mass illegal immigration through “nasty partitions” to remove millions of migrants since 2021, and tackling the financial crisis driven by $36 trillion in national debt. He criticized excessive federal spending, advocating for targeted tax reforms that benefit middle-class entrepreneurs rather than corporations. While supporting defense spending, he argued for a strategic overhaul to prevent self-inflicted economic harm. He highlighted Trump’s “geo-economic and geostrategic” vision, focusing on protectionism and hemispheric defense. Bannon also referenced internal Republican debates over budget cuts, particularly leading up to a March 14 deadline that could determine whether Trump shuts down his own government. He framed these financial battles as existential, warning of elite corruption and unchecked spending.  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discussed key financial and political issues, focusing on government spending, fiscal policy, and economic control. Bannon highlighted Jason Turner’s appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets, emphasizing its significance. Brat, known for his economic expertise, shared complex mathematical analyses regarding financial trends. Bannon underscored concerns about excessive government spending, deficits, and inflation. He noted that gold prices hit an all-time high due to the weakening dollar, attributing the decline in purchasing power to reckless federal expenditures. Bill Ackman and Elon Musk’s perspectives were cited, reinforcing the argument that current deficit levels are unsustainable. Bannon stressed the need for spending cuts and budget restructuring, explaining that Trump’s administration would approach financial control through executive actions, including delaying payments and reallocating funds. The discussion also touched on legislative challenges, particularly the Republican Party’s struggle to push serious budget reforms. Concerns over fragmented efforts in the Senate and donor-driven decision-making were highlighted, with emphasis on border security and tax cuts. Bannon warned that Democrats, despite current setbacks, still have significant resources, including media influence. He concluded by discussing Trump’s financial strategy, suggesting that controlling spending requires firm executive action. He argued that the judiciary would ultimately decide the extent of executive power in financial restructuring. Overall, the conversation reflected deep frustration with Washington’s fiscal mismanagement and a call for aggressive reforms.  Jim Rickards and Steve Bannon discussed the dire situation in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a strategic shift. Rickards criticized Ukraine’s current approach, including Zelensky’s demands for more aid and military support, and questioned the effectiveness of NATO’s involvement. He warned against the continued supply of ineffective weapons, like Abrams tanks and F-16s, which have failed on the battlefield. Rickards argued that Ukraine has lost the war and suggested that the U.S. should stop escalating the conflict. He proposed three options: accept Putin’s terms, continue fighting for better terms (which he deemed unlikely), or escalate to World War III. He advised that President Trump could end the war quickly with a phone call, but feared that advisors might push for a prolonged conflict to secure better terms. Rickards recommended cutting bait now, negotiating directly with Putin, and telling Zelensky the terms. He also criticized Zelensky’s leadership, calling him a military dictator rather than a democratic leader. Bannon agreed with Rickards’ assessment, emphasizing the importance of a free-market system in Ukraine and rejecting elitist interventions that hinder economic growth. Bannon also highlighted Ukraine’s Christian values, suggesting a more balanced approach to foreign policy, focusing on economic independence rather than globalist agendas. Finally, they briefly touched on the financial situation and upcoming changes in the U.S. Treasury, with Rickards promoting his new book, Money GPT, addressing AI’s impact on financial markets and global conflict. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discuss the current financial crisis and the challenges facing Congress in managing the budget. Bannon highlights the looming debt ceiling and the need for immediate action, stressing the importance of addressing tax issues and warning against ignoring letters from the IRS. He emphasizes the urgency of fiscal reform, particularly in light of the growing deficit and the inability of Congress to act effectively. Brat reflects on the unsustainable increase in federal spending, pointing out that the budget has grown from $4.5 trillion in 2019 to $6.5 trillion, without addressing the long-term debt problem. He advocates for imposing fiscal rules that would constrain government spending and limit deficits. Both express frustration with the lack of leadership in Congress, particularly in the House, and the failure to move forward on appropriations bills. They criticize the Senate’s inaction and call for stronger political will to tackle the fiscal crisis. Bannon also touches on the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy, warning that it could further enrich the wealthy while hurting the middle class. In closing, both agree that leadership and a unified approach are needed to address these pressing fiscal challenges.  Swearing in Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Steve Bannon and Carrie Sheffield discussed the significance of recent victories in protecting women’s sports from transgender participation, framing it as a pivotal moment in exposing the left’s stance on women’s rights. Bannon recalled Sheffield’s early warnings about the issue, which were initially met with skepticism but have since proven accurate. Sheffield described the ruling as an “earthquake” and a “restoration of women’s rights,” highlighting how the left has shown indifference to women’s safety and fairness in sports. Sheffield criticized the Democratic Party for abandoning the feminist principles it once championed, arguing that its refusal to define “woman” has led to an inability to defend women’s rights. She framed the issue as part of a broader ideological battle between truth and disorder. Bannon echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that the struggle extends beyond politics into fundamental moral and cultural conflicts. They also addressed the Biden administration’s attempt to rewrite Title IX, accusing it of undermining the protections originally intended to ensure fairness for female athletes. While celebrating state-level victories, Sheffield stressed the need for federal protections to prevent funding from supporting schools that allow transgender athletes in women’s sports. She dismissed leftist claims that only privileged suburban girls care about the issue, arguing that it’s about upholding objective truth and foundational values.  Steve Bannon and Terry Shilling discussed the broader implications of the transgender movement on feminism, gender identity, and federal policies. Shilling recalled initial skepticism when the issue of biological men competing in women’s sports was first raised. He emphasized that the feminist left has been largely absent or complicit in the movement because their ultimate goal is to erase gender distinctions altogether. Shilling argued that this agenda seeks to create an androgynous society where men and women are indistinguishable, making people easier to control. He pointed out that the growing “gender industry” is a multi-billion-dollar business, heavily funded by taxpayer dollars through Medicaid and state funding, and that the push to normalize gender transitions has led to both adults and children being subjected to medical procedures. Bannon and Shilling agreed that Trump has successfully exposed this issue to the public, making it a top concern for swing voters. They stressed the importance of holding politicians accountable, forcing Democrats to take a public stance on whether biological men should compete in women’s sports. The issue remains a “live fire exercise,” with the potential to drive uncomfortable but necessary conversations that could shift electoral outcomes.  Natalie Winters reported from the WHite House and talked about the latest details of the Trump’s administration’s moves on USAID and the reaction from the Democrats.  Steve Bannon and Todd Bensman discussed several critical issues, focusing on border security, supply chains, and geopolitical tensions. Bensman noted that under Trump, illegal crossings at the southern border had dropped significantly to around 400-500 per day due to detentions, expulsions, and deportations. He emphasized that Mexico was now dealing with the brunt of the migrant crisis, as U.S. policies deterred crossings. He argued that securing the border was a matter of enforcing existing laws rather than requiring new legislation. Bannon and Bensman also discussed the role of the military in maintaining border security, stressing that continued enforcement was necessary to prevent a resurgence in illegal immigration. Bensman highlighted the shift in immigration policy, with fewer illegal crossings and increased deportations, particularly through flights to countries like India, China, and Colombia. Additionally, Bannon touched on supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly regarding pharmaceuticals, which remain heavily dependent on China. He urged preparedness, promoting Jace Medical as a solution for securing essential medicines. The conversation reflected broader concerns about national security, economic independence, and the effectiveness of Trump’s policies in addressing these challenges.

Mike Lindell talked about lawfare and pillows- and offered a special deal to the WarRoom audience. Jack Posobiec talked about the nationalist-populist movement in Spain. Suggested watching: Weaponization hearing The strategic Common Man CPI, focusing on essentials like food, energy, shelter, clothing, utilities, and insurance, has shown a consistent increase, surpassing official numbers for 9 months straight. Gold has risen in 34 of the last 40 months, indicating inflation as a significant concern. This suggests that inflation is no longer a campaign issue and that Biden may have lost ground on it. EJ Antoni emphasizes that the real impact on Americans’ lives is more severe than the headline numbers suggest, especially in housing costs, which have surged far beyond what official statistics reflect.  Rep. Plaskett spoke at the weaponization hearing and said that President Trump demands absolute loyalty from all his followers and especially from GOP officials and those who work for him.   She pouted that many Americans have flocked to New York City to demonstrate their allegiance, standing with him despite the ongoing investigations. Plaskett moaned that Trump expects every Republican official to use their positions to aid his legal defense, even as criticism mounts, decrying his loyalists, including Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, for openly mocking Republican leaders who they feel aren’t doing enough to defend Trump. Plaskett told the committee that the WarRoom demands action, not just words, insisting that the federal government should actively protect Trump from legal repercussions.   She added that Trump’s supporters in the media echo these sentiments, pressuring Republican leaders to act decisively in Trump’s defense.  Bob Costello told the Weaponization Committee that he was the attorney for the Southern District of New York and denied representing Donald Trump or any of his associates despite having represented other high-profile individuals.

He highlights the process of appointing a committee to choose the flag design and criticizes the lack of transparency and public input in the decision-making. Turbo argues that the adoption of this flag symbolizes a shift in the state’s identity and questions the Republican Party’s response to the issue, attributing it to Democratic dominance in Minnesota.  Gene Hamilton testified and emphasized the importance of action in pursuing justice and morality to counteract the negative impacts of human ambition. He talked about the founding principles of the American system, emphasizing the need for a strong but not omnipotent federal government that respects individual liberties and prevents tyranny. However, he expresses concern about the current concentration of power in the federal government, particularly under President Biden’s leadership, and suggests that this concentration leads to political persecution and division.

Kash Patel gave updates on his book Government Gangsters and also talked about an Op-Ed he has up on the WarRoom.org site.

Cold Open was footage of Speaker Mike Johnson and Majorie Taylor Greene separately talking about and reacting to the day’s events over a potential motion to vacate. Highlights: Julie Kelly Broke the news that Judge Cannon won’t set a new date and hold hearings on Jack Smith. Andrew Giuliani talked about the New York City Trial of Donald Trump. Todd Bensman spoke about his article in the New York Post. Mike Davis talked about how to end lawfare against Republicans. Kash Patel spoke about the Jan. 6th, 2021 National Guard Scandal Reccomended Reading: Why Biden’s Gaza refugee plan is a hard hell no Andrew Giuliani’s Twitter Feed Full show in segments: Julie Kelly reports breaking news in the classified documents case. Judge Alien Cannon has vacated the May 20th trial date and is refusing to set a new one, citing prudence. Instead, she plans to hold key hearings that will likely trouble Jack Smith, Trump’s co-defendant. These hearings include motions to dismiss based on selective and vindictive prosecution, the unlawful appointment of Jack Smith, and a partial evidentiary hearing on the scope of the prosecution team. Cannon’s actions indicate a serious approach to the case, putting pressure on Smith and his team to explain their actions. The burden on Cannon to uncover evidence highlights the lack of oversight from institutions like the House Judiciary Committee. Kelly’s detailed reporting provides crucial insights into the case’s developments.  Andrew Giuliani reports on a tumultuous day in Manhattan court, where a street brawl erupted during proceedings. Giuliani describes the trial as a smear campaign against Donald Trump, with Stormy Daniels’ testimony veering off course. The trial has become highly prejudicial despite the judge’s attempts to rein in the prosecution’s salacious details. Giuliani highlights Stormy Daniels’ admission of a monetary motive, a pivotal moment in the defense’s case. The prosecution’s insistence on including such details suggests a desire to shame Trump rather than focus on factual evidence. Overall, Giuliani emphasizes the biased nature of the trial and the media’s complicity in sensationalizing it.  Today on the show, there was a heated discussion about the Biden administration’s proposal to bring Gaza war refugees into the United States. Todd Bensman, a prominent figure in counterterrorism, highlighted the dangers of such a move, arguing that bringing individuals from an environment of anti-American indoctrination and hostility towards the US would pose significant security risks. He emphasized the need for congressional action to prevent this proposal from being realized. Todd’s insights were shared in an article published in the New York Post, and you can find more of his work on his website and social media channels. Mentioned: Why Biden’s Gaza refugee plan is a hard hell no  Today’s show featured a promotion for My Pillow products, including the My Pillow and various other items like slippers, sandals, and socks. The host highlighted the quality of the products, particularly praising the USA socks as the best he’s ever worn. He also mentioned special deals available, such as discounts on bulk purchases and buy-one-get-one-free offers. Listeners were encouraged to take advantage of these specials by calling the provided phone number.  Natalie Winters talked about corporate media and vaccine injuries from her investigations.  Mike Davis is expressing frustration with the lack of action and defense from Republican politicians regarding various legal issues surrounding former President Trump. He highlights the lack of resistance against Democratic prosecutors and expresses disappointment in the absence of a strong fight, contrasting it with past battles like the confirmation of Supreme Court justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Davis emphasizes the pivotal role of key figures such as President Trump, Don McGann, Mitch McConnell, Mark Paoletta, and himself in ensuring Kavanaugh’s confirmation despite significant opposition. He criticizes many Republican politicians for not showing the same level of commitment and urges them to step up and defend their party’s interests.  The conversation discusses the recent New York Times article confirming that former President Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard before January 6th. This revelation contradicts the narrative that Trump refused to authorize the National Guard. Instead, it was other individuals, including Bowser and Pelosi, who reportedly delayed the deployment. The discussion highlights the chain of command and how certain officials allegedly obstructed Trump’s orders. The conversation criticizes those involved for their actions and calls for accountability. Additionally, it suggests that this information exonerates Trump from any insurrection charges. The conversation ends with a call for further investigation and emphasizes the importance of revealing the truth to the American people.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests.

The cold open was Joe Biden, looking and sounding very feeble and weak, talking about the economy, juxtaposed with commentary about Trump’s economy and foreshadowing by Hillary on MSNBC talking about Trump. MTG’s motion to vacate footage, with the Uni-party booing. “We should call the bluffs of people right now and find out now. This is the great unmasking. If your congressman wasn’t on the list of the 11, you should call them,” Bannon said. Highlights: Steve Bannon talked about the process in DC that does not address the needs of the American people. Steve Stern talked about the Precinct Project. Eli Crane spoke about why he supported MTG’s motion to vacate. Adam Molan talked about his new article covering Peter Navarro. Brody Mullins talked about his new book. US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked about her motion to vacate on Thursday. Full show in segments: Natalie Winters and Steve Bannon open the program with cold open footage that shows Democrat Joe Biden speaking about President Trump and the economy in a very low-energy voice, making bold statements.  Democrat Hillary Clinton is seen in the footage compilation as well, which causes Steve Bannon to rip apart and expose decades of corruption by both Hillary and Bill Clinton that happened during all of their years in public service.  Steve Stern heads up the discussion about the powerful Precinct Project, giving details of the next group call for all interested parties who would like encouragement and instruction on how to get into their local parties and get control away from RINOS.  Stern talked about his upcoming birthday celebration and some of the newest campaigns the group is working on, including getting writers in every state to start newsletters to inform the public of the action they are taking.  US Rep. Eli Crane talked about his motivations for supporting US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on her motion to vacate the Speaker’s chair on Wednesday, and he spoke about the importance of what Greene was doing regarding saving the Republic. Crane told Bannon that his constituents in AZ supported him and the stand he took and that the disconnect was between the people and the Reps who voted with the Uniparty.  US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked to Steve Bannon about her motion to vacate, reconfirming that she felt it was the right thing to do to expose the power in DC and how the other reps who make up the uni party are not listening to the concerns of the people.  She disagreed with others who said her actions were dangerous to the Republican majority.  Brody Mullins talked about his new book, the Wolves of K Street, and gave Steve Bannon a preview of the secret history of how big money took over the big government and formed an almost unbeatable alliance.  The little guys are not represented at all anymore, which is the feeling of the average American, and the people with money, as described, seem to get all the breaks.  Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock talked to Steve Bannon about the very scary reality of a woman who lost her home after the title was stolen.  A woman went through legal battles to rescue and salvage what was left of her property after a thief stole her home.  Adam Molon makes his case to Steve Bannon about why he wants President Trump to choose Peter Navarro for his running mate for the 2024 Presidential elections.  Molon wrote a piece for Epoch Times outlining his point of view and discussed with Bannon.

Brian Glenn reported from the White House Press pool at the National Day of Prayer to discuss the event that Joe Biden missed last year.  Glenn also mentioned Trump’s announcement that he would implement a new government department to defend and protect Christians and Christianity.  Natalie Winters reported on the activity of Norm Eisen and the Democrats and the growing resistance to counter President Trump’s actions. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon discussed the ongoing resistance by Senate Democrats to President Trump’s nominees, comparing their obstruction tactics to those used by Mitch McConnell against President Obama in 2009. He highlighted how key figures like Russ Vought, Mark Paoletta, and Jeff Clark were being targeted in a prolonged confirmation process. Bannon emphasized that Democrats were using procedural delays, keeping the Senate up all night, and attempting to block conservative appointments, particularly those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for HHS, Tulsi Gabbard for DNI, and Pam Bondi for Attorney General. He noted that Democrats were panicking as they lost control over key agencies and were launching aggressive countermeasures, including additional committee hearings and media attacks on figures like Kash Patel. As the discussion transitioned, Dave Brat joined to emphasize the significance of the National Prayer Breakfast. He framed it as a crucial event in what he described as an ongoing spiritual war, underscoring the role of faith in political and cultural battles. The segment shifted focus from political maneuvering to the broader ideological and moral struggles shaping the country’s leadership.  Steve Bannon’s comments emphasize the need for deep investigations into what he sees as coordinated efforts by intelligence agencies, Capitol Hill leaders, and the political establishment to undermine former President Trump. He argues that Trump was targeted similarly to past figures like Nixon, JFK, and RFK, suggesting a longstanding pattern of elite intervention. He calls for a special prosecutor and grand jury to expose these actions, particularly regarding election interference and Biden’s alleged foreign financial entanglements, which he believes were deliberately covered up. Bannon also critiques the "Deep State” and its control over government spending, foreign policy, and economic policies. He argues that bipartisan elites have protected each other’s interests at the expense of the American people, funding programs that benefit globalist agendas while ignoring fiscal responsibility. He calls for drastic budget cuts, particularly in defense and foreign aid, and warns of financial collapse due to unsustainable debt. He further highlights mass illegal immigration as an urgent crisis, advocating for mass deportations. He acknowledges the challenges ahead, describing it as a battle between the Deep State and the Trump movement. Bannon ties this struggle to broader geopolitical shifts, urging action against economic and political forces he believes are eroding American sovereignty.

Mike Davis and Steve Bannon discussed the legal and political challenges facing President Trump, emphasizing the need for a strong, aggressive legal strategy. Davis highlighted how Trump is using his constitutional authority to push reforms, including cutting wasteful spending, ending weaponization of intelligence agencies, and combating activist judicial overreach. However, opponents are seeking court injunctions to block these efforts. Davis urged the Trump Justice Department to aggressively seek emergency relief from appellate courts and the Supreme Court to override activist judges. They also discussed broader judicial concerns, criticizing the DC District Court for its handling of January 6 defendants and its broader political bias. Davis called for legislation to curb judicial overreach and limit the power of activist judges. On government restructuring, Davis supported Trump’s plans to downsize agencies like USAID, viewing it as a necessary step to rein in wasteful spending. He argued that under Article 2 of the Constitution, the president has the authority to manage the executive branch, including hiring and firing federal employees. The discussion also touched on the issue of impoundment, with Davis supporting Trump’s authority to prevent misallocated funds, particularly regarding foreign aid. The conversation underscored Trump’s commitment to reshaping government despite legal and political opposition.  Maureen Bannon shares her experience on a working birthday trip in the South Pacific, emphasizing that there’s no time off for the WarRoom Posse. Steve Bannon jokes about keeping her busy despite the time difference. She promotes CPAC, encouraging people to get discounted tickets and attend the Force Multiplier Academy on February 19. Steve highlights a special WarRoom event at CPAC with audience participation and a free lunch. He notes that their presence has previously caused noise complaints. Maureen shares her social media handles and jokes about bringing the tropical view back via a green screen for the event.  Natalie Winters reported from the White House about the strengths of the people nominated to be a part of President Trump’s administration.   Steve Bannon’s comments reflect his deep skepticism toward institutions like USAID, the Pentagon, and the Treasury, which he argues are controlled by the deep state and globalist interests. He claims USAID is a CIA front supporting illegal immigration, foreign influence, and suppression of conservative voices. Bannon calls for its complete shutdown, asserting that many involved are criminals. He criticizes the Treasury for failing to prevent fraudulent payments and questions its leadership’s credibility. He insists President Trump must address these issues, particularly regarding economic policies and budget priorities. Bannon highlights the importance of Russ Vought and Scott Bessent as key figures in shaping a strong-dollar policy and fiscal responsibility. On defense spending, Bannon demands substantial cuts, arguing that the Pentagon is rife with incompetence, corruption, and waste. He insists that real budget reductions must begin with the defense sector, rather than superficial discretionary spending cuts. He also takes aim at defense contractors and their potential conflicts of interest, particularly SpaceX, raising questions about its government funding. Overall, Bannon frames the battle over government spending as a defining moment for Trump’s presidency, calling for a populist-driven, adult conversation on financial responsibility and systemic reform. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Catherine O’Neil discussed the challenges of government reform, the significance of recent executive orders benefiting Christians, and efforts to scrutinize foreign aid spending. O’Neil highlighted her visit to the State Department, praising the reduction of USAID’s workforce by 97% as a major victory against unaccountable spending. She reflected on the struggles of the previous Trump administration due to personnel issues and a lack of support but expressed optimism about the current team’s ability to execute Trump’s agenda effectively. Bannon emphasized the need for continued scrutiny of taxpayer dollars, calling USAID a "rat’s nest” of corruption. O’Neil detailed how funds were funneled through NGOs, making them difficult to track. Both agreed that radical transparency and alternative media have strengthened their movement. Bannon praised young conservative activists for their resilience and commitment, urging them to stay engaged in the fight for government accountability. https://rumble.com/embed/v6fmtf4/?pub=c28ob Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the challenges of immigration enforcement, sanctuary cities, and the role of federal authorities in addressing illegal immigration. Bannon emphasized the need for tougher measures against officials who obstruct immigration enforcement, suggesting that arresting non-compliant officials could send a strong message. Bergquam highlighted the inefficiency and cost of current enforcement strategies, advocating for better intelligence, expanded detention facilities, and a shift from administrative to criminal warrants. They criticized states like Illinois and California for resisting federal enforcement and using taxpayer money to oppose Trump’s policies. The conversation also touched on cartel activity in Mexico, with Todd Bensman revealing that U.S. intelligence and Mexican military forces were preparing for kinetic operations against drug cartels, including targeting fentanyl labs and trafficking networks. He noted that previous border security efforts had significantly reduced human smuggling, forcing cartels to rely more on drug trafficking. Bergquam and Bensman warned that cartels, heavily armed with profits from past operations, would not surrender their business without a fight, predicting imminent confrontations. The discussion framed the situation as a battle over national security, urging stronger federal action and strategic military cooperation to dismantle cartel operations. Part One:  Part Two:

US Rep. Andy Biggs and Steve Bannon discussed the recent historic decision by the House of Representatives to hold the US Attorney General in contempt of Congress. This rare event, only the third in US history, occurred due to the Attorney General’s failure to comply with subpoenas from three committees despite numerous opportunities provided. Biggs highlighted the importance of obtaining audio recordings from interviews conducted by Special Counsel Robert Hur with Joe Biden and his biographer, which reportedly contain evidence of Biden’s mishandling of classified information. Biggs criticized Hur’s decision not to prosecute Biden, citing concerns about Biden’s memory and the potential sympathy of a jury. The Congressman emphasized the need to review the audio tapes to verify the validity of Hur’s prosecutorial discretion and to consider impeachment proceedings against Biden. Biggs argued that the Department of Justice’s refusal to release the tapes suggests a political cover-up and insisted that Congress has the constitutional right to access the evidence. The discussion also covered the procedural next steps, including the possibility of appointing a special House counsel to pursue civil action if necessary. Biggs stressed the need for aggressive oversight and accountability, particularly in light of the perceived weaponization of the federal government against conservatives. He called for more assertive actions to restore balance and ensure the rule of law.   Julie Kelly, speaking with Steve Bannon, praised the House Republicans and leadership for holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, marking only the third time this has happened. Kelly emphasized that this action will draw public attention to Garland’s refusal to release the audio recordings of Joe Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. She argued that this is among the least of Garland’s offenses, citing his history of weaponizing the Justice Department against figures like Donald Trump and January 6th protesters. Kelly criticized the Justice Department’s handling of the classified documents case in Florida, describing it as corrupt and sloppy. She mentioned the mishandling of evidence during the Mar-A-Lago raid, including alleged doctoring of photos and improper handling of privileged communications. Bannon and Kelly discussed the parallels between Biden’s situation and Trump’s, suggesting the Biden audio tapes must be damaging for Garland to risk contempt charges. Additionally, Kelly highlighted Garland’s attempts to conceal evidence, including January 6th security footage, which Republicans are now making public. She underscored Garland’s double standards and his efforts to shield critical information from the American people. The conversation briefly touched on the ongoing legal proceedings involving Trump, including motions to dismiss the Mar-A-Lago case due to alleged mishandling and falsification of the search warrant.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the recent decision to hold US Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, highlighting it as a significant and overdue step. Winters expressed satisfaction with the move but stressed that many more individuals need to be held accountable, such as the 51 intelligence officers who she claims lied. She criticized the current process of private depositions and slow release of information, advocating for public hearings with meaningful questions. Winters argued that House Republicans must push for real accountability and avoid the limited actions that only give the appearance of progress. She drew attention to what she perceives as a double standard, where Republicans face harsher scrutiny for defying Congressional subpoenas compared to Democrats. Bannon and Winters agreed that what is needed is not retribution but justice.  Mike Lindell and Steve Bannon discussed recent developments in the recall effort against Robin Voss in Wisconsin. Lindell announced that a significant legal filing had been made by lawyer Kevin Scott, which mandates the Wisconsin Election Commission to set the recall election for July 9th. Lindell emphasized the importance of this recall, stating that Voss has blocked numerous efforts to secure election integrity and reforms, particularly those addressing issues from the 2020 election. Removing Voss, according to Lindell, would open doors for the MAGA movement and broader Republican efforts in Wisconsin. The conversation then shifted briefly to promotional deals on Lindell’s products, including discounts on mattresses with a six-month money-back guarantee and a 10-year warranty. Lindell urged viewers to take advantage of these deals by visiting his website or calling a provided phone number.  In their discussion, Steve Bannon and EJ Antoni reviewed the latest inflation figures and their impact on American consumers. Antoni noted that while the inflation rate has slowed to 3.3%, prices are still rising faster than wages, causing a decline in purchasing power. He criticized the accuracy of government metrics, particularly in areas like health insurance, which do not reflect the real experiences of most Americans. Antoni emphasized that many Americans are financially worse off, as indicated by various polls. Bannon and Antoni then discussed the economic impact of the increasing number of illegal immigrants, arguing that while these immigrants contribute to production, they also incur significant costs (e.g., using emergency rooms and public schools without adequately contributing to tax revenues). They highlighted that consumer spending, a major component of GDP, has turned negative, suggesting a potential decline in GDP for the second quarter. The conversation also touched on the high levels of consumer credit card debt, which exceeds $1 trillion, with rising default rates. Antoni explained that many consumers have maxed out their credit and are struggling to maintain their standard of living. They drew parallels between consumer reliance on credit and government borrowing strategies, noting that both are unsustainable in the long term. Antoni pointed out that real-life costs, such as homeownership, have increased far more than official metrics indicate. He highlighted that the net job growth has largely gone to foreign workers since the pandemic, with fewer native-born Americans employed today than before February 2020. To follow Antoni’s economic analysis, Bannon recommended his Twitter feed and Heritage Foundation’s website.  Steve Bannon and Malachy Steenson discussed the rise of nationalist and populist movements in Europe, particularly focusing on the European Parliamentary elections. Bannon highlighted the significant role of figures like Nigel Farage in the UK and the activities of nationalist parties across France and Germany. He emphasized the importance of following these movements closely. Steenson provided an in-depth look at the situation in Ireland, emphasizing the country’s historical commitment to sovereignty and nationalism. He criticized the current political class in Ireland for their alignment with the European Union and their handling of immigration issues. Steenson highlighted the significant impact of recent immigration policies on local communities, particularly the strain on housing and public services. Both Bannon and Steenson expressed concern over the erosion of national identity and sovereignty due to the influence of the EU and the influx of migrants. Steenson pointed out the unsustainability of current immigration levels given Ireland’s limited infrastructure and resources. He noted the revival of nationalist sentiment in Ireland, driven by the perceived betrayal of the political class and the pressure from increasing immigration. They discussed the potential for a general election in Ireland, speculating it might occur later this year. Steenson emphasized the need for a grassroots nationalist movement to reclaim Ireland’s sovereignty and protect its cultural identity for future generations. Bannon underscored the importance of such movements globally, noting similar sentiments rising in various countries.  Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell discussed significant political developments in the United States and Europe, emphasizing the rise of nationalist and populist movements. Bannon highlighted concerns about political threats, referencing comments from Kash Patel and criticisms from “Morning Joe,” stressing the seriousness of threats from political opponents. They criticized Donald Trump’s character and suitability for a second term, pointing to his authoritarian tendencies and disregard for constitutional norms. Harnwell updated on political shifts in France, noting Eric Ciotti’s support for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, a major change in French politics that challenges traditional separations between mainstream and nationalist parties. This potential collaboration could significantly impact European politics, particularly in the upcoming European elections, reflecting a broader trend of growing nationalist influence. Additionally, Harnwell emphasized the importance of grassroots support and engagement, highlighting the enthusiasm of MAGA supporters and noting that interventions from establishment figures like Paul Ryan only galvanize this base. Overall, the discussion underscored the increasing influence of nationalist and populist movements, the shifts in political alliances, and their potential impact on future elections and governance.

(Originally aired 6/18) In a discussion with Steve Bannon on the WarRoom program, attorney Cleta Mitchell expressed concerns about election integrity in Georgia, attributing issues to a deep state within election offices nationwide. Mitchell traced the origins back to a 2013 declaration by left-wing leaders to spend millions altering America’s political system, focusing on election processes, campaign finance laws, and judicial confirmations. Mitchell highlighted significant financial investments by leftist billionaires and foundations since 2013, estimating $11-14 billion spent to transform voting methods. She described a deep state within election offices that trains and indoctrinates officials, creating a robust infrastructure for mail-in voting.  Steve Bannon lambasted the mainstream media, particularly targeting Rachel Maddow. He mocked Maddow’s emotional responses and predicted advertisers would flee from her show due to their unpopular stance. Bannon also derided accusations against Trump, calling the charges “phony” and criticizing left-wing efforts to portray Trump as a threat to democracy. Bannon praised “Project 2025,” a comprehensive 885-page plan prepared by conservatives, showcasing their readiness for the next election. He accused the Biden administration of being out of touch with American voters, blaming their radical policies and incompetence for losing public support. Bannon alleged that left-wing billionaires have spent billions to influence elections, describing this as an attack on democracy. He dismissed Maddow’s warnings about the end of democracy as out of touch, claiming that American voters see through the deception. Bannon emphasized the importance of grassroots movements and the working class, asserting that they are now aware of the misleading narratives pushed by the left. He concluded by predicting a political shift favoring conservatives in upcoming elections.  Steve Bannon commented on the failure of Kevin McCarthy’s political maneuvers, highlighting the defeat of McCarthy-backed candidates despite substantial financial support. Bannon criticized McCarthy’s strategy, emphasizing the deep unpopularity of his brand. He argued that only Donald Trump can lead the GOP, dismissing Ron DeSantis’s and Nikki Haley’s prospects as unrealistic. Bannon highlighted Trump’s unique role in the “American experience” and predicted his inevitable return to the presidency. Bannon also discussed the broader political landscape, expressing disdain for the establishment and media figures like Rachel Maddow. He claimed that the 2020 election “steal” was providential, revealing to Americans the corruption in the system. Bannon stressed that the MAGA movement, fueled by the working class, will not tolerate further deceit. Bannon mentioned ongoing issues like deficit spending and the handling of illegal immigration, asserting that the government is lying about the true costs. He promoted “Project 2025,” aimed at dismantling the administrative state. Bannon concluded by stating that the elite’s control is slipping, with the MAGA movement gaining momentum as Americans reject the current establishment.  John Solomon and Steve Bannon discussed documents revealing Hunter and Joe Biden’s alleged corruption involving Burisma. Solomon reported that Hunter Biden and his partners secured a deal to funnel $120 million from Burisma to a company in Liechtenstein, giving them a 25% stake in future revenue without any investment. This occurred just before Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma. Solomon highlighted that the FBI had these documents since 2016 but withheld them during Trump’s impeachment, which could have altered the proceedings had they been disclosed. The documents, obtained from Hunter’s business partner Devin Archer, show the influence-peddling scheme and the FBI’s awareness of it. Solomon criticized the FBI for not acting on this information, suggesting political motives. Bannon and Solomon questioned why the Obama administration, particularly FBI leaders like Comey and McCabe, didn’t address these issues, speculating that concerns about Joe and Hunter Biden’s activities were known but not acted upon to avoid political fallout. Solomon emphasized the importance of Congress demanding any briefings that Obama and Biden received about Hunter’s activities, asserting that this could clarify their awareness and inaction, making the scandal more comprehensible to the public.  Steve Bannon discussed the challenges facing the U.S. dollar and the implications of the recent CBO report, emphasizing the erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power. He highlighted that the BRICS nations are gaining geopolitical strength, particularly in Eurasia and Ukraine. Bannon criticized the U.S. government’s financial mismanagement, leading to massive deficits and a potential devaluation of government bonds, as evidenced by a Japanese bank’s decision to sell $61 billion in U.S. government securities. Bannon suggested that financial elites and hedge fund managers recognize the impending financial crisis, driving them to buy gold. He urged viewers to educate themselves on macroeconomics and capital markets to become self-reliant. Bannon also condemned the excessive government spending, which he termed as “human bondage,” benefiting only the elite while burdening the average American. He called for a change in management and more accountability, expressing support for political figures like Bob Good and Eli Crane, who oppose excessive spending. Bannon warned of a potential revolution if financial mismanagement continues, noting that younger generations are becoming increasingly aware and disillusioned with the current economic system. He emphasized the need for active participation and control to bring about change.  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discussed the negative impact of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s financial policies, criticizing his misleading claims of deficit reduction. Bannon emphasized that McCarthy’s long-term deficit reduction plans are deceptive, with no immediate spending cuts. Brat praised Bob Good for addressing key issues like border security, deficits, and debt. They highlighted the alarming rise in the U.S. deficit, with a May deficit of $347 billion suggesting an annual deficit potentially reaching $3.5 trillion. Brat pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) underestimated the deficit by 27%, primarily due to rising interest expenses. He criticized the CBO’s persistent rosy projections influenced by Wall Street’s preferences. Bannon and Brat underscored the severe economic challenges facing young adults, likening them to “new Russian serfs” due to financial mismanagement. Brat also noted that Goldman Sachs is betting against middle-class consumers, indicating a bleak outlook for the economy. They called for urgent action to curb government spending and restore fiscal responsibility, warning that the current trajectory threatens the nation’s economic stability and burdens future generations.  Steve Bannon emphasizes the urgent need for grassroots activism to counteract a system that erodes liberty and freedom. He frames the current state of affairs as a spiritual and materialistic battle over money and power. Bannon credits the American people for resurrecting Donald Trump politically against formidable opponents like Rachel Maddow and Merrick Garland. He views Trump’s actions as pivotal in saving the Republic from decline, preventing a potential takeover by forces like the Clintons in 2016 and challenging the outcome of the 2020 election. Bannon stresses the importance of American citizens reclaiming their centrality in national priorities, advocating for a shift away from policies that exploit the working and middle classes. He invokes the sacrifices of military personnel throughout history as a reminder of the values America should uphold, calling on citizens to embody the spirit of change necessary to reform the current system.  EJ Antoni and Steve Bannon discuss the dire economic situation facing the United States, emphasizing widespread deception by government institutions regarding job numbers and economic health. They criticize entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics for misleading the public with inflated job growth figures, which do not reflect reality. Bannon predicts that escalating deficits and debt will ultimately burden the middle class through either inflation or increased taxes, highlighting the systemic failures in fiscal management. Both stress the importance of grassroots activism and skepticism towards institutional narratives, urging Americans to reclaim their agency in shaping national policies. They argue that elites manipulate information to suit their agendas, undermining public trust and perpetuating economic inequality. Antoni condemns this manipulation as a betrayal of citizens who deserve transparency and accurate data to make informed decisions about their futures. The conversation underscores a call for accountability and a renewed focus on addressing systemic economic challenges through honest discourse and grassroots mobilization.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discuss Anthony Fauci’s latest book tour, criticizing Fauci for narcissism and using the tour to bolster his image and criticize President Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Winters highlights how Fauci portrays himself heroically while attacking figures like Peter Navarro, positioning his narrative as a cultural weapon against the MAGA movement. Bannon expresses disdain for Fauci’s perceived arrogance and misleading statements, referencing the metaphorical phrase “heads on pikes” as a criticism rather than a literal call to action. They anticipate dissecting Fauci’s falsehoods and media manipulation on their upcoming show, aiming to expose his inconsistencies and the media’s role in amplifying his narrative. Winters invites viewers to tune in for a critical analysis at 6 PM, emphasizing the need to challenge Fauci’s version of events and his influence on public perception.

Bannon criticizes the ruling class in America for prioritizing their own interests over those of the nation and its citizens. He sees a broken chain of passing down a better country through generations, lamenting how this ideal has been undermined by a ruling clique. Bannon asserts that a significant portion of the population is turning away from establishment figures like Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, whom he accuses of betraying American values for personal gain. He highlights a shift in political allegiance, where disillusioned Democrats are increasingly drawn to the populist movement, while dismissing the loss of establishment figures from their ranks as inconsequential. Additionally, Bannon challenges media narratives and calls for a reassessment of who accurately understands and communicates the nation’s challenges.  Bannon criticizes the ruling class in America for prioritizing their own interests over those of the nation and its citizens. He laments a broken tradition of passing down a stronger country through generations. Bannon accuses figures like Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy of lacking character and courage, particularly highlighting moments where he perceives them as abandoning critical fights. He asserts that media outlets like Fox News, by retaining figures like Ryan on their board, are complicit in undermining true American values and supporting the ruling class. Bannon calls for a reassessment of leadership in the Republican Party, emphasizing the need for genuine courage and commitment to the nation’s ideals.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed Anthony Fauci and the media’s treatment of him. Bannon highlighted Fauci’s role as a lightning rod for the Trump movement, criticizing how the media uses Fauci’s narrative to attack Trump. They argued that Fauci’s book and interviews are strategically timed to influence the 2024 election, portraying him heroically while vilifying Trump. Winters criticized the media for focusing on sensational aspects rather than substantive issues, suggesting that Fauci’s narrative is more about political maneuvering than public health. They also discussed Fauci’s connections and the broader skepticism around pandemic policies, implying a coordinated effort to discredit dissenting views as anti-science.  Natalie Winters critiques Anthony Fauci’s approach to media appearances and his book tour. She questions why Fauci opts for interviews with friendly hosts like Rachel Maddow and Stephen Colbert instead of engaging with more critical platforms like Bannon’s “War Room.” Winters suggests Fauci’s choices highlight a preference for controlled narratives over genuine dialogue. She also criticizes Fauci for shifting stances on critical issues such as the origins of COVID-19 and the efficacy of public health measures, accusing him of evasiveness and manipulation of facts. Winters implies that Fauci’s actions serve political agendas rather than the pursuit of scientific truth.

Mike Howell expressed strong criticism over the lack of effective action by Jim Jordan and others in Congress regarding defunding the DOJ, special counsel, and FBI. He described the efforts over the past year and a half as ineffective “Pen Pal games” with no real consequences for non-compliance by the current administration. Howell argued that merely talking about defunding at this late stage is absurd, given that significant concessions have already been made to President Biden. He suggested that Congress should appoint a legislative special counsel with substantial funding to take decisive action. Howell emphasized that the current measures, such as returning funds instead of utilizing them for investigations, are inadequate. He cited notable conservative legal figures advocating for more aggressive investigations into Democratic actions and criticized the lack of substantial responses to perceived abuses by the administration, including issues related to immigration and alleged political weaponization of institutions.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the significance and implications of a recent hearing featuring Dr. Anthony Fauci. They criticized the effectiveness of the hearing, suggesting it failed to adequately address key issues regarding the origins of COVID-19 and the involvement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Winters pointed out that many admissions made by Fauci, such as the arbitrary creation of the six-foot social distancing rule and the questionable efficacy and safety of vaccines, have long been suspected. Winters emphasized that despite bipartisan efforts, the hearing did not sufficiently expose deeper issues within the NIH or hold Fauci accountable. She argued that the pandemic was not due to incompetence but intentional actions, particularly by the Chinese Communist Party, and suggested that the NIH and Fauci were complicit. Bannon and Winters noted that the Democrats used the hearing to push for more pandemic prevention funding and mRNA vaccine development. At the same time, Republicans seemed more focused on creating viral moments rather than achieving substantive results. They also criticized establishment Republicans for not taking strong actions against China and for potentially using the hearing to protect Fauci and the status quo. Winters argued that the committee might be part of a cover-up operation, serving the establishment’s interests by using Peter Daszak as a scapegoat. Both Bannon and Winters expressed frustration with the hearing, seeing it as an insult to the intelligence of the American people and a missed opportunity to hold key figures accountable.  Steve Bannon and Dr. Bradley Thayer discussed the significance of the Tiananmen Square massacre and its broader implications. Thayer provided a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the massacre, emphasizing the brutal suppression of a pro-democracy movement by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He highlighted the CCP’s long history of suppressing dissent and the use of advanced technology to maintain control over the Chinese population. Thayer outlined several key lessons from the massacre, including the CCP’s willingness to use extreme measures to stay in power, the importance of democracy as an alternative to authoritarian rule, and the role of advanced technology in facilitating government control. He stressed the need for solidarity with the Chinese people in their struggle against CCP oppression. Bannon and Thayer expressed their commitment to commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and to raising awareness about the ongoing crisis in Taiwan. They also discussed upcoming discussions on related topics, such as the European parliamentary election and cybersecurity issues. Overall, the conversation underscored the continued relevance of Tiananmen Square as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and the importance of supporting democratic movements in China.  There’s confusion surrounding Biden’s approach to the Israel-Gaza conflict. While he’s been steadfast in other conflicts like Ukraine, calling for “as long as it takes,” he’s now pushing for an immediate end to the Israel-Gaza conflict, prompting questions about his motives. Hazony points out Biden’s three-stage plan, which lacks an aim to dismantle Hamas, the group behind the conflict. There’s concern that Biden’s rush for a ceasefire may stem from political expediency rather than strategic considerations. Additionally, there’s speculation about the stability of Netanyahu’s government amidst the crisis and potential implications for Israeli politics. Ultimately, Hazony warns of a misguided approach that may undermine long-term peace and stability in the region.  Raheem Kassam and Steve Bannon discussed the recent anti-Sharia protest in the UK, which Nigel Farage may view as a call for a more politically organized movement rather than just protests. They also highlighted the media’s suppression of incidents like the recent stabbing of a German police officer by a migrant, underscoring a pattern of normalization of such crimes by the political and media establishment. They emphasized the importance of outlets like the National Pulse for independent reporting and urged people to visit their website for truthful coverage.  Ben Harnwell and Steve Bannon discussed the UK’s Conservative Party’s complacency, highlighting its lack of genuine conservative values and the need for an alternative. They emphasized the urgency of dismantling the Tory party, which they perceived as co-opted by globalists. Transitioning to a discussion about America’s role in the global order, they explored why the prospect of a transactional approach under President Trump unnerves European elites. Bannon argued that America, once a beacon of liberty, has been compromised by its political class and now serves as a linchpin for the globalist order. They also touched upon the upcoming European parliamentary elections’ significance and coverage plans.

This is Natalie’s 4 year Anniversary on the WarRoom program! In the War Room interview, Naomi Wolf and Dave Brat discuss Steve Bannon’s incarceration and the consequences of lawfare. Wolf argues that Bannon’s imprisonment at Federal Correctional Institute Danbury aims to silence him, comparing it to historical examples of suppressing opposition. She warns that silencing Bannon sets a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to the suppression of other dissenters. Wolf emphasizes the need for collective action to oppose political imprisonment and protect liberty. Brat agrees, praising Wolf’s insights and noting the historical significance of defending individual freedoms. He questions why conservatives seem less effective at mobilizing than liberals, attributing it to conservatives’ individualism and an optimistic, sometimes naive, belief in America’s resilience. Wolf suggests a deeper awareness of historical dangers is necessary to defend liberty effectively. The conversation also touches on pharmaceutical industry issues, with Brat criticizing monopolistic practices and advocating for a truly free market. Wolf concludes by calling for continued support for Bannon and vigilance against threats to freedom. The interview highlights concerns about political persecution and the need for unified resistance.  In a conversation on the WarRoom, Mark Paoletta and Dave Brat discuss the unprecedented nature of President Biden’s recent attacks on the Supreme Court. Paoletta highlights that Biden’s public criticism of the Court and specific justices, such as Thomas and Alito, is unprecedented and dangerous, with historical comparisons only to isolated instances by former Presidents Obama and Nixon. Paoletta argues that Biden’s motivation is to gain approval from the “lunatic left” and outdo Obama, which he claims undermines the integrity of the Court. Paoletta also mentions the increased attacks on Justice Clarence Thomas by Biden and other Democrats, particularly regarding allegations of ethical violations. He notes that these attacks are part of a broader trend of undermining the Supreme Court’s authority and calls for lawyers who work with the Court to defend its integrity. Dave Brat ties these issues to a larger context of what he sees as Marxist deconstruction by the left, impacting not just the judiciary but multiple institutions. He criticizes the double standards in the application of justice, pointing out the lack of accountability for Democratic figures while Republicans face severe scrutiny and legal action. Brat and Paoletta also discuss Representative Anna Paulina Luna’s efforts to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for not complying with a subpoena related to recordings that might incriminate him in mishandling classified documents. They stress the need for accountability and urge their audience to pressure Republican representatives to support the contempt resolution. The conversation underscores a belief that current political attacks and legal actions are part of a broader, ideologically driven effort to undermine conservative figures and principles, necessitating a strong and organized response from conservative supporters.  Caroline Wren and Maureen Bannon discuss the recent arrest of an individual in Maricopa County who pleaded not guilty despite clear evidence of guilt. They highlight the suspicious timing of his trial, set for November 6th, the day after the general election. They speculate that his detention without bail until then is politically motivated to prevent him from speaking to the press. They question why someone with a history of theft was allowed near sensitive election materials and suggest he was paid to steal the key fobs for the Maricopa County tabulators. They argue this incident supports claims of election interference, especially given past issues with malfunctioning tabulators in Maricopa County. They call for continued investigation into the individual’s background and motives, asserting that this case exemplifies broader issues of electoral integrity.

In a conversation between Darren Beattie and Natalie Winters, the discussion centers on the political dynamics surrounding President Biden and Project 2025. Beattie and Winters suggest that the Democrats’ focus is primarily on criticizing Project 2025 and other social issues. Beattie expresses a preference for Project 2025 over the current administration’s policies, highlighting concerns about Biden’s leadership and the media’s role in shaping public perception. They delve into the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party, noting the speculation about Biden stepping down and the potential elevation of Kamala Harris. Beattie, a former Trump administration official, criticizes the media’s treatment of Biden, arguing that their recent criticisms are attempts to salvage their own credibility rather than improve the Democratic ticket’s prospects. Beattie emphasizes that the media’s lies and timing have placed the Democrats in a difficult position. He believes that replacing Biden now would invite chaos and further damage their chances in the 2024 election. The conversation highlights the media’s role in political narratives and the strategic challenges facing both parties.  Natalie Winters set out a call to action for people to call the US House about the failure to hold Merrick Garland accountable.  Mike Benz suggests that the Democrats will continue to use Russiagate to frame any pro-Trump, anti-Biden, or NATO-skeptical voices as potential threats backed by Russia. This strategy allows federal investigators to target and censor domestic influencers and political opponents, leveraging FISA and other tools. Benz notes the shift in focus from foreign to domestic disinformation and highlights the need for a perceived foreign threat to justify renewed social media censorship. He warns that the CIA’s actions will support this narrative, making it difficult for dissenting voices to operate freely online.  Mike McCormick, a former Biden staffer, discusses Joe Biden’s health decline and the internal conflict within the Democratic Party. He believes Biden, despite his decline, is determined to stay in office unless forced out by a higher power. McCormick identifies key figures in Biden’s inner circle, such as Steve Ricchetti and Tom Donilon, who support him. He highlights tensions between the Biden, Obama, and Clinton factions, suggesting that Biden might replace Kamala Harris with Hillary Clinton to secure party unity and fundraising support. McCormick also claims that Democrats are preparing a strategy involving ballot manipulation to ensure Biden’s re-election.  EJ Antoni criticizes the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for underreporting inflation, arguing that official statistics fail to reflect the real cost of living increases felt by Americans. He highlights discrepancies in health insurance and housing costs, noting that while BLS claims health insurance costs have dropped, real expenses have risen. Antoni also points out that mortgage payments on median-priced homes have surged 117% since Biden took office, contradicting BLS figures. This perceived underreporting makes Americans feel gaslighted as they struggle with higher costs for essentials like food, rent, and utilities. Antoni argues that the Biden administration’s economic messaging is out of touch, as many Americans face financial hardships. He asserts that this disconnect is influencing voting preferences, with the economy becoming a top priority for voters regardless of their political affiliation.  Jeff Clark and Ben Harnwell discussed the impeachment resolutions against Justices Thomas and Alito led by AOC. Clark explained these resolutions aim to intimidate justices and are unlikely to pass, lacking support and legislative viability. He criticized the resolutions as politically motivated attacks to make the justices’ lives difficult. Clark highlighted the resolutions’ sponsorship by prominent leftist House members and dismissed the allegations as baseless. He also shared his contact information and expressed readiness to provide future updates on the situation.  US Rep. Bob Good gave an update about the recount effort for his campaign.  Col. Harvey criticizes Democratic efforts to influence the Supreme Court by attempting to remove justices like Thomas and Alito. The GOP speaker argues that Democrats expect compliance with their agenda regardless of being in or out of power, using AOC’s impeachment resolution as an example. The speaker dismisses the likelihood of these resolutions passing, viewing them as political stunts aimed at intimidating the justices. They also discuss the improbability of such resolutions against judges on similar grounds, emphasizing the perceived abuses of power and political motives behind these actions. The speaker advocates for fair voting and criticizes NATO’s handling of the Ukraine conflict, attributing NATO’s recent vitality to Trump’s policies.

In a conversation between Dave Brat and Darren Beattie, they discussed the current tactics of the left in silencing opposition. Beattie argued that traditional methods like labeling opponents as racists or conspiracy theorists are less effective due to declining trust in the media. Consequently, the left has resorted to imprisoning political opponents, mentioning figures like Peter Navarro and Doug Mackey. Beattie suggested that such actions reflect the regime’s desperation and have backfired, strengthening public support for patriotism. Brat highlighted recent shifts in media messaging, particularly noting the New York Times’ inconsistent stance and the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party. Beattie elaborated on the complexities of replacing Biden, emphasizing that despite media hostility, influential Democrats are unlikely to oust him due to intertwined career interests and the risks involved. They concluded that Biden is likely to remain in place, but the Democrats face significant challenges. The discussion underscored the dynamic between media narratives and political strategy, with Brat and Beattie predicting continued turmoil within the Democratic ranks and the importance of alternative media like the War Room in providing accurate information.  In a conversation between Dave Brat and Jeff Clark on the War Room, Jeff Clark reacted to a clip featuring Bill Barr laughing about Steve Bannon being sent to prison. Clark expressed disappointment at Barr’s reaction, emphasizing the gravity of a former attorney general showing delight at someone’s imprisonment, especially a former top advisor to the president. He discussed the Supreme Court’s recent decision on presidential immunity, noting the mainstream media’s meltdown over the ruling and explaining that the decision reinforces the president’s authority to investigate and prosecute under the Constitution. Clark highlighted the ruling’s implications for the Deep State, arguing that it disrupts the established system where career officials, predominantly Democrats, controlled these decisions. He noted that the president now has reaffirmed control over such matters, causing significant concern among those officials. Dave Brat asked Clark about the media’s potential reactions and the significance of the ruling. Clark dismissed the media’s comparisons to extreme hypotheticals, emphasizing that the ruling aligns with the original constitutional framework and does not introduce new laws. He asserted that this ruling marks a return to the principles of the Constitution, challenging the post-constitutional era that began during the Progressive Era and intensified after Nixon. Clark further elaborated on the Supreme Court’s clarification of presidential immunity, explaining that official acts, such as the president’s speech on January 6th, should be protected. He argued that President Trump’s speech that day, urging people to peacefully and patriotically express their views, was an official act deserving of immunity. In conclusion, Clark encouraged listeners to support actions upholding the Constitution, such as calling on Congress to void the January 6th Committee’s subpoenas, including those leading to Bannon’s imprisonment.  In a conversation on the War Room, Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Polling discussed recent polling data with Dave Brat. The focus was on the aftermath of a debate and its impact on Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s standings. Mitchell noted a significant public concern about the country’s stability, with 41% of people fearing a potential civil war. Mitchell highlighted key recent events, such as a guilty verdict and a poor debate performance by Biden, which affected his approval ratings. Two months ago, Biden’s approval was 40%, with Trump leading him by 10 points. After the debate and other events, Biden’s approval briefly rose to 45%, reducing Trump’s lead to 5 points. However, Trump has since regained his lead, now at plus nine in head-to-head matchups. In their latest polling, Trump led Biden by 9 points, with 49% support for Trump and 40% for Biden. In a multi-way matchup, Trump’s lead increased to 10 points. Mitchell reported that 70% of voters watched most or all of the debate, with 56% declaring Trump the winner compared to 21% for Biden. Among Democrats, only 46% believed Biden won, and 24% thought Trump did. Post-debate, Biden’s approval among independents dropped to 34%, with overall approval falling to 28%, the lowest in two months. Mitchell concluded that the Democrats have returned to the difficult situation they faced in May, and Biden’s approval might dip further. He suggested that the Trump campaign should focus on winning down-ballot races, as inflation and the economy remain top concerns for voters.  Maureen Bannon, in her comments, emphasizes the importance of spreading the message of the “War Room” show and its content. She urges viewers to encourage their friends to watch the show and to open their eyes to the information being shared. She also mentions that despite her father, Steve Bannon, being in prison, his voice will still be heard through the show and its platforms. The message is clear: the “War Room” and its mission will not be silenced, and the show will continue to be a platform for sharing information and ideas.  Founder of Moms for Liberty, Tiffany Justice, talked to Natalie Winters about the schedule of events they have over the summer for people to get involved with their activism to support and defend parent rights and various campaigns.  In a discussion on War Room, Ben Harnwell highlighted Steve Bannon’s deep understanding of the system from his time in the Navy, the Pentagon, and Goldman Sachs, noting that Bannon’s insights have equipped the MAGA movement to fight against the very institutions where he first found success. Harnwell described Bannon as a “class traitor” not to the Republic or America but to establishments like Goldman Sachs and the military-industrial complex. He also discussed the significant political shift in France, where the National Rally saw increased support following the European elections, despite President Macron’s strategy to label them as far-right and present an ultimatum to voters. Harnwell emphasized the National Rally’s strict stance on immigration, distinguishing them from traditional elites and preventing them from being labeled far-left, despite their socialist and protectionist policies. He underscored that the elites are determined to bring in as many people from the third world into the West as possible, viewing this as an existential issue that only the people can stop.

In a conversation on the War Room, Jeff Clark discussed the dismissal of a significant classified documents case, involving for President Donald Trump. Clark praised Judge Cannon’s ruling, calling it a monumental decision that highlighted the unconstitutionality of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office under the appointments clause. Clark argued that Smith’s appointment violated the law because, unlike regular U.S. attorneys, he did not undergo Senate confirmation. Clark emphasized the thoroughness of Judge Cannon’s 93-page opinion, which addressed the unconstitutional appointment and Smith’s misuse of public funds. He also noted that the depth of her ruling proved critics of Cannon wrong. Natalie Winters inquired about the broader implications of this ruling on Trump’s legal battles and his opponents’ strategies. Clark and Mike pointed out that Trump’s opponents are unlikely to give up and will continue their efforts against him. They emphasized the need for Trump’s supporters to defend him against these tactics. Clark also criticized that the Justice Department operates independently of the President, arguing that it should be under presidential oversight. He attributed the flawed special counsel regulations from the Clinton administration to Neil Katyal and reiterated the need for constitutional adherence in creating government offices. Clark concluded by providing information on how to follow his work and stay updated with his writings and the Center for Renewing America.  Natalie Winters and Brian Glen discussed the kickoff of the RNC convention in Milwaukee, emphasizing the need for heightened security due to threats from leftist groups. They stressed the importance of supporting Trump’s 2024 campaign to defeat various enemies, including communists and globalists. Glen recounted his experience at a recent Trump rally where an assassination attempt on Trump occurred. Despite the heavy security presence, the event highlighted significant security lapses, with local police being blamed. The discussion also covered the transformation of the RNC into a MAGA-focused entity, celebrating the influence of Trump’s movement. They criticized the Biden administration for security failures and incompetence. The segment concluded with a tribute to veterans and a call to support the Disabled American Veterans organization.  In Milwaukee for the RNC Convention, Ben Bergquam interviews Republican Congressman Burgess Owens, discussing their enthusiasm for the event and President Trump’s 2024 campaign. Owens highlights the significance of the convention, emphasizing Trump’s defiance, courage, and love for America. They address the recent assassination attempt on Trump, critiquing media figures like Joy Reid for inciting violence with their rhetoric. Owens asserts that Americans, tired of negativity and division, are yearning for unity and hope, which Trump embodies. He believes the media’s bias has led to their loss of credibility and that Americans are now holding them accountable for their dishonesty. Owens expresses optimism for the future, predicting victories in the House and Senate and a Trump presidency, which he believes will bring positive policy changes and a renewed sense of hope. Bergquam notes the shift in support from black and Hispanic communities towards Trump, which Owens attributes to a desire for freedom and a positive future. Owens concludes by praising the influx of America First legislators in Congress, reflecting a broader movement towards traditional American values and unity.  Mike Davis joins Natalie Winters to discuss the recent legal victory for President Trump. Judge Eileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Trump, ruling that the special counsel’s office is unconstitutional. Davis explains that the U.S. Constitution requires new officers or taxpayer money spending to be approved by Congress, which wasn’t done in this case. He emphasizes that Congress allowed the independent counsel statute to lapse after the Ken Starr investigation of Clinton, but the Justice Department attempted to bypass this by creating the special counsel’s office through regulation. This office operates with little oversight and an unlimited budget, which Cannon deemed unconstitutional. Davis believes the Biden Justice Department may attempt to bring the case again through a U.S. attorney who is appropriately appointed and confirmed. Jeff Clark joins via Skype, calling the ruling monumental and praising Cannon for her detailed 93-page opinion. He criticizes the media for previously dismissing concerns about the special counsel’s constitutionality and highlights Justice Thomas’s concurrence in a related case as influential in Cannon’s decision. Clark argues that the Justice Department’s actions represent an unconstitutional overreach, reminiscent of historical grievances against the British monarchy. Davis and Clark agree that Trump’s opponents won’t relent despite this setback, predicting continued legal and political challenges. They stress the importance of defending Trump against what they see as politically motivated lawfare. Davis also discusses his role in helping draft a streamlined America First RNC platform, emphasizing its appeal to a broad coalition of voters.  Natalie Winters and Matt Taylor discuss the upcoming film “Government Gangsters,” set to debut this week at the RNC, which highlights the influence of career bureaucrats, termed as the “Deep State,” within U.S. government agencies. The film, based on Kash Patel’s book, aims to expose the deep state’s use of a two-tier justice system against figures like Donald Trump, and events such as Russiagate and the Hunter Biden laptop saga. Taylor, who played a key role in the film’s creation, expresses excitement for its s
