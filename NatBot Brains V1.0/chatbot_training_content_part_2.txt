Mike Lindell talked about lawfare and pillows- and offered a special deal to the WarRoom audience. Jack Posobiec talked about the nationalist-populist movement in Spain. Suggested watching: Weaponization hearing The strategic Common Man CPI, focusing on essentials like food, energy, shelter, clothing, utilities, and insurance, has shown a consistent increase, surpassing official numbers for 9 months straight. Gold has risen in 34 of the last 40 months, indicating inflation as a significant concern. This suggests that inflation is no longer a campaign issue and that Biden may have lost ground on it. EJ Antoni emphasizes that the real impact on Americans’ lives is more severe than the headline numbers suggest, especially in housing costs, which have surged far beyond what official statistics reflect.  Rep. Plaskett spoke at the weaponization hearing and said that President Trump demands absolute loyalty from all his followers and especially from GOP officials and those who work for him.   She pouted that many Americans have flocked to New York City to demonstrate their allegiance, standing with him despite the ongoing investigations. Plaskett moaned that Trump expects every Republican official to use their positions to aid his legal defense, even as criticism mounts, decrying his loyalists, including Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, for openly mocking Republican leaders who they feel aren’t doing enough to defend Trump. Plaskett told the committee that the WarRoom demands action, not just words, insisting that the federal government should actively protect Trump from legal repercussions.   She added that Trump’s supporters in the media echo these sentiments, pressuring Republican leaders to act decisively in Trump’s defense.  Bob Costello told the Weaponization Committee that he was the attorney for the Southern District of New York and denied representing Donald Trump or any of his associates despite having represented other high-profile individuals.

He highlights the process of appointing a committee to choose the flag design and criticizes the lack of transparency and public input in the decision-making. Turbo argues that the adoption of this flag symbolizes a shift in the state’s identity and questions the Republican Party’s response to the issue, attributing it to Democratic dominance in Minnesota.  Gene Hamilton testified and emphasized the importance of action in pursuing justice and morality to counteract the negative impacts of human ambition. He talked about the founding principles of the American system, emphasizing the need for a strong but not omnipotent federal government that respects individual liberties and prevents tyranny. However, he expresses concern about the current concentration of power in the federal government, particularly under President Biden’s leadership, and suggests that this concentration leads to political persecution and division.

Cold Open was footage of Speaker Mike Johnson and Majorie Taylor Greene separately talking about and reacting to the day’s events over a potential motion to vacate. Highlights: Julie Kelly Broke the news that Judge Cannon won’t set a new date and hold hearings on Jack Smith. Andrew Giuliani talked about the New York City Trial of Donald Trump. Todd Bensman spoke about his article in the New York Post. Mike Davis talked about how to end lawfare against Republicans. Kash Patel spoke about the Jan. 6th, 2021 National Guard Scandal Reccomended Reading: Why Biden’s Gaza refugee plan is a hard hell no Andrew Giuliani’s Twitter Feed Full show in segments: Julie Kelly reports breaking news in the classified documents case. Judge Alien Cannon has vacated the May 20th trial date and is refusing to set a new one, citing prudence. Instead, she plans to hold key hearings that will likely trouble Jack Smith, Trump’s co-defendant. These hearings include motions to dismiss based on selective and vindictive prosecution, the unlawful appointment of Jack Smith, and a partial evidentiary hearing on the scope of the prosecution team. Cannon’s actions indicate a serious approach to the case, putting pressure on Smith and his team to explain their actions. The burden on Cannon to uncover evidence highlights the lack of oversight from institutions like the House Judiciary Committee. Kelly’s detailed reporting provides crucial insights into the case’s developments.  Andrew Giuliani reports on a tumultuous day in Manhattan court, where a street brawl erupted during proceedings. Giuliani describes the trial as a smear campaign against Donald Trump, with Stormy Daniels’ testimony veering off course. The trial has become highly prejudicial despite the judge’s attempts to rein in the prosecution’s salacious details. Giuliani highlights Stormy Daniels’ admission of a monetary motive, a pivotal moment in the defense’s case. The prosecution’s insistence on including such details suggests a desire to shame Trump rather than focus on factual evidence. Overall, Giuliani emphasizes the biased nature of the trial and the media’s complicity in sensationalizing it.  Today on the show, there was a heated discussion about the Biden administration’s proposal to bring Gaza war refugees into the United States. Todd Bensman, a prominent figure in counterterrorism, highlighted the dangers of such a move, arguing that bringing individuals from an environment of anti-American indoctrination and hostility towards the US would pose significant security risks. He emphasized the need for congressional action to prevent this proposal from being realized. Todd’s insights were shared in an article published in the New York Post, and you can find more of his work on his website and social media channels. Mentioned: Why Biden’s Gaza refugee plan is a hard hell no  Today’s show featured a promotion for My Pillow products, including the My Pillow and various other items like slippers, sandals, and socks. The host highlighted the quality of the products, particularly praising the USA socks as the best he’s ever worn. He also mentioned special deals available, such as discounts on bulk purchases and buy-one-get-one-free offers. Listeners were encouraged to take advantage of these specials by calling the provided phone number.  Natalie Winters talked about corporate media and vaccine injuries from her investigations.  Mike Davis is expressing frustration with the lack of action and defense from Republican politicians regarding various legal issues surrounding former President Trump. He highlights the lack of resistance against Democratic prosecutors and expresses disappointment in the absence of a strong fight, contrasting it with past battles like the confirmation of Supreme Court justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Davis emphasizes the pivotal role of key figures such as President Trump, Don McGann, Mitch McConnell, Mark Paoletta, and himself in ensuring Kavanaugh’s confirmation despite significant opposition. He criticizes many Republican politicians for not showing the same level of commitment and urges them to step up and defend their party’s interests.  The conversation discusses the recent New York Times article confirming that former President Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard before January 6th. This revelation contradicts the narrative that Trump refused to authorize the National Guard. Instead, it was other individuals, including Bowser and Pelosi, who reportedly delayed the deployment. The discussion highlights the chain of command and how certain officials allegedly obstructed Trump’s orders. The conversation criticizes those involved for their actions and calls for accountability. Additionally, it suggests that this information exonerates Trump from any insurrection charges. The conversation ends with a call for further investigation and emphasizes the importance of revealing the truth to the American people.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests.

The cold open was Joe Biden, looking and sounding very feeble and weak, talking about the economy, juxtaposed with commentary about Trump’s economy and foreshadowing by Hillary on MSNBC talking about Trump. MTG’s motion to vacate footage, with the Uni-party booing. “We should call the bluffs of people right now and find out now. This is the great unmasking.

Steve Stern talked about the Precinct Project. Eli Crane spoke about why he supported MTG’s motion to vacate. Adam Molan talked about his new article covering Peter Navarro. Brody Mullins talked about his new book. US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked about her motion to vacate on Thursday. Full show in segments: Natalie Winters and Steve Bannon open the program with cold open footage that shows Democrat Joe Biden speaking about President Trump and the economy in a very low-energy voice, making bold statements.  Democrat Hillary Clinton is seen in the footage compilation as well, which causes Steve Bannon to rip apart and expose decades of corruption by both Hillary and Bill Clinton that happened during all of their years in public service.  Steve Stern heads up the discussion about the powerful Precinct Project, giving details of the next group call for all interested parties who would like encouragement and instruction on how to get into their local parties and get control away from RINOS.  Stern talked about his upcoming birthday celebration and some of the newest campaigns the group is working on, including getting writers in every state to start newsletters to inform the public of the action they are taking.  US Rep. Eli Crane talked about his motivations for supporting US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on her motion to vacate the Speaker’s chair on Wednesday, and he spoke about the importance of what Greene was doing regarding saving the Republic. Crane told Bannon that his constituents in AZ supported him and the stand he took and that the disconnect was between the people and the Reps who voted with the Uniparty.  US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked to Steve Bannon about her motion to vacate, reconfirming that she felt it was the right thing to do to expose the power in DC and how the other reps who make up the uni party are not listening to the concerns of the people.  She disagreed with others who said her actions were dangerous to the Republican majority.  Brody Mullins talked about his new book, the Wolves of K Street, and gave Steve Bannon a preview of the secret history of how big money took over the big government and formed an almost unbeatable alliance.  The little guys are not represented at all anymore, which is the feeling of the average American, and the people with money, as described, seem to get all the breaks.  Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock talked to Steve Bannon about the very scary reality of a woman who lost her home after the title was stolen.  A woman went through legal battles to rescue and salvage what was left of her property after a thief stole her home.  Adam Molon makes his case to Steve Bannon about why he wants President Trump to choose Peter Navarro for his running mate for the 2024 Presidential elections.  Molon wrote a piece for Epoch Times outlining his point of view and discussed with Bannon.

Steve Bannon, Dave Brat, and Natalie Winters discussed Republican resistance efforts on Capitol Hill, highlighting legal and bureaucratic obstacles. They noted that establishment forces are using lawsuits and liberal courts to slow down conservative initiatives. A key focus was dismantling the FBI and USAID, which they claim funds left-wing agendas, including suppressing conservative media, supporting the southern border crisis, and covert operations in Ukraine. Winters emphasized the scale of opposition, mentioning a 50,000-strong mobilization. Bannon framed the fight as an all-out offensive, using wartime metaphors. They also touched on concerns regarding data mining and AI in government operations. The discussion underscored conservative frustration with entrenched institutions and their determination to overhaul the system.
Steve Bannon outlined key Republican priorities, emphasizing the need for strategic execution. He framed the political battle as a structured process, requiring discipline before achieving larger victories. Bannon identified three major objectives: ending U.S. involvement in global conflicts (particularly Ukraine and the Middle East), addressing mass illegal immigration through “nasty partitions” to remove millions of migrants since 2021, and tackling the financial crisis driven by $36 trillion in national debt.
He criticized excessive federal spending, advocating for targeted tax reforms that benefit middle-class entrepreneurs rather than corporations. While supporting defense spending, he argued for a strategic overhaul to prevent self-inflicted economic harm. He highlighted Trump’s “geo-economic and geostrategic” vision, focusing on protectionism and hemispheric defense.
Bannon also referenced internal Republican debates over budget cuts, particularly leading up to a March 14 deadline that could determine whether Trump shuts down his own government. He framed these financial battles as existential, warning of elite corruption and unchecked spending.
Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discussed key financial and political issues, focusing on government spending, fiscal policy, and economic control. Bannon highlighted Jason Turner’s appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets, emphasizing its significance. Brat, known for his economic expertise, shared complex mathematical analyses regarding financial trends.
Bannon underscored concerns about excessive government spending, deficits, and inflation. He noted that gold prices hit an all-time high due to the weakening dollar, attributing the decline in purchasing power to reckless federal expenditures. Bill Ackman and Elon Musk’s perspectives were cited, reinforcing the argument that current deficit levels are unsustainable. Bannon stressed the need for spending cuts and budget restructuring, explaining that Trump’s administration would approach financial control through executive actions, including delaying payments and reallocating funds.
The discussion also touched on legislative challenges, particularly the Republican Party’s struggle to push serious budget reforms. Concerns over fragmented efforts in the Senate and donor-driven decision-making were highlighted, with emphasis on border security and tax cuts. Bannon warned that Democrats, despite current setbacks, still have significant resources, including media influence.
He concluded by discussing Trump’s financial strategy, suggesting that controlling spending requires firm executive action. He argued that the judiciary would ultimately decide the extent of executive power in financial restructuring. Overall, the conversation reflected deep frustration with Washington’s fiscal mismanagement and a call for aggressive reforms.
Jim Rickards and Steve Bannon discussed the dire situation in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a strategic shift. Rickards criticized Ukraine’s current approach, including Zelensky’s demands for more aid and military support, and questioned the effectiveness of NATO’s involvement. He warned against the continued supply of ineffective weapons, like Abrams tanks and F-16s, which have failed on the battlefield. Rickards argued that Ukraine has lost the war and suggested that the U.S. should stop escalating the conflict. He proposed three options: accept Putin’s terms, continue fighting for better terms (which he deemed unlikely), or escalate to World War III. He advised that President Trump could end the war quickly with a phone call, but feared that advisors might push for a prolonged conflict to secure better terms.
Rickards recommended cutting bait now, negotiating directly with Putin, and telling Zelensky the terms. He also criticized Zelensky’s leadership, calling him a military dictator rather than a democratic leader. Bannon agreed with Rickards’ assessment, emphasizing the importance of a free-market system in Ukraine and rejecting elitist interventions that hinder economic growth. Bannon also highlighted Ukraine’s Christian values, suggesting a more balanced approach to foreign policy, focusing on economic independence rather than globalist agendas. Finally, they briefly touched on the financial situation and upcoming changes in the U.S. Treasury, with Rickards promoting his new book, Money GPT, addressing AI’s impact on financial markets and global conflict.
Part One:
Part Two:
Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discuss the current financial crisis and the challenges facing Congress in managing the budget. Bannon highlights the looming debt ceiling and the need for immediate action, stressing the importance of addressing tax issues and warning against ignoring letters from the IRS. He emphasizes the urgency of fiscal reform, particularly in light of the growing deficit and the inability of Congress to act effectively. Brat reflects on the unsustainable increase in federal spending, pointing out that the budget has grown from $4.5 trillion in 2019 to $6.5 trillion, without addressing the long-term debt problem. He advocates for imposing fiscal rules that would constrain government spending and limit deficits. Both express frustration with the lack of leadership in Congress, particularly in the House, and the failure to move forward on appropriations bills. They criticize the Senate’s inaction and call for stronger political will to tackle the fiscal crisis. Bannon also touches on the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy, warning that it could further enrich the wealthy while hurting the middle class. In closing, both agree that leadership and a unified approach are needed to address these pressing fiscal challenges.

Steve Bannon and Carrie Sheffield discussed the significance of recent victories in protecting women’s sports from transgender participation, framing it as a pivotal moment in exposing the left’s stance on women’s rights. Bannon recalled Sheffield’s early warnings about the issue, which were initially met with skepticism but have since proven accurate. Sheffield described the ruling as an “earthquake” and a “restoration of women’s rights,” highlighting how the left has shown indifference to women’s safety and fairness in sports.
Sheffield criticized the Democratic Party for abandoning the feminist principles it once championed, arguing that its refusal to define “woman” has led to an inability to defend women’s rights. She framed the issue as part of a broader ideological battle between truth and disorder. Bannon echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that the struggle extends beyond politics into fundamental moral and cultural conflicts.
They also addressed the Biden administration’s attempt to rewrite Title IX, accusing it of undermining the protections originally intended to ensure fairness for female athletes. While celebrating state-level victories, Sheffield stressed the need for federal protections to prevent funding from supporting schools that allow transgender athletes in women’s sports. She dismissed leftist claims that only privileged suburban girls care about the issue, arguing that it’s about upholding objective truth and foundational values.
Steve Bannon and Terry Shilling discussed the broader implications of the transgender movement on feminism, gender identity, and federal policies. Shilling recalled initial skepticism when the issue of biological men competing in women’s sports was first raised. He emphasized that the feminist left has been largely absent or complicit in the movement because their ultimate goal is to erase gender distinctions altogether.
Shilling argued that this agenda seeks to create an androgynous society where men and women are indistinguishable, making people easier to control. He pointed out that the growing “gender industry” is a multi-billion-dollar business, heavily funded by taxpayer dollars through Medicaid and state funding, and that the push to normalize gender transitions has led to both adults and children being subjected to medical procedures.
Bannon and Shilling agreed that Trump has successfully exposed this issue to the public, making it a top concern for swing voters. They stressed the importance of holding politicians accountable, forcing Democrats to take a public stance on whether biological men should compete in women’s sports. The issue remains a “live fire exercise,” with the potential to drive uncomfortable but necessary conversations that could shift electoral outcomes.
Natalie Winters reported from the WHite House and talked about the latest details of the Trump’s administration’s moves on USAID and the reaction from the Democrats.
Steve Bannon and Todd Bensman discussed several critical issues, focusing on border security, supply chains, and geopolitical tensions. Bensman noted that under Trump, illegal crossings at the southern border had dropped significantly to around 400-500 per day due to detentions, expulsions, and deportations. He emphasized that Mexico was now dealing with the brunt of the migrant crisis, as U.S. policies deterred crossings. He argued that securing the border was a matter of enforcing existing laws rather than requiring new legislation.
Bannon and Bensman also discussed the role of the military in maintaining border security, stressing that continued enforcement was necessary to prevent a resurgence in illegal immigration. Bensman highlighted the shift in immigration policy, with fewer illegal crossings and increased deportations, particularly through flights to countries like India, China, and Colombia.
Additionally, Bannon touched on supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly regarding pharmaceuticals, which remain heavily dependent on China. He urged preparedness, promoting Jace Medical as a solution for securing essential medicines. The conversation reflected broader concerns about national security, economic independence, and the effectiveness of Trump’s policies in addressing these challenges.

US Rep. Andy Biggs and Steve Bannon discussed the recent historic decision by the House of Representatives to hold the US Attorney General in contempt of Congress. This rare event, only the third in US history, occurred due to the Attorney General’s failure to comply with subpoenas from three committees despite numerous opportunities provided. Biggs highlighted the importance of obtaining audio recordings from interviews conducted by Special Counsel Robert Hur with Joe Biden and his biographer, which reportedly contain evidence of Biden’s mishandling of classified information. Biggs criticized Hur’s decision not to prosecute Biden, citing concerns about Biden’s memory and the potential sympathy of a jury. The Congressman emphasized the need to review the audio tapes to verify the validity of Hur’s prosecutorial discretion and to consider impeachment proceedings against Biden. Biggs argued that the Department of Justice’s refusal to release the tapes suggests a political cover-up and insisted that Congress has the constitutional right to access the evidence. The discussion also covered the procedural next steps, including the possibility of appointing a special House counsel to pursue civil action if necessary. Biggs stressed the need for aggressive oversight and accountability, particularly in light of the perceived weaponization of the federal government against conservatives. He called for more assertive actions to restore balance and ensure the rule of law.   Julie Kelly, speaking with Steve Bannon, praised the House Republicans and leadership for holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, marking only the third time this has happened. Kelly emphasized that this action will draw public attention to Garland’s refusal to release the audio recordings of Joe Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. She argued that this is among the least of Garland’s offenses, citing his history of weaponizing the Justice Department against figures like Donald Trump and January 6th protesters. Kelly criticized the Justice Department’s handling of the classified documents case in Florida, describing it as corrupt and sloppy. She mentioned the mishandling of evidence during the Mar-A-Lago raid, including alleged doctoring of photos and improper handling of privileged communications. Bannon and Kelly discussed the parallels between Biden’s situation and Trump’s, suggesting the Biden audio tapes must be damaging for Garland to risk contempt charges. Additionally, Kelly highlighted Garland’s attempts to conceal evidence, including January 6th security footage, which Republicans are now making public. She underscored Garland’s double standards and his efforts to shield critical information from the American people. The conversation briefly touched on the ongoing legal proceedings involving Trump, including motions to dismiss the Mar-A-Lago case due to alleged mishandling and falsification of the search warrant.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the recent decision to hold US Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, highlighting it as a significant and overdue step. Winters expressed satisfaction with the move but stressed that many more individuals need to be held accountable, such as the 51 intelligence officers who she claims lied. She criticized the current process of private depositions and slow release of information, advocating for public hearings with meaningful questions. Winters argued that House Republicans must push for real accountability and avoid the limited actions that only give the appearance of progress. She drew attention to what she perceives as a double standard, where Republicans face harsher scrutiny for defying Congressional subpoenas compared to Democrats. Bannon and Winters agreed that what is needed is not retribution but justice.  Mike Lindell and Steve Bannon discussed recent developments in the recall effort against Robin Voss in Wisconsin. Lindell announced that a significant legal filing had been made by lawyer Kevin Scott, which mandates the Wisconsin Election Commission to set the recall election for July 9th. Lindell emphasized the importance of this recall, stating that Voss has blocked numerous efforts to secure election integrity and reforms, particularly those addressing issues from the 2020 election. Removing Voss, according to Lindell, would open doors for the MAGA movement and broader Republican efforts in Wisconsin. The conversation then shifted briefly to promotional deals on Lindell’s products, including discounts on mattresses with a six-month money-back guarantee and a 10-year warranty. Lindell urged viewers to take advantage of these deals by visiting his website or calling a provided phone number.  In their discussion, Steve Bannon and EJ Antoni reviewed the latest inflation figures and their impact on American consumers. Antoni noted that while the inflation rate has slowed to 3.3%, prices are still rising faster than wages, causing a decline in purchasing power. He criticized the accuracy of government metrics, particularly in areas like health insurance, which do not reflect the real experiences of most Americans. Antoni emphasized that many Americans are financially worse off, as indicated by various polls. Bannon and Antoni then discussed the economic impact of the increasing number of illegal immigrants, arguing that while these immigrants contribute to production, they also incur significant costs (e.g., using emergency rooms and public schools without adequately contributing to tax revenues). They highlighted that consumer spending, a major component of GDP, has turned negative, suggesting a potential decline in GDP for the second quarter. The conversation also touched on the high levels of consumer credit card debt, which exceeds $1 trillion, with rising default rates. Antoni explained that many consumers have maxed out their credit and are struggling to maintain their standard of living. They drew parallels between consumer reliance on credit and government borrowing strategies, noting that both are unsustainable in the long term. Antoni pointed out that real-life costs, such as homeownership, have increased far more than official metrics indicate. He highlighted that the net job growth has largely gone to foreign workers since the pandemic, with fewer native-born Americans employed today than before February 2020. To follow Antoni’s economic analysis, Bannon recommended his Twitter feed and Heritage Foundation’s website.  Steve Bannon and Malachy Steenson discussed the rise of nationalist and populist movements in Europe, particularly focusing on the European Parliamentary elections. Bannon highlighted the significant role of figures like Nigel Farage in the UK and the activities of nationalist parties across France and Germany. He emphasized the importance of following these movements closely. Steenson provided an in-depth look at the situation in Ireland, emphasizing the country’s historical commitment to sovereignty and nationalism. He criticized the current political class in Ireland for their alignment with the European Union and their handling of immigration issues. Steenson highlighted the significant impact of recent immigration policies on local communities, particularly the strain on housing and public services. Both Bannon and Steenson expressed concern over the erosion of national identity and sovereignty due to the influence of the EU and the influx of migrants. Steenson pointed out the unsustainability of current immigration levels given Ireland’s limited infrastructure and resources. He noted the revival of nationalist sentiment in Ireland, driven by the perceived betrayal of the political class and the pressure from increasing immigration. They discussed the potential for a general election in Ireland, speculating it might occur later this year. Steenson emphasized the need for a grassroots nationalist movement to reclaim Ireland’s sovereignty and protect its cultural identity for future generations. Bannon underscored the importance of such movements globally, noting similar sentiments rising in various countries.  Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell discussed significant political developments in the United States and Europe, emphasizing the rise of nationalist and populist movements. Bannon highlighted concerns about political threats, referencing comments from Kash Patel and criticisms from “Morning Joe,” stressing the seriousness of threats from political opponents. They criticized Donald Trump’s character and suitability for a second term, pointing to his authoritarian tendencies and disregard for constitutional norms. Harnwell updated on political shifts in France, noting Eric Ciotti’s support for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, a major change in French politics that challenges traditional separations between mainstream and nationalist parties. This potential collaboration could significantly impact European politics, particularly in the upcoming European elections, reflecting a broader trend of growing nationalist influence. Additionally, Harnwell emphasized the importance of grassroots support and engagement, highlighting the enthusiasm of MAGA supporters and noting that interventions from establishment figures like Paul Ryan only galvanize this base. Overall, the discussion underscored the increasing influence of nationalist and populist movements, the shifts in political alliances, and their potential impact on future elections and governance.

(Originally aired 6/18) In a discussion with Steve Bannon on the WarRoom program, attorney Cleta Mitchell expressed concerns about election integrity in Georgia, attributing issues to a deep state within election offices nationwide. Mitchell traced the origins back to a 2013 declaration by left-wing leaders to spend millions altering America’s political system, focusing on election processes, campaign finance laws, and judicial confirmations. Mitchell highlighted significant financial investments by leftist billionaires and foundations since 2013, estimating $11-14 billion spent to transform voting methods. She described a deep state within election offices that trains and indoctrinates officials, creating a robust infrastructure for mail-in voting.  Steve Bannon lambasted the mainstream media, particularly targeting Rachel Maddow. He mocked Maddow’s emotional responses and predicted advertisers would flee from her show due to their unpopular stance. Bannon also derided accusations against Trump, calling the charges “phony” and criticizing left-wing efforts to portray Trump as a threat to democracy. Bannon praised “Project 2025,” a comprehensive 885-page plan prepared by conservatives, showcasing their readiness for the next election. He accused the Biden administration of being out of touch with American voters, blaming their radical policies and incompetence for losing public support. Bannon alleged that left-wing billionaires have spent billions to influence elections, describing this as an attack on democracy. He dismissed Maddow’s warnings about the end of democracy as out of touch, claiming that American voters see through the deception. Bannon emphasized the importance of grassroots movements and the working class, asserting that they are now aware of the misleading narratives pushed by the left. He concluded by predicting a political shift favoring conservatives in upcoming elections.  Steve Bannon commented on the failure of Kevin McCarthy’s political maneuvers, highlighting the defeat of McCarthy-backed candidates despite substantial financial support. Bannon criticized McCarthy’s strategy, emphasizing the deep unpopularity of his brand. He argued that only Donald Trump can lead the GOP, dismissing Ron DeSantis’s and Nikki Haley’s prospects as unrealistic. Bannon highlighted Trump’s unique role in the “American experience” and predicted his inevitable return to the presidency. Bannon also discussed the broader political landscape, expressing disdain for the establishment and media figures like Rachel Maddow. He claimed that the 2020 election “steal” was providential, revealing to Americans the corruption in the system. Bannon stressed that the MAGA movement, fueled by the working class, will not tolerate further deceit. Bannon mentioned ongoing issues like deficit spending and the handling of illegal immigration, asserting that the government is lying about the true costs. He promoted “Project 2025,” aimed at dismantling the administrative state. Bannon concluded by stating that the elite’s control is slipping, with the MAGA movement gaining momentum as Americans reject the current establishment.  John Solomon and Steve Bannon discussed documents revealing Hunter and Joe Biden’s alleged corruption involving Burisma. Solomon reported that Hunter Biden and his partners secured a deal to funnel $120 million from Burisma to a company in Liechtenstein, giving them a 25% stake in future revenue without any investment. This occurred just before Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma. Solomon highlighted that the FBI had these documents since 2016 but withheld them during Trump’s impeachment, which could have altered the proceedings had they been disclosed. The documents, obtained from Hunter’s business partner Devin Archer, show the influence-peddling scheme and the FBI’s awareness of it. Solomon criticized the FBI for not acting on this information, suggesting political motives. Bannon and Solomon questioned why the Obama administration, particularly FBI leaders like Comey and McCabe, didn’t address these issues, speculating that concerns about Joe and Hunter Biden’s activities were known but not acted upon to avoid political fallout. Solomon emphasized the importance of Congress demanding any briefings that Obama and Biden received about Hunter’s activities, asserting that this could clarify their awareness and inaction, making the scandal more comprehensible to the public.  Steve Bannon discussed the challenges facing the U.S. dollar and the implications of the recent CBO report, emphasizing the erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power. He highlighted that the BRICS nations are gaining geopolitical strength, particularly in Eurasia and Ukraine. Bannon criticized the U.S. government’s financial mismanagement, leading to massive deficits and a potential devaluation of government bonds, as evidenced by a Japanese bank’s decision to sell $61 billion in U.S. government securities. Bannon suggested that financial elites and hedge fund managers recognize the impending financial crisis, driving them to buy gold. He urged viewers to educate themselves on macroeconomics and capital markets to become self-reliant. Bannon also condemned the excessive government spending, which he termed as “human bondage,” benefiting only the elite while burdening the average American. He called for a change in management and more accountability, expressing support for political figures like Bob Good and Eli Crane, who oppose excessive spending. Bannon warned of a potential revolution if financial mismanagement continues, noting that younger generations are becoming increasingly aware and disillusioned with the current economic system. He emphasized the need for active participation and control to bring about change.  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discussed the negative impact of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s financial policies, criticizing his misleading claims of deficit reduction. Bannon emphasized that McCarthy’s long-term deficit reduction plans are deceptive, with no immediate spending cuts. Brat praised Bob Good for addressing key issues like border security, deficits, and debt. They highlighted the alarming rise in the U.S. deficit, with a May deficit of $347 billion suggesting an annual deficit potentially reaching $3.5 trillion. Brat pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) underestimated the deficit by 27%, primarily due to rising interest expenses. He criticized the CBO’s persistent rosy projections influenced by Wall Street’s preferences. Bannon and Brat underscored the severe economic challenges facing young adults, likening them to “new Russian serfs” due to financial mismanagement. Brat also noted that Goldman Sachs is betting against middle-class consumers, indicating a bleak outlook for the economy. They called for urgent action to curb government spending and restore fiscal responsibility, warning that the current trajectory threatens the nation’s economic stability and burdens future generations.  Steve Bannon emphasizes the urgent need for grassroots activism to counteract a system that erodes liberty and freedom. He frames the current state of affairs as a spiritual and materialistic battle over money and power. Bannon credits the American people for resurrecting Donald Trump politically against formidable opponents like Rachel Maddow and Merrick Garland. He views Trump’s actions as pivotal in saving the Republic from decline, preventing a potential takeover by forces like the Clintons in 2016 and challenging the outcome of the 2020 election. Bannon stresses the importance of American citizens reclaiming their centrality in national priorities, advocating for a shift away from policies that exploit the working and middle classes. He invokes the sacrifices of military personnel throughout history as a reminder of the values America should uphold, calling on citizens to embody the spirit of change necessary to reform the current system.  EJ Antoni and Steve Bannon discuss the dire economic situation facing the United States, emphasizing widespread deception by government institutions regarding job numbers and economic health. They criticize entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics for misleading the public with inflated job growth figures, which do not reflect reality. Bannon predicts that escalating deficits and debt will ultimately burden the middle class through either inflation or increased taxes, highlighting the systemic failures in fiscal management. Both stress the importance of grassroots activism and skepticism towards institutional narratives, urging Americans to reclaim their agency in shaping national policies. They argue that elites manipulate information to suit their agendas, undermining public trust and perpetuating economic inequality. Antoni condemns this manipulation as a betrayal of citizens who deserve transparency and accurate data to make informed decisions about their futures. The conversation underscores a call for accountability and a renewed focus on addressing systemic economic challenges through honest discourse and grassroots mobilization.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discuss Anthony Fauci’s latest book tour, criticizing Fauci for narcissism and using the tour to bolster his image and criticize President Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Winters highlights how Fauci portrays himself heroically while attacking figures like Peter Navarro, positioning his narrative as a cultural weapon against the MAGA movement. Bannon expresses disdain for Fauci’s perceived arrogance and misleading statements, referencing the metaphorical phrase “heads on pikes” as a criticism rather than a literal call to action. They anticipate dissecting Fauci’s falsehoods and media manipulation on their upcoming show, aiming to expose his inconsistencies and the media’s role in amplifying his narrative. Winters invites viewers to tune in for a critical analysis at 6 PM, emphasizing the need to challenge Fauci’s version of events and his influence on public perception.

Bannon criticizes the ruling class in America for prioritizing their own interests over those of the nation and its citizens. He sees a broken chain of passing down a better country through generations, lamenting how this ideal has been undermined by a ruling clique. Bannon asserts that a significant portion of the population is turning away from establishment figures like Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, whom he accuses of betraying American values for personal gain. He highlights a shift in political allegiance, where disillusioned Democrats are increasingly drawn to the populist movement, while dismissing the loss of establishment figures from their ranks as inconsequential. Additionally, Bannon challenges media narratives and calls for a reassessment of who accurately understands and communicates the nation’s challenges.  Bannon criticizes the ruling class in America for prioritizing their own interests over those of the nation and its citizens. He laments a broken tradition of passing down a stronger country through generations. Bannon accuses figures like Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy of lacking character and courage, particularly highlighting moments where he perceives them as abandoning critical fights. He asserts that media outlets like Fox News, by retaining figures like Ryan on their board, are complicit in undermining true American values and supporting the ruling class. Bannon calls for a reassessment of leadership in the Republican Party, emphasizing the need for genuine courage and commitment to the nation’s ideals.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed Anthony Fauci and the media’s treatment of him. Bannon highlighted Fauci’s role as a lightning rod for the Trump movement, criticizing how the media uses Fauci’s narrative to attack Trump. They argued that Fauci’s book and interviews are strategically timed to influence the 2024 election, portraying him heroically while vilifying Trump. Winters criticized the media for focusing on sensational aspects rather than substantive issues, suggesting that Fauci’s narrative is more about political maneuvering than public health. They also discussed Fauci’s connections and the broader skepticism around pandemic policies, implying a coordinated effort to discredit dissenting views as anti-science.  Natalie Winters critiques Anthony Fauci’s approach to media appearances and his book tour. She questions why Fauci opts for interviews with friendly hosts like Rachel Maddow and Stephen Colbert instead of engaging with more critical platforms like Bannon’s “War Room.” Winters suggests Fauci’s choices highlight a preference for controlled narratives over genuine dialogue. She also criticizes Fauci for shifting stances on critical issues such as the origins of COVID-19 and the efficacy of public health measures, accusing him of evasiveness and manipulation of facts. Winters implies that Fauci’s actions serve political agendas rather than the pursuit of scientific truth.

Mike Howell expressed strong criticism over the lack of effective action by Jim Jordan and others in Congress regarding defunding the DOJ, special counsel, and FBI. He described the efforts over the past year and a half as ineffective “Pen Pal games” with no real consequences for non-compliance by the current administration. Howell argued that merely talking about defunding at this late stage is absurd, given that significant concessions have already been made to President Biden. He suggested that Congress should appoint a legislative special counsel with substantial funding to take decisive action. Howell emphasized that the current measures, such as returning funds instead of utilizing them for investigations, are inadequate. He cited notable conservative legal figures advocating for more aggressive investigations into Democratic actions and criticized the lack of substantial responses to perceived abuses by the administration, including issues related to immigration and alleged political weaponization of institutions.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the significance and implications of a recent hearing featuring Dr. Anthony Fauci. They criticized the effectiveness of the hearing, suggesting it failed to adequately address key issues regarding the origins of COVID-19 and the involvement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Winters pointed out that many admissions made by Fauci, such as the arbitrary creation of the six-foot social distancing rule and the questionable efficacy and safety of vaccines, have long been suspected. Winters emphasized that despite bipartisan efforts, the hearing did not sufficiently expose deeper issues within the NIH or hold Fauci accountable. She argued that the pandemic was not due to incompetence but intentional actions, particularly by the Chinese Communist Party, and suggested that the NIH and Fauci were complicit. Bannon and Winters noted that the Democrats used the hearing to push for more pandemic prevention funding and mRNA vaccine development. At the same time, Republicans seemed more focused on creating viral moments rather than achieving substantive results. They also criticized establishment Republicans for not taking strong actions against China and for potentially using the hearing to protect Fauci and the status quo. Winters argued that the committee might be part of a cover-up operation, serving the establishment’s interests by using Peter Daszak as a scapegoat. Both Bannon and Winters expressed frustration with the hearing, seeing it as an insult to the intelligence of the American people and a missed opportunity to hold key figures accountable.  Steve Bannon and Dr. Bradley Thayer discussed the significance of the Tiananmen Square massacre and its broader implications. Thayer provided a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the massacre, emphasizing the brutal suppression of a pro-democracy movement by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He highlighted the CCP’s long history of suppressing dissent and the use of advanced technology to maintain control over the Chinese population. Thayer outlined several key lessons from the massacre, including the CCP’s willingness to use extreme measures to stay in power, the importance of democracy as an alternative to authoritarian rule, and the role of advanced technology in facilitating government control. He stressed the need for solidarity with the Chinese people in their struggle against CCP oppression. Bannon and Thayer expressed their commitment to commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and to raising awareness about the ongoing crisis in Taiwan. They also discussed upcoming discussions on related topics, such as the European parliamentary election and cybersecurity issues. Overall, the conversation underscored the continued relevance of Tiananmen Square as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and the importance of supporting democratic movements in China.  There’s confusion surrounding Biden’s approach to the Israel-Gaza conflict. While he’s been steadfast in other conflicts like Ukraine, calling for “as long as it takes,” he’s now pushing for an immediate end to the Israel-Gaza conflict, prompting questions about his motives. Hazony points out Biden’s three-stage plan, which lacks an aim to dismantle Hamas, the group behind the conflict. There’s concern that Biden’s rush for a ceasefire may stem from political expediency rather than strategic considerations. Additionally, there’s speculation about the stability of Netanyahu’s government amidst the crisis and potential implications for Israeli politics. Ultimately, Hazony warns of a misguided approach that may undermine long-term peace and stability in the region.  Raheem Kassam and Steve Bannon discussed the recent anti-Sharia protest in the UK, which Nigel Farage may view as a call for a more politically organized movement rather than just protests. They also highlighted the media’s suppression of incidents like the recent stabbing of a German police officer by a migrant, underscoring a pattern of normalization of such crimes by the political and media establishment. They emphasized the importance of outlets like the National Pulse for independent reporting and urged people to visit their website for truthful coverage.  Ben Harnwell and Steve Bannon discussed the UK’s Conservative Party’s complacency, highlighting its lack of genuine conservative values and the need for an alternative. They emphasized the urgency of dismantling the Tory party, which they perceived as co-opted by globalists. Transitioning to a discussion about America’s role in the global order, they explored why the prospect of a transactional approach under President Trump unnerves European elites. Bannon argued that America, once a beacon of liberty, has been compromised by its political class and now serves as a linchpin for the globalist order. They also touched upon the upcoming European parliamentary elections’ significance and coverage plans.

Steve Bannon discussed the ongoing resistance by Senate Democrats to President Trump’s nominees, comparing their obstruction tactics to those used by Mitch McConnell against President Obama in 2009. He highlighted how key figures like Russ Vought, Mark Paoletta, and Jeff Clark were being targeted in a prolonged confirmation process. Bannon emphasized that Democrats were using procedural delays, keeping the Senate up all night, and attempting to block conservative appointments, particularly those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for HHS, Tulsi Gabbard for DNI, and Pam Bondi for Attorney General. He noted that Democrats were panicking as they lost control over key agencies and were launching aggressive countermeasures, including additional committee hearings and media attacks on figures like Kash Patel.
As the discussion transitioned, Dave Brat joined to emphasize the significance of the National Prayer Breakfast. He framed it as a crucial event in what he described as an ongoing spiritual war, underscoring the role of faith in political and cultural battles. The segment shifted focus from political maneuvering to the broader ideological and moral struggles shaping the country’s leadership.
Steve Bannon’s comments emphasize the need for deep investigations into what he sees as coordinated efforts by intelligence agencies, Capitol Hill leaders, and the political establishment to undermine former President Trump. He argues that Trump was targeted similarly to past figures like Nixon, JFK, and RFK, suggesting a longstanding pattern of elite intervention. He calls for a special prosecutor and grand jury to expose these actions, particularly regarding election interference and Biden’s alleged foreign financial entanglements, which he believes were deliberately covered up.
Bannon also critiques the "Deep State” and its control over government spending, foreign policy, and economic policies. He argues that bipartisan elites have protected each other’s interests at the expense of the American people, funding programs that benefit globalist agendas while ignoring fiscal responsibility. He calls for drastic budget cuts, particularly in defense and foreign aid, and warns of financial collapse due to unsustainable debt.
He further highlights mass illegal immigration as an urgent crisis, advocating for mass deportations. He acknowledges the challenges ahead, describing it as a battle between the Deep State and the Trump movement. Bannon ties this struggle to broader geopolitical shifts, urging action against economic and political forces he believes are eroding American sovereignty.

Mike Davis and Steve Bannon discussed the legal and political challenges facing President Trump, emphasizing the need for a strong, aggressive legal strategy. Davis highlighted how Trump is using his constitutional authority to push reforms, including cutting wasteful spending, ending weaponization of intelligence agencies, and combating activist judicial overreach. However, opponents are seeking court injunctions to block these efforts. Davis urged the Trump Justice Department to aggressively seek emergency relief from appellate courts and the Supreme Court to override activist judges.
They also discussed broader judicial concerns, criticizing the DC District Court for its handling of January 6 defendants and its broader political bias. Davis called for legislation to curb judicial overreach and limit the power of activist judges.
On government restructuring, Davis supported Trump’s plans to downsize agencies like USAID, viewing it as a necessary step to rein in wasteful spending. He argued that under Article 2 of the Constitution, the president has the authority to manage the executive branch, including hiring and firing federal employees. The discussion also touched on the issue of impoundment, with Davis supporting Trump’s authority to prevent misallocated funds, particularly regarding foreign aid. The conversation underscored Trump’s commitment to reshaping government despite legal and political opposition.

Maureen shares her social media handles and jokes about bringing the tropical view back via a green screen for the event.
Natalie Winters reported from the White House about the strengths of the people nominated to be a part of President Trump’s administration.
Steve Bannon’s comments reflect his deep skepticism toward institutions like USAID, the Pentagon, and the Treasury, which he argues are controlled by the deep state and globalist interests. He claims USAID is a CIA front supporting illegal immigration, foreign influence, and suppression of conservative voices. Bannon calls for its complete shutdown, asserting that many involved are criminals.
He criticizes the Treasury for failing to prevent fraudulent payments and questions its leadership’s credibility. He insists President Trump must address these issues, particularly regarding economic policies and budget priorities. Bannon highlights the importance of Russ Vought and Scott Bessent as key figures in shaping a strong-dollar policy and fiscal responsibility.
On defense spending, Bannon demands substantial cuts, arguing that the Pentagon is rife with incompetence, corruption, and waste. He insists that real budget reductions must begin with the defense sector, rather than superficial discretionary spending cuts. He also takes aim at defense contractors and their potential conflicts of interest, particularly SpaceX, raising questions about its government funding.
Overall, Bannon frames the battle over government spending as a defining moment for Trump’s presidency, calling for a populist-driven, adult conversation on financial responsibility and systemic reform.

Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the challenges of immigration enforcement, sanctuary cities, and the role of federal authorities in addressing illegal immigration. Bannon emphasized the need for tougher measures against officials who obstruct immigration enforcement, suggesting that arresting non-compliant officials could send a strong message. Bergquam highlighted the inefficiency and cost of current enforcement strategies, advocating for better intelligence, expanded detention facilities, and a shift from administrative to criminal warrants. They criticized states like Illinois and California for resisting federal enforcement and using taxpayer money to oppose Trump’s policies.
The conversation also touched on cartel activity in Mexico, with Todd Bensman revealing that U.S. intelligence and Mexican military forces were preparing for kinetic operations against drug cartels, including targeting fentanyl labs and trafficking networks. He noted that previous border security efforts had significantly reduced human smuggling, forcing cartels to rely more on drug trafficking. Bergquam and Bensman warned that cartels, heavily armed with profits from past operations, would not surrender their business without a fight, predicting imminent confrontations. The discussion framed the situation as a battle over national security, urging stronger federal action and strategic military cooperation to dismantle cartel operations.

In a conversation between Dave Brat and Darren Beattie, they discussed the current tactics of the left in silencing opposition. Beattie argued that traditional methods like labeling opponents as racists or conspiracy theorists are less effective due to declining trust in the media. Consequently, the left has resorted to imprisoning political opponents, mentioning figures like Peter Navarro and Doug Mackey. Beattie suggested that such actions reflect the regime’s desperation and have backfired, strengthening public support for patriotism. Brat highlighted recent shifts in media messaging, particularly noting the New York Times’ inconsistent stance and the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party. Beattie elaborated on the complexities of replacing Biden, emphasizing that despite media hostility, influential Democrats are unlikely to oust him due to intertwined career interests and the risks involved. They concluded that Biden is likely to remain in place, but the Democrats face significant challenges. The discussion underscored the dynamic between media narratives and political strategy, with Brat and Beattie predicting continued turmoil within the Democratic ranks and the importance of alternative media like the War Room in providing accurate information.  In a conversation between Dave Brat and Jeff Clark on the War Room, Jeff Clark reacted to a clip featuring Bill Barr laughing about Steve Bannon being sent to prison. Clark expressed disappointment at Barr’s reaction, emphasizing the gravity of a former attorney general showing delight at someone’s imprisonment, especially a former top advisor to the president. He discussed the Supreme Court’s recent decision on presidential immunity, noting the mainstream media’s meltdown over the ruling and explaining that the decision reinforces the president’s authority to investigate and prosecute under the Constitution. Clark highlighted the ruling’s implications for the Deep State, arguing that it disrupts the established system where career officials, predominantly Democrats, controlled these decisions. He noted that the president now has reaffirmed control over such matters, causing significant concern among those officials. Dave Brat asked Clark about the media’s potential reactions and the significance of the ruling. Clark dismissed the media’s comparisons to extreme hypotheticals, emphasizing that the ruling aligns with the original constitutional framework and does not introduce new laws. He asserted that this ruling marks a return to the principles of the Constitution, challenging the post-constitutional era that began during the Progressive Era and intensified after Nixon. Clark further elaborated on the Supreme Court’s clarification of presidential immunity, explaining that official acts, such as the president’s speech on January 6th, should be protected. He argued that President Trump’s speech that day, urging people to peacefully and patriotically express their views, was an official act deserving of immunity. In conclusion, Clark encouraged listeners to support actions upholding the Constitution, such as calling on Congress to void the January 6th Committee’s subpoenas, including those leading to Bannon’s imprisonment.  In a conversation on the War Room, Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Polling discussed recent polling data with Dave Brat. The focus was on the aftermath of a debate and its impact on Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s standings. Mitchell noted a significant public concern about the country’s stability, with 41% of people fearing a potential civil war. Mitchell highlighted key recent events, such as a guilty verdict and a poor debate performance by Biden, which affected his approval ratings. Two months ago, Biden’s approval was 40%, with Trump leading him by 10 points. After the debate and other events, Biden’s approval briefly rose to 45%, reducing Trump’s lead to 5 points. However, Trump has since regained his lead, now at plus nine in head-to-head matchups. In their latest polling, Trump led Biden by 9 points, with 49% support for Trump and 40% for Biden. In a multi-way matchup, Trump’s lead increased to 10 points. Mitchell reported that 70% of voters watched most or all of the debate, with 56% declaring Trump the winner compared to 21% for Biden. Among Democrats, only 46% believed Biden won, and 24% thought Trump did. Post-debate, Biden’s approval among independents dropped to 34%, with overall approval falling to 28%, the lowest in two months. Mitchell concluded that the Democrats have returned to the difficult situation they faced in May, and Biden’s approval might dip further. He suggested that the Trump campaign should focus on winning down-ballot races, as inflation and the economy remain top concerns for voters.  Maureen Bannon, in her comments, emphasizes the importance of spreading the message of the “War Room” show and its content. She urges viewers to encourage their friends to watch the show and to open their eyes to the information being shared. She also mentions that despite her father, Steve Bannon, being in prison, his voice will still be heard through the show and its platforms. The message is clear: the “War Room” and its mission will not be silenced, and the show will continue to be a platform for sharing information and ideas.  Founder of Moms for Liberty, Tiffany Justice, talked to Natalie Winters about the schedule of events they have over the summer for people to get involved with their activism to support and defend parent rights and various campaigns.  In a discussion on War Room, Ben Harnwell highlighted Steve Bannon’s deep understanding of the system from his time in the Navy, the Pentagon, and Goldman Sachs, noting that Bannon’s insights have equipped the MAGA movement to fight against the very institutions where he first found success. Harnwell described Bannon as a “class traitor” not to the Republic or America but to establishments like Goldman Sachs and the military-industrial complex. He also discussed the significant political shift in France, where the National Rally saw increased support following the European elections, despite President Macron’s strategy to label them as far-right and present an ultimatum to voters. Harnwell emphasized the National Rally’s strict stance on immigration, distinguishing them from traditional elites and preventing them from being labeled far-left, despite their socialist and protectionist policies. He underscored that the elites are determined to bring in as many people from the third world into the West as possible, viewing this as an existential issue that only the people can stop.

This is Natalie’s 4 year Anniversary on the WarRoom program! In the War Room interview, Naomi Wolf and Dave Brat discuss Steve Bannon’s incarceration and the consequences of lawfare. Wolf argues that Bannon’s imprisonment at Federal Correctional Institute Danbury aims to silence him, comparing it to historical examples of suppressing opposition. She warns that silencing Bannon sets a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to the suppression of other dissenters. Wolf emphasizes the need for collective action to oppose political imprisonment and protect liberty. Brat agrees, praising Wolf’s insights and noting the historical significance of defending individual freedoms. He questions why conservatives seem less effective at mobilizing than liberals, attributing it to conservatives’ individualism and an optimistic, sometimes naive, belief in America’s resilience. Wolf suggests a deeper awareness of historical dangers is necessary to defend liberty effectively. The conversation also touches on pharmaceutical industry issues, with Brat criticizing monopolistic practices and advocating for a truly free market. Wolf concludes by calling for continued support for Bannon and vigilance against threats to freedom. The interview highlights concerns about political persecution and the need for unified resistance.  In a conversation on the WarRoom, Mark Paoletta and Dave Brat discuss the unprecedented nature of President Biden’s recent attacks on the Supreme Court. Paoletta highlights that Biden’s public criticism of the Court and specific justices, such as Thomas and Alito, is unprecedented and dangerous, with historical comparisons only to isolated instances by former Presidents Obama and Nixon. Paoletta argues that Biden’s motivation is to gain approval from the “lunatic left” and outdo Obama, which he claims undermines the integrity of the Court. Paoletta also mentions the increased attacks on Justice Clarence Thomas by Biden and other Democrats, particularly regarding allegations of ethical violations. He notes that these attacks are part of a broader trend of undermining the Supreme Court’s authority and calls for lawyers who work with the Court to defend its integrity. Dave Brat ties these issues to a larger context of what he sees as Marxist deconstruction by the left, impacting not just the judiciary but multiple institutions. He criticizes the double standards in the application of justice, pointing out the lack of accountability for Democratic figures while Republicans face severe scrutiny and legal action. Brat and Paoletta also discuss Representative Anna Paulina Luna’s efforts to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for not complying with a subpoena related to recordings that might incriminate him in mishandling classified documents. They stress the need for accountability and urge their audience to pressure Republican representatives to support the contempt resolution. The conversation underscores a belief that current political attacks and legal actions are part of a broader, ideologically driven effort to undermine conservative figures and principles, necessitating a strong and organized response from conservative supporters.  Caroline Wren and Maureen Bannon discuss the recent arrest of an individual in Maricopa County who pleaded not guilty despite clear evidence of guilt. They highlight the suspicious timing of his trial, set for November 6th, the day after the general election. They speculate that his detention without bail until then is politically motivated to prevent him from speaking to the press. They question why someone with a history of theft was allowed near sensitive election materials and suggest he was paid to steal the key fobs for the Maricopa County tabulators. They argue this incident supports claims of election interference, especially given past issues with malfunctioning tabulators in Maricopa County. They call for continued investigation into the individual’s background and motives, asserting that this case exemplifies broader issues of electoral integrity.

In a conversation between Darren Beattie and Natalie Winters, the discussion centers on the political dynamics surrounding President Biden and Project 2025. Beattie and Winters suggest that the Democrats’ focus is primarily on criticizing Project 2025 and other social issues. Beattie expresses a preference for Project 2025 over the current administration’s policies, highlighting concerns about Biden’s leadership and the media’s role in shaping public perception. They delve into the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party, noting the speculation about Biden stepping down and the potential elevation of Kamala Harris. Beattie, a former Trump administration official, criticizes the media’s treatment of Biden, arguing that their recent criticisms are attempts to salvage their own credibility rather than improve the Democratic ticket’s prospects. Beattie emphasizes that the media’s lies and timing have placed the Democrats in a difficult position. He believes that replacing Biden now would invite chaos and further damage their chances in the 2024 election. The conversation highlights the media’s role in political narratives and the strategic challenges facing both parties.  Natalie Winters set out a call to action for people to call the US House about the failure to hold Merrick Garland accountable.  Mike Benz suggests that the Democrats will continue to use Russiagate to frame any pro-Trump, anti-Biden, or NATO-skeptical voices as potential threats backed by Russia. This strategy allows federal investigators to target and censor domestic influencers and political opponents, leveraging FISA and other tools. Benz notes the shift in focus from foreign to domestic disinformation and highlights the need for a perceived foreign threat to justify renewed social media censorship. He warns that the CIA’s actions will support this narrative, making it difficult for dissenting voices to operate freely online.  Mike McCormick, a former Biden staffer, discusses Joe Biden’s health decline and the internal conflict within the Democratic Party. He believes Biden, despite his decline, is determined to stay in office unless forced out by a higher power. McCormick identifies key figures in Biden’s inner circle, such as Steve Ricchetti and Tom Donilon, who support him. He highlights tensions between the Biden, Obama, and Clinton factions, suggesting that Biden might replace Kamala Harris with Hillary Clinton to secure party unity and fundraising support. McCormick also claims that Democrats are preparing a strategy involving ballot manipulation to ensure Biden’s re-election.  EJ Antoni criticizes the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for underreporting inflation, arguing that official statistics fail to reflect the real cost of living increases felt by Americans. He highlights discrepancies in health insurance and housing costs, noting that while BLS claims health insurance costs have dropped, real expenses have risen. Antoni also points out that mortgage payments on median-priced homes have surged 117% since Biden took office, contradicting BLS figures. This perceived underreporting makes Americans feel gaslighted as they struggle with higher costs for essentials like food, rent, and utilities. Antoni argues that the Biden administration’s economic messaging is out of touch, as many Americans face financial hardships. He asserts that this disconnect is influencing voting preferences, with the economy becoming a top priority for voters regardless of their political affiliation.  Jeff Clark and Ben Harnwell discussed the impeachment resolutions against Justices Thomas and Alito led by AOC. Clark explained these resolutions aim to intimidate justices and are unlikely to pass, lacking support and legislative viability. He criticized the resolutions as politically motivated attacks to make the justices’ lives difficult. Clark highlighted the resolutions’ sponsorship by prominent leftist House members and dismissed the allegations as baseless. He also shared his contact information and expressed readiness to provide future updates on the situation.  US Rep. Bob Good gave an update about the recount effort for his campaign.  Col. Harvey criticizes Democratic efforts to influence the Supreme Court by attempting to remove justices like Thomas and Alito. The GOP speaker argues that Democrats expect compliance with their agenda regardless of being in or out of power, using AOC’s impeachment resolution as an example. The speaker dismisses the likelihood of these resolutions passing, viewing them as political stunts aimed at intimidating the justices. They also discuss the improbability of such resolutions against judges on similar grounds, emphasizing the perceived abuses of power and political motives behind these actions. The speaker advocates for fair voting and criticizes NATO’s handling of the Ukraine conflict, attributing NATO’s recent vitality to Trump’s policies.

In a conversation on the War Room, Jeff Clark discussed the dismissal of a significant classified documents case, involving for President Donald Trump. Clark praised Judge Cannon’s ruling, calling it a monumental decision that highlighted the unconstitutionality of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office under the appointments clause. Clark argued that Smith’s appointment violated the law because, unlike regular U.S. attorneys, he did not undergo Senate confirmation. Clark emphasized the thoroughness of Judge Cannon’s 93-page opinion, which addressed the unconstitutional appointment and Smith’s misuse of public funds. He also noted that the depth of her ruling proved critics of Cannon wrong. Natalie Winters inquired about the broader implications of this ruling on Trump’s legal battles and his opponents’ strategies. Clark and Mike pointed out that Trump’s opponents are unlikely to give up and will continue their efforts against him. They emphasized the need for Trump’s supporters to defend him against these tactics. Clark also criticized that the Justice Department operates independently of the President, arguing that it should be under presidential oversight. He attributed the flawed special counsel regulations from the Clinton administration to Neil Katyal and reiterated the need for constitutional adherence in creating government offices. Clark concluded by providing information on how to follow his work and stay updated with his writings and the Center for Renewing America.  Natalie Winters and Brian Glen discussed the kickoff of the RNC convention in Milwaukee, emphasizing the need for heightened security due to threats from leftist groups. They stressed the importance of supporting Trump’s 2024 campaign to defeat various enemies, including communists and globalists. Glen recounted his experience at a recent Trump rally where an assassination attempt on Trump occurred. Despite the heavy security presence, the event highlighted significant security lapses, with local police being blamed. The discussion also covered the transformation of the RNC into a MAGA-focused entity, celebrating the influence of Trump’s movement. They criticized the Biden administration for security failures and incompetence. The segment concluded with a tribute to veterans and a call to support the Disabled American Veterans organization.  In Milwaukee for the RNC Convention, Ben Bergquam interviews Republican Congressman Burgess Owens, discussing their enthusiasm for the event and President Trump’s 2024 campaign. Owens highlights the significance of the convention, emphasizing Trump’s defiance, courage, and love for America. They address the recent assassination attempt on Trump, critiquing media figures like Joy Reid for inciting violence with their rhetoric. Owens asserts that Americans, tired of negativity and division, are yearning for unity and hope, which Trump embodies. He believes the media’s bias has led to their loss of credibility and that Americans are now holding them accountable for their dishonesty. Owens expresses optimism for the future, predicting victories in the House and Senate and a Trump presidency, which he believes will bring positive policy changes and a renewed sense of hope. Bergquam notes the shift in support from black and Hispanic communities towards Trump, which Owens attributes to a desire for freedom and a positive future. Owens concludes by praising the influx of America First legislators in Congress, reflecting a broader movement towards traditional American values and unity.  Mike Davis joins Natalie Winters to discuss the recent legal victory for President Trump. Judge Eileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Trump, ruling that the special counsel’s office is unconstitutional. Davis explains that the U.S. Constitution requires new officers or taxpayer money spending to be approved by Congress, which wasn’t done in this case. He emphasizes that Congress allowed the independent counsel statute to lapse after the Ken Starr investigation of Clinton, but the Justice Department attempted to bypass this by creating the special counsel’s office through regulation. This office operates with little oversight and an unlimited budget, which Cannon deemed unconstitutional. Davis believes the Biden Justice Department may attempt to bring the case again through a U.S. attorney who is appropriately appointed and confirmed. Jeff Clark joins via Skype, calling the ruling monumental and praising Cannon for her detailed 93-page opinion. He criticizes the media for previously dismissing concerns about the special counsel’s constitutionality and highlights Justice Thomas’s concurrence in a related case as influential in Cannon’s decision. Clark argues that the Justice Department’s actions represent an unconstitutional overreach, reminiscent of historical grievances against the British monarchy. Davis and Clark agree that Trump’s opponents won’t relent despite this setback, predicting continued legal and political challenges. They stress the importance of defending Trump against what they see as politically motivated lawfare. Davis also discusses his role in helping draft a streamlined America First RNC platform, emphasizing its appeal to a broad coalition of voters.  Natalie Winters and Matt Taylor discuss the upcoming film “Government Gangsters,” set to debut this week at the RNC, which highlights the influence of career bureaucrats, termed as the “Deep State,” within U.S. government agencies. The film, based on Kash Patel’s book, aims to expose the deep state’s use of a two-tier justice system against figures like Donald Trump, and events such as Russiagate and the Hunter Biden laptop saga. Taylor, who played a key role in the film’s creation, expresses excitement for its screening at the RNC in Milwaukee on July 19th and emphasizes the film’s comprehensive coverage of deep state attacks over the past eight years. He highlights the film’s goal of educating viewers on the corruption within high-level government officials. Taylor acknowledges the expected resistance from media and Washington insiders due to the film’s controversial content. He recounts his experience with similar projects, including collaborations with Steve Bannon and films on Clinton and Hunter Biden, which also faced significant pushback. Despite these challenges, Taylor and his team are prepared for the backlash, believing the public deserves to know the truth about unelected bureaucrats influencing their lives. The film’s release is being promoted on warroomfilm.com, with pre-orders available. Taylor concludes by encouraging viewers to attend the screening or pre-order the film to understand the mechanics of the deep state and its impact on American politics.  Jm Hoft from Gateway Pundit discusses his newest media project, a new website launching today.  Natalie Winters introduces Congressman Andy Ogles, a member of the House Oversight Committee, recalling their past interaction at a conservative club in Tennessee. Ogles shares his experience as a county executive during COVID-19, where he kept his community open, defying mandates based on his interpretation of state law and his constitutional duty. He traveled to Tennessee with Tennessee Stands to educate other executives and mayors on their rights, keeping most communities open. Ogles briefly touches on an upcoming House Oversight Committee hearing with the Secret Service director, highlighting unanswered questions regarding a recent security lapse. He hints at a blame game between the Secret Service and local law enforcement, stressing the need for accountability. Winters agrees, noting the public’s desire for answers and accountability from the committee’s work. They plan to delve deeper into these issues after the break.

In a conversation between Josh Hammer and Natalie Winters the focus is on the significance of political figures and their impact on the Republican Party, particularly in the context of the upcoming 2024 election. Josh Hammer emphasizes the importance of appealing to the white working-class and middle-class voters, who were instrumental in Donald Trump’s 2016 victory. He argues that these voters, primarily from the American Heartland, are crucial for the Republican Party’s success. Hammer also highlights the need to solidify support in key states like Arizona, North Carolina, Florida, and Texas while making inroads in the Rust Belt, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Hammer praises Donald Trump for his ability to appeal to a broad demographic, including white voters and other race voters, and underscores his strong stance on issues like immigration and opposition to continuous aid packages to Ukraine. He points out that Trump’s appeal extends to younger generations frustrated with the policies of older political leaders. Hammer also mentions the potential of JD Vance as a candidate who resonates with Millennials and Gen Z, highlighting his eloquence and intelligence.

He highlighted the presence of a lone Trump supporter amidst the protests and noted that none of the protesters he spoke with would denounce the assassination attempt on Trump.

He criticized the Democrat Party’s influence and the mainstream media’s portrayal of Trump, expressing a strong personal connection to Trump and his policies.

Patty Lyman praised Vance’s authenticity and relatability, noting his overcoming adversity and his connection to everyday struggles. She also lauded President Trump’s resilience and determination, reinforcing the belief that the Trump-Vance ticket represents the core of the new Republican Party dedicated to the “forgotten man.”  Patti Lyman praises JD Vance, emphasizing his resilience and relatability. She recommends watching the movie “Hillbilly Elegy” on Netflix, highlighting Vance’s struggles and triumphs, which resonate with many Americans. Lyman believes voters want leaders who understand their lived experiences, and Vance exemplifies this through his humble beginnings and personal challenges. She also notes Vance’s diverse background, including his marriage to a brilliant Indian wife and his recent conversion to Catholicism. Natalie Winters comments on the emotional moment when JD Vance received his nomination, noting his visible choked-up reaction. She criticizes political figures like Karl Rove and John Bolton for their negative reactions to Vance’s nomination.

Darren J. Beattie, in this segment, praises JD Vance, explaining why he believes Vance was a good choice for President Trump despite Vance’s past “Never Trump” remarks. Beattie emphasizes that Vance’s book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” captured the underlying issues driving the America First movement, indicating Vance’s ideological alignment with Trump’s goals. Beattie also highlights Vance’s opposition from establishment figures in media and politics, like Lindsey Graham, who Beattie says worked against Vance’s political career. He contends that Vance’s stances, particularly against foreign wars and misuse of taxpayer money, align with the America First agenda, making him a suitable pick for Trump’s vice presidential candidate and a significant player in the movement’s future.  Darren Beattie criticizes the Secret Service for their failures during an attempted assassination of President Trump, suggesting these failures may be due to incompetence or intentional neglect. He points out how the shooter managed to get on a roof with a rifle, and despite multiple warnings from the crowd, Secret Service officers failed to act. Beattie finds it suspicious that the shooter had no discernible internet footprint and questions how he knew the roof would be unguarded. He also highlights a pattern of Secret Service failures, referencing the January 6th pipe bomb incident. Beattie calls for thorough investigations into these security breaches, emphasizing the need for accountability and better protection for Trump at future events.  In this conversation, Darren Beattie emphasizes that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the Secret Service, has redefined what it means to be a domestic extremist and terrorist, now largely targeting MAGA supporters. He suggests this redefinition might explain why threats to President Trump could slip through the cracks. Beattie also discusses the DHS’s weaponization against MAGA, mentioning figures like Bennie Thompson, who have pushed for actions against Trump. Beattie then discusses Elon Musk’s substantial financial support for pro-Trump PACs, highlighting Musk’s strategic move to ensure Trump’s victory for his business interests. He notes that significant figures in Silicon Valley are also backing Trump, creating a cascade effect of support within the tech industry. Beattie underscores the existential stakes for Musk and others if Trump does not win, asserting that this financial backing is crucial and encouraging for Trump’s campaign.  The filmmakers of “God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust,” David A.R. White and his team, joined Natalie Winters to discuss their upcoming film, which premieres on September 12th. This is the fifth installment of the most successful faith-based franchise in film history.

The conversation shifts to analyzing an assassination attempt on Trump, criticizing the Secret Service for significant security lapses. They question the lack of immediate action and transparency, expressing concerns about future safety measures at Trump events. Kassam and Winters also ponder the political implications of the incident, suggesting that it might be used to push anti-Trump narratives and increase security at future rallies. They emphasize the need for accountability and thorough investigations to prevent such failures from recurring.  In a discussion at the RNC, US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene spoke with Natalie Winters about the concept of unity being pushed in the wake of President Trump’s recent legal challenges. Greene criticized the idea of uniting with Democrats, highlighting what she sees as their divisive actions over the past years, such as opening borders, vilifying conservatives, and weaponizing the justice system against Trump supporters. She pointed out specific incidents like the treatment of January 6th protesters and pro-life activists and criticized attempts to remove Trump’s Secret Service protection. Greene contrasted the left’s reaction to threats against Biden with how Trump supporters reacted to recent events, emphasizing the peaceful response of prayer rather than violence. She mentioned the upcoming hearing with the Secret Service Director, overseen by the Homeland Security Committee, to address accountability and transparency in ongoing investigations. Greene expressed skepticism about the government’s reliability, citing past misinformation and emphasizing the need for patience as Republicans work to bring accountability.  The three agreed that JD Vance should be picked as the Vice President and shared their insights about Vance’s background, his book, and President Trump and Steve Bannon’s populist movement.

They both express the emotional impact of Trump’s appearance at the convention. The conversation shifts to an assassination attempt on Trump, criticizing the Secret Service’s leadership for security failures. Cruz calls for the resignation of the Secret Service director and the Secretary of Homeland Security, citing the preventable nature of the attempt. Bossie mentions ongoing security concerns for the convention in Milwaukee. Cruz plans to address the southern border crisis in his upcoming speech at the RNC, highlighting violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants released by the Biden administration, and emphasizing the need for accountability and security.

He emphasized Vance’s ability to connect with working-class and military communities, echoing Trump’s appeal. Jordan discussed the energetic atmosphere following Trump’s appearance at the convention, praising Trump’s resilience and leadership under pressure.

Dan Fleuette talked to Jayne Zirkle about the movie version of Kash Patel’s book Clinton Cash, set to premiere on Thursday at the RNC Convention.  The film will then be released to the public. Fleuette co-produced the film with WarRoom host Steve Bannon, a political prisoner, on the day his movie will premiere.  In their War Room conversation from the Republican Convention, Natalie Winters, who continued her rejection of calls for unity between Republicans, and Mike Davis, who discussed the legal and political challenges facing President Trump, Davis focused on Special Counsel Jack Smith. Davis noted that Judge Eileen Cannon ruled Smith’s appointment violated constitutional clauses because the special counsel office was not statutorily created and lacked proper oversight. He expects the Biden Justice Department’s appeal won’t be resolved before the election. He recommends that Trump’s acting attorney general dismiss the cases and investigate Smith if Trump is re-elected. Davis also criticized Gavin Newsom’s California legislation, which limits parental rights regarding children’s gender identity, as a severe state overreach. Winters highlighted Trump’s lead in recent polls, suggesting that the American public sees through Biden’s administration. Davis emphasized the need for early voting to avoid disruptions on Election Day. The conversation praised Trump’s judicial appointments, noting that the Supreme Court is now better positioned to check executive overreach. Both Winters and Davis rejected any notion of unity with Democrats, who they believe are undermining conservative values. They stressed the importance of Trump’s continued influence in the Republican Party and the need for a robust America First agenda to address these challenges effectively.  In a War Room discussion, Natalie Winters, who continued her theme of rejecting unity, and Terry Schilling criticized Governor Gavin Newsom’s legislation, which limits parental rights regarding children’s gender identity, arguing it places state authority above parental rights. Schilling emphasized this shift as unprecedented and part of a broader cultural warfare. He praised Trump’s judicial appointments for restoring constitutional principles essential to countering governmental overreach. Schilling urged Republicans to vote early in the 2024 election, warning of potential disruptions similar to the BLM riots in 2020. He attributed recent violence to Biden’s inflammatory rhetoric against Trump, asserting it fosters justification for extreme actions. Schilling stressed the need for a united Republican party to ensure Trump’s agenda if re-elected, cautioning against entrenched bureaucrats who could undermine his policies. He emphasized the importance of judicial decisions and accountability in restoring constitutional governance and countering the weaponization of law for cultural agendas.  In their discussion, Natalie Winters and Congressman Tim Burchette focused on the aftermath of the assassination attempt and its implications for oversight. Burchette criticized the Biden administration and DHS Secretary Mayorkas for alleged cover-ups and incompetence regarding the security breach. He emphasized the failure to secure the perimeter and raised concerns about the Secret Service’s preparedness and response. Burchette also criticized media coverage and perceived biases, suggesting a reluctance to investigate critically. He highlighted ongoing investigations by the House Oversight Committee into the incident and expressed skepticism about cooperation from the administration. The conversation underscored broader concerns within the GOP about security, media scrutiny, and partisan divides affecting legislative oversight.  In a conversation featuring Rep. Miller, Natalie Winters, and Tim Burchette, the focus was on the call for Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign amidst perceived failures. Miller emphasized the need for accountability, criticizing the Biden administration for various issues like Afghanistan and border security. There was frustration over the lack of consequences for these failures and a call for hearings to address them. The discussion shifted to the role of congressional committees in accountability and the perception that efforts had shifted from criminal referrals to preparing for Trump’s potential return. Miller stressed the importance of holding accountable those who compromise conservative values, expressing confidence in Trump’s ability to enforce accountability if re-elected. They also discussed messaging strategies at the RNC and challenges posed by Democratic policies like inflation and border security. The conversation touched on legislative efforts, including Miller’s bill on transgender athletes in sports, framed as protecting women’s opportunities under Title IX. Overall, the conversation highlighted frustrations with current policies, calls for accountability, and a strong emphasis on preparing for future political battles under Trump’s leadership.   In this segment of the War Room, Julian Murray from Delaware, Tamara Makai from Hawaii, and Delois Stallman from Virginia all expressed their enthusiastic support for President Trump and their roles within the Republican Party in their respective states. Julian highlighted efforts to deliver Delaware for Trump, emphasizing the absence of vote-by-mail and Trump’s popularity in the state. Tamara discussed challenges in Hawaii, aiming to turn the state red amidst opposition from wealthy figures like Zuckerberg and Bezos. Delois focused on Virginia’s potential to shift Republican, citing recent rallies and efforts to maximize voter turnout. Their unified message underscored grassroots efforts and state-level strategies to support Trump’s agenda and Republican victories.

During a WarRoom discussion, Natalie Winters, Monica Crowley, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene addressed several key issues.  The conversation turned somber with a tribute to the late Lou Dobbs, whom Crowley remembered fondly for his pioneering work on immigration issues and his impact on media. Crowley highlighted Dobbs’ foresight on border security and illegal immigration, noting his clashes with CNN executives over these topics. She reflected on his significant role in shaping national discourse and expressed deep sympathy for his family. Rep. Greene then discussed President Trump’s upcoming speech, predicting it would address immigration and aim to unite Americans. She criticized the Biden administration’s handling of immigration and expressed concern over reports of resistance from Secretary Mayorkas and the FBI regarding ongoing investigations. Greene emphasized the need for transparency and accountability from federal agencies.  At the premiere of the film Government Gnageters at the RNC, Raheem Kassam, Kash Patel, and MA Taylor discussed the film “Government Gangsters,” which pays tribute to Stephen K. Bannon and honors the late Lou Dobbs. Kassam opened the Q&A by highlighting the film’s challenges, noting the dangers in making such a politically charged documentary. He acknowledged the bravery required to tackle topics that could put a target on the filmmakers’ heads, referencing recent events and the ongoing fight against corruption. Patel responded by acknowledging the numerous death threats they’ve received, expressing that these threats are a sad reality but won’t deter them. He emphasized the importance of standing firm and drawing strength from leaders like Bannon and Trump, stressing the need to take actions that positively impact America. MA Taylor echoed Patel’s sentiments and dedicated the film to Lou Dobbs, recognizing Dobbs’ significant contributions to the news and media. Taylor emphasized that Dobbs’ legacy in truth-telling is generational and will be remembered for a long time. Despite the overwhelming challenges posed by entities like the FBI, Taylor reinforced the film’s mission to expose and combat corruption.  This segment shows public participation after the movie, with questions from the audience.

In their conversation, Matthew Whitaker and Dave Brat discuss the current state of the Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Merrick Garland, contrasting it with Whitaker’s tenure during the Trump administration. Whitaker highlights that during his time at the DOJ, justice was applied evenly, following the Constitution and the rule of law without political bias. He criticizes Garland for allegedly targeting individuals supportive of Trump, like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, and for the perceived selective application of the law. Whitaker emphasizes that the Supreme Court has recently upheld the rule of law, citing a significant opinion on the separation of powers and presidential immunity. He underscores the importance of this ruling for sustaining the constitutional republic. Whitaker also discusses how, under Trump’s administration, the DOJ focused on border security and reducing violent crime, claiming these efforts were effective. Brat asks Whitaker for examples of the DOJ’s impartiality under Trump, to which Whitaker responds by mentioning the handling of the Mueller investigation and how it concluded without politicization. Whitaker believes that current DOJ actions are politically motivated, using novel legal theories against Trump and his allies. They also touch on the Supreme Court’s recent decisions, including the overturning of the Chevron deference and the affirmation of presidential immunity for official acts. Whitaker argues that the left’s reaction to the immunity ruling is exaggerated, as this principle has been long-standing in U.S. history. Whitaker concludes by noting that recent Supreme Court decisions will impact ongoing cases against Trump, potentially leading to re-evaluation of evidence and delays in proceedings. Brat commends Whitaker’s clear and rational explanations of these complex legal and constitutional issues.  Scott Presler and Natalie Winters discuss the significant political shifts in Pennsylvania, highlighting Presler’s grassroots efforts and voter registration successes. Presler shares impressive statistics, noting that the Democratic voter advantage has shrunk from 595,000 to 75,000 in two years. This progress is attributed to a focused outreach to various demographic groups, including Amish, truckers, hunters, and young men. Presler emphasizes the importance of targeting communities like the Amish, hunters, and truckers and details efforts to engage these groups through events and direct interactions. He also mentions the increasing support among young men, mainly black and Hispanic males, and Jewish community members following recent political developments. Winters and Presler also discuss the impact of the recent presidential debate on public opinion. Many voters perceive President Biden as unfit and President Trump as presidential. Presler believes this perception shift is reflected in voter registration trends and polling data. Presler encourages active political involvement, urging people to download the Early Vote Action app to participate in voter registration efforts and volunteer as election day workers. He stresses the importance of having election day workers to ensure election integrity, especially in states with extended early voting periods.  Natalie Winters and Savannah Hernandez discuss a shocking incident in San Francisco during a Pride event. Hernandez describes witnessing fully naked men, public sex acts, and urination in front of children, with police officers not intervening. She highlights the double standards in law enforcement, contrasting the lack of action in San Francisco with the severe penalties faced by those who damage pride flags or political figures like Steve Bannon. Hernandez expresses concern over the exposure of such acts to children and criticizes the Biden administration for supporting these events. Winters and Hernandez both criticize the mainstream Democratic Party for pushing these values in classrooms and fear these behaviors will be normalized in educational materials. Hernandez also points out that public nudity, which was banned in 2012, is permitted during such events with city approval.  In their conversation, Dave Brat and Ben Harnwell discussed a significant conference held at the Vatican a decade ago, focusing on wealth creation from a Christian perspective. Ben organized the meeting to counter the Marxist undertones in Pope Francis’s pontificate. They highlighted Steve Bannon’s involvement in the conference and his prescient views on global populist movements, issues like Islam, Russia, and economic policies. They also touched on Bannon’s advocacy for Judeo-Christian values and critiques of socialism. Their dialogue underscored themes of moral foundations in Western civilization and critiques of historical mischaracterizations of fascism and socialism.  Steve Bannon’s intense interview with Vaughn Hillyard on MSNBC before he surrendered to the Danbury Correctional facility on Monday delved into various contentious issues. Bannon criticized MSNBC’s coverage of executive power, arguing against expanded surveillance measures and emphasizing recent legal setbacks for executive authority. He defended his actions during the January 6th committee investigation, asserting his adherence to legal strategies to contest election results. Bannon accused MSNBC of bias and collaboration with the Justice Department, highlighting perceived injustices and calling for investigations into alleged abuses of power. He outlined his priorities for the future, including immigration policy reform, fiscal conservatism, and ending military engagements abroad. Bannon’s determined defense of himself, President Trump, and the MAGA movement underscored his ongoing influence within the MAGA movement and his commitment to challenging establishment norms. The interview highlighted deep divisions over constitutional interpretations and the role of media in shaping public discourse on political issues.

In a recent War Room discussion, Dave Brat and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs discussed critical issues facing the nation, highlighting their frustrations with Washington’s bureaucracy and political accountability. The conversation opened with a tribute to Steve Bannon, emphasizing his resilience and the current political climate, which they described as a period where “weeks feel like decades.” The discussion centered around three major issues: the border invasion, two trillion dollar deficits, and endless wars, all of which Biggs asserts he consistently opposes. Brat commended Biggs for his unwavering commitment to truth, despite the challenges of operating within what he called “the swamp.” A significant portion of the conversation was dedicated to the Secret Service’s handling of a security breach involving a suspicious individual during a high-profile event attended by former President Trump. Biggs criticized the agency’s failure to maintain adequate security measures and suggested that the Secret Service did not act on critical information that could have prevented a potential threat. He emphasized the need for accountability and questioned whether the shooter acted alone, pointing to possible connections to someone associated with the FBI. Brat and Biggs also discussed the broader issue of accountability in Congress, lamenting the lack of consequences for bad behavior and fiscal irresponsibility. Biggs argued for defunding certain agencies and holding individuals accountable to curb abuses within the administrative state. He expressed disappointment with his colleagues’ reluctance to push for significant legislative changes. The conversation concluded with a plea for the release of Steve Bannon, whom Brat and Biggs consider a political prisoner. They criticized the judiciary’s treatment of Bannon and emphasized the importance of advocating for fair treatment. Biggs pledged to continue fighting for accountability and justice, stressing the need for strong leadership to address the nation’s pressing issues.  In this War Room conversation, Dave Brat and Catherine Engelbrecht discussed their ongoing efforts to ensure election integrity, emphasizing the critical nature of their work amidst political uncertainty. Engelbrecht praised as a War Room hero, explained the primary objectives of her organization, True the Vote, which focuses on enhancing the accuracy of voter rolls, addressing gaps in polling places, and encouraging volunteer involvement. She announced the launch of Vote Alert, an app designed to enable voters to report on-the-ground irregularities, and a Spanish version called Nesto, aimed at engaging the Latino community. Engelbrecht highlighted recent developments in Wisconsin, where the reintroduction of drop boxes has become a focal point of her group’s efforts. She emphasized working closely with local sheriffs to monitor these voting methods, aiming to prevent potential fraud. Brat and Engelbrecht expressed gratitude for the support from their community, recognizing the unsung heroes who contribute to these efforts. Engelbrecht urged the War Room Posse to take actionable steps by signing up at TrueTheVote.org for updates on projects and accessing the IV3.us app to monitor local voter rolls for ineligible records. She noted significant victories, challenging over 700,000 questionable records across 1,300 counties. Engelbrecht underscored the urgency of active participation by addressing the broader political landscape, viewing the current political climate as a spiritual battle requiring voter turnout and civic engagement. Engelbrecht and Brat acknowledged the uphill battle ahead, emphasizing the importance of unity and perseverance in defending fundamental liberties. Engelbrecht concluded by stressing the need for moral action, regardless of party affiliation, and called for renewed dedication to the cause of freedom and democracy.  This conversation on the War Room with Dave Brat and Alex DeGrasse discusses a broad analysis of the current political landscape, emphasizing key dynamics involving Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party’s strategy for the upcoming elections. The discussion begins with DeGrasse, Executive Director of Team Elise Stefanik, outlining the critical role of grassroots activism, encouraging supporters to engage as poll watchers and volunteers to secure the vote. He highlights a recent trend of increased enthusiasm among Democrats, particularly within the African-American community, following Harris’s growing prominence. The conversation focuses on Harris’s political position, noting her perceived weaknesses and potential impact as a candidate. Brat and DeGrasse discuss how Harris has assumed responsibility for many of President Joe Biden’s policies, painting her as an “enabler-in-chief” with policies positioned to the left of Biden. The conversation emphasizes Harris’s low approval ratings and job performance, branding her as a weaker candidate for the Democrats. However, DeGrasse notes the strategic challenge Republicans face, as Harris hasn’t been as thoroughly defined in the public eye compared to Biden. The hosts also discuss the possibility of significant moves by former President Obama, suggesting he might influence the Democratic establishment to support an alternative candidate. DeGrasse stresses the necessity for the Republican Party to capitalize on Harris’s weaknesses by emphasizing her policies, particularly her statements on immigration and other issues, in critical swing districts.  Natalie Winters opened the show with strong commentary on recent political events and controversies. She suggests there’s an underlying agenda to sideline Steve Bannon by keeping him in jail. Natalie assures listeners that War Room will prioritize the “signal over the noise,” providing clear insights into the complex issues at play. Winters expresses disappointment at accusations of sexism following criticisms of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies and affirmative action in hiring, specifically within the Secret Service and the events on Saturday, July 13, when President Trump was shot, along with three other Americans, one who died from his wounds. She references a statement by the DHS dismissing these concerns as sexist and argues against the notion that DEI policies are to blame for security failures. Winters argues that this is an intentional failure by the Biden administration rather than incompetence, questioning the regime’s actions across various fronts, including border security, the economy, and President Joe Biden’s mental health. She insists that blaming DEI policies gives the administration a way to dodge responsibility for these issues, particularly in the context of the alleged assassination attempt. Additionally, Winters criticizes Biden’s inadequate communication, referencing his unofficial endorsement of Kamala Harris and suggesting that his erratic behavior is a sign of his inability to lead the nation effectively. She calls for invoking the 25th Amendment, asserting that Biden is unfit for office. Winters concludes by warning that America’s adversaries—and even allies—are watching and laughing at the nation’s perceived weakness, suggesting that they see it as an opportunity to take advantage of a lack of strong leadership.  Part One: The discussion between Darren Beattie and Natalie Winters goes into the alleged incompetence and potential malfeasance within the Secret Service and its handling of recent security incidents. Beattie, a former Biden administration official, criticizes the Biden administration and Secret Service, specifically focusing on the agency’s response to security threats. He begins by commenting on the strange circumstances surrounding the alleged assassination attempt on July 13th and questions whether the failure to prevent it was due to “diversity” hires or a deliberate act by the “deep state.” Beattie argues that the incompetence displayed could either be criminal negligence or intentional complicity, suggesting that members of the Secret Service should face legal consequences for their actions. Beattie further analyzes the Secret Service’s response to the discovery of a pipe bomb near the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters on January 6, 2021. He highlights how the Secret Service’s response seemed suspiciously relaxed, allowing schoolchildren to pass near the bomb without immediate action. Beattie speculates that the agents might have known the bomb was fake, raising questions about how they could have known this in advance. This leads him to question the agency’s credibility and suggests a possible cover-up or intentional mishandling of the situation.  Part Two:  In a recent conversation on War Room, Natalie Winters and Mike Benz discussed the potential political downfall of President Joe Biden, particularly in light of a letter from former intelligence community members suggesting Biden step down. Benz had previously predicted that such a letter would signal Biden’s end due to his strong ties with the foreign policy establishment, or “the blob.” This establishment, which includes the State Department, Department of Defense, and CIA, has been Biden’s power base throughout his political career, as he was once dubbed “Mr. Foreign Policy” by the Council on Foreign Relations. Benz highlighted that 48 former members of the intelligence and national security community recently signed a letter suggesting Biden should resign, echoing the 51 signatories who previously labeled Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation. Among the signatories is Rosa Brooks, a former high-level Pentagon official and head of the Transition Integrity Project, which reportedly simulated strategies to ensure Biden’s presidency even if Trump won the election. Benz noted that on the same day as the letter’s release, a protest group called “Pass the Torch, Joe” emerged, calling for Biden to step down, drawing parallels to tactics used to challenge Trump. The conversation shifted to the influence of powerful entities like the Transition Integrity Project and figures like Nils Gilman and Reid Hoffman, who have been involved in controversial political maneuvers. They discussed how the concept of democracy is threatened by oligarchic networks willing to undermine elections to maintain power. The discussion also touched on theories surrounding an assassination attempt on Trump and the alleged role of certain individuals and groups. Benz noted parallels between the January 6 Capitol riot and other political events, highlighting concerns about democracy and governance manipulation. Part One:  Part Two:

In a Tuesday WarRoom conversation, Peter Navarro and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs discussed the implementation challenges of the First Step Act of 2018, which aims to reduce recidivism and the federal prison population through earned time credits for inmates. Navarro, who experienced the federal prison system firsthand, criticized the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for failing to implement the act effectively, resulting in delayed releases by six to twelve months. Biggs supported Navarro’s claims, noting that BOP Director Peters acknowledged the backlog affecting approximately 60,000 inmates. Biggs expressed frustration over federal overreach, stating, “There are far too many federal crimes. The founders had it right: criminal law is supposed to be left to the states. Instead, we have over 40,000 federal offenses, leading to absurd imprisonments.” He argued that reducing federal crimes could prevent such issues and highlighted that prisoners compliant with state laws still faced incarceration due to federal violations. Navarro shared a poignant story about an inmate who missed his mother’s passing due to delayed release, emphasizing the human cost of these inefficiencies. Biggs noted that while Peters seemed committed to resolving these issues, the solution involves a comprehensive review of federal crimes and better resource allocation to implement the First Step Act properly. Both emphasized the potential $5 billion in savings and advocated for swift changes to improve the system, suggesting that electronic monitoring and home confinement could reduce costs and facilitate smoother transitions for eligible inmates.  Peter Navarro and Mark Mitchell from Rasmussen discussed recent polling data and their meaning for the upcoming election, focusing on a controversial Reuters poll. Navarro opened the discussion with skepticism, suggesting that the poll was "pure propaganda for the left.” The conversation then dove into the methodology behind the poll, with Mitchell explaining why he believes the data is flawed. He emphasized the importance of polling likely voters rather than just registered voters, stating, "Rasmussen always polls likely voters because we think it’s a better reflection of what happens in November.” He argued that the Reuters poll’s sample of registered voters might not accurately predict election outcomes, especially since the entire industry shifts to likely voters as the election approaches. Mitchell also highlighted the recent Republican National Committee (RNC) event’s impact on polling, noting a significant post-RNC bounce for Donald Trump. He contrasted this with the Reuters poll’s surprising findings, which showed Kamala Harris outperforming Joe Biden against Trump, something Mitchell found inconsistent with previous polling trends. “I’ve polled about Kamala Harris a lot of times, and never once in any one of our polls has Kamala Harris ever outperformed Joe Biden,” Mitchell stated, underscoring his doubts about the poll’s credibility. The discussion also covered key election issues, with Mitchell noting that Republicans have an edge on almost every issue that matters to voters, particularly the economy and border security. Navarro and Mitchell agreed that the Democrats’ focus on "Orange man bad, abortion, abortion, abortion” might not resonate as effectively as the Republican emphasis on policy issues. They concluded that the election might hinge more on policy than personality despite the chaotic political climate.  Natalie Winters discussed Kimberly Cheatle’s resignation on Tuesday and told the WarRoom audience that she hopes criminal changes will follow.  In this segment on War Room, Scott Pressler shared significant political developments in Pennsylvania, highlighting a notable shift from Democratic to Republican control in various counties. Pressler celebrated the successful flip of Bucks County, stating, "We together flipped Bucks County, Pennsylvania from Blue to Red. This is something… a County that four years ago had 15,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans now has a plurality of registered Republicans.” He emphasized the importance of this shift for upcoming elections, asserting, "If we are able to win Bucks County, this November we will win Pennsylvania. And therefore, we will win the White House and we will have saved Western Civilization.” Pressler outlined future goals, mentioning, "We are 1,370 voters away from flipping Luzerne County from Blue to Red” and targeting Erie, Chester, Monroe, and Center Counties. He stressed the need for continued voter registration and turnout efforts, saying, "We must be more diligent, we must work harder than ever to continue registering new voters and to turn out these voters.” Addressing challenges, Pressler expressed frustration with Pennsylvania’s Department of State for not providing transparency regarding voter registration data. He criticized their response to concerns about illegal voting, noting, "The automatic photo registration… they say they have checks and balances to ensure that no illegal aliens are getting registered to vote.” Pressler also cautioned against complacency and urged focus on policy over personal attacks. He advised supporters to concentrate on Kamala Harris’s policies rather than her personal attributes, asserting, "I encourage you to focus on policy. This is a woman that spent her career locking up Americans while allowing illegal aliens to break our laws.” Finally, Pressler appealed for support for his organization, Early Vote Action, to further their voter outreach efforts, saying, "If you want direct face-to-face voter contact… please consider chipping in whatever you can.” Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Congressman Tim Burchett discussed significant developments related to Steve Bannon and broader political concerns. Burchett expressed his frustration with the House’s handling of Bannon’s case, highlighting a bill to invalidate the January 6th committee’s subpoenas. He criticized the committee as “invalid” due to its composition. He suggested that its actions, including Bannon’s wrongful conviction, should be reconsidered: “The subpoenas would be invalid, and then Steve Bannon’s wrongful conviction would be invalid.” Natalie Winters echoed Burchett and also lamented the slow response from House Republicans, questioning why significant actions were delayed until just before Bannon’s surrender. He attributed the delay to a lack of courage among GOP members, asserting: “We don’t have any guts,” and criticized the party’s leadership for not prioritizing Bannon’s case over other issues. Regarding security failures, Burchett strongly disapproved of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle, especially regarding the January 6th incident. He accused Cheadle and her team of negligence, suggesting that their incompetence contributed to the harm that occurred: “Clearly, this reeks, it is awful.” He emphasized the need for immediate and thorough investigations into security lapses. Burchett also warned against relying on ineffective oversight committees, predicting that investigations would ultimately lead to calls for more funding rather than substantive results. He emphasized the necessity of electing strong, principled leaders to address the nation’s issues. He criticized the entrenched, compromised figures in both parties: “We need to put strong leaders in and support them.”  In a this conversation with Natalie Winters, Mike McCormick offered his insights into the current political landscape, particularly regarding Kamala Harris’s potential candidacy. McCormick predicted that Kamala Harris would likely become the Democratic nominee, suggesting that the upcoming Chicago convention would be marked by intense political maneuvering and "Chicago thuggery.” He speculated on the dynamics of the Democat convention, noting that while there had been rumors about Michelle Obama potentially entering the race, he believed this was unlikely due to her past dissatisfaction with her time in the White House. McCormick also delved into the relationships and tensions within the Democratic Party. He pointed out that Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden had a history of regular meetings, which he claimed were part of a deal to position Clinton for the 2016 presidential run. McCormick recounted how Biden was reportedly upset about not being able to run for president earlier, a sentiment reflected in some leaked emails involving Biden and Clinton. He did not shy away from criticism of Biden, calling him both a “quitter” and a “criminal,” and referenced his book, The Case for Impeaching Joe Biden, which details alleged criminal activities involving Biden in Ukraine and other controversies.

Brian Glenn opened live from the Bonjangles convention center in Charlotte, North Carolina, with live remarks from rally attendees. Part One:  Part Two of the WarRoom opening includes remarks about the conditions of the Southern Border under Democrat Joe Biden with Kamala Harris as the “Border Czar,” pointing to no change in policy for the American people from the Democrat border policies.  Part Three of the WarRoom live open from the Trump rally in North Carolina:  Max Matheu criticized the Biden administration’s alleged attempts to manipulate elections, arguing that they are using taxpayer dollars to fund voter registration efforts in Native American communities as part of a strategy to influence the 2024 election. He described this as an overhaul of the federal election system, claiming that the Democrats aim to create new voters in key areas to gain an advantage. Matheu also pointed out that federal agencies may not have the authority to conduct these registration efforts, as even ethics attorneys have raised doubts. He urged supporters to stay informed through Heritage Oversight’s social media channels.  In this segment, Max Metheu highlighted concerns about the Secret Service’s handling of phone records related to investigations, stressing the need for transparency and accountability. He criticized the potential loss or mismanagement of these records, arguing that a special or select committee must have the authority to obtain and scrutinize them. Metheu stated that the failure to properly maintain and provide access to phone records indicates a broader issue of systemic corruption within federal agencies, emphasizing that these agencies are not fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. This lack of transparency, he suggests, is part of the “business as usual” approach that allows key information to be swept under the rug, hindering genuine investigation efforts and enabling political manipulation. He further implied that phone records could reveal significant insights into the actions and communications of key figures during critical moments, and their proper examination is essential for uncovering any misconduct or unethical behavior. Metheu insists that only through a special commission with comprehensive investigatory powers can there be a legitimate attempt to address these issues and prevent future occurrences.  In the discussion between Natalie Winters and Julie Kelly, Kelly offers a critical perspective on FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony regarding the January 6th events. She expresses skepticism about Wray’s ability to provide a fair assessment, describing the FBI as “hopelessly corrupt, partisan, and political” under his leadership. Kelly emphasizes the lack of accountability for the construction of the gallows on Capitol grounds, a key symbol of the January 6th insurrection. Despite over three and a half years having passed, she notes that “no one has been identified with constructing those gallows,” highlighting the FBI’s failure to address this aspect of the investigation. Kelly also critiques the FBI’s handling of confidential human sources (CHSs) during the January 6th events. She mentions that during the Proud Boys trial, the DOJ admitted to having 8 to 9 CHSs embedded in the group, but suggests the actual number may have been higher. Furthermore, Kelly references an impending DOJ Inspector General report, which is expected to reveal details about the FBI’s role and the number of informants involved in January 6th. She anticipates this report will be “pretty explosive” and could shed light on the FBI’s activities during that period, questioning whether DOJ officials are delaying its release.

In an interview with Natalie Winters, Catherine Engelbrecht from True the Vote highlighted significant concerns about election integrity, focusing on potential voter fraud linked to ActBlue and non-citizen voting. Engelbrecht described the alleged scheme, where donors unwittingly contribute to Democratic candidates through small, frequent donations under their names, stating, “This is identity theft, this is wire fraud.” Engelbrecht argued that Democrats exploit voter rolls to target defenseless individuals, particularly lower-income ones, who might not fight back. “They are exploiting the defenseless, and it’s disgusting,” she remarked, stressing the necessity for increased citizen involvement. Despite improvements in citizen engagement, Engelbrecht rated election security progress since 2020 as insufficient, around “50%.” She expressed concerns about mail-in voting, deemed the “least secure way” to vote, and criticized the push for it despite security risks. Engelbrecht also highlighted issues with non-citizen registrations, blaming outdated voter roll maintenance and the National Voter Registration Act’s integration with social services, which obscures citizenship verification. Engelbrecht urged for more robust measures, noting, “There is absolute evidence that non-citizens are being registered.” She encouraged citizens to engage in projects like the 611 project to pressure state representatives to clean voter rolls, warning, “We’re running out of time.” Engelbrecht concluded by inviting participation and promoting transparency and accountability in the election process. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters criticized Kamala Harris’s role as the “Border Czar,” emphasizing how media outlets like Axios, The New York Times, and CNN have subtly altered headlines to distance Harris from the border crisis. Winters noted, “They do not want to own what is happening…because they know that it is political suicide,” suggesting that these policies have alienated the Democratic base. The discussion highlighted a distrust in the government, pointing to systemic failures across multiple sectors, from education to public safety. Winters argued that these issues reflect a deeper intention to undermine American interests, claiming, “Our elites are much more sinister, nefarious, calculating, and intentional.” She concluded that it is up to American citizens to challenge these failures, stating that the government is more interested in its agenda than genuinely serving the people. This conversation underscores ongoing concerns about political accountability and public trust.  In a recent discussion with Natalie Winters, Tiffany Justice shared promising developments regarding the Title IX lawsuit that Moms for Liberty is spearheading. Justice highlighted that a judge clarified a previous ruling, allowing current and future members of Moms for Liberty to exempt their children’s schools from the Biden Administration’s new Title IX regulations. She explained, “The judge clarified his order on Friday and said that not only do current Moms for Liberty members qualify…but also any future Moms for Liberty members.” This is a significant victory, as it means that schools associated with Moms for Liberty members are not required to implement these controversial Title IX changes, which include allowing boys on girls’ sports teams, boys in girls’ locker rooms, and withholding information from parents about gender transitions. Justice emphasized the importance of this ruling, stating, “If you’re a Moms for Liberty member, your school cannot enforce those new regulation changes.” She encouraged parents to join the organization, noting that new members can also ensure their child’s school is exempt. Justice thanked the Southeastern Legal Foundation for their support, remarking on their crucial role in this legal battle. To support the cause, she urged people to text "Liberty” to a specific number to join and protect their children’s rights. Part One:  Part Two:  In a discussion with Joe Allen, Connie Elliott, a strategic analyst on the Committee on the Present Danger: China, addresses the intensifying issues of tribalization and political polarization in the digital age. Elliott highlights what she describes as how the “bizarre digital environment” exacerbates these natural problems by creating “digital silos” that foster hatred among individuals. She explains that generative machine learning systems have transformed the information landscape, making traditional information campaigns indistinguishable. These systems optimize information environments, influencing behavior and decision-making. Elliott points out that experiments like Google’s, which manipulated user behavior in crowded environments, demonstrate the power of these systems: “The moment you take the smartphone, you’ve basically signed up for a multitude of psychological experiments.” She also touches on the psychological impact of search engine manipulation and the absence of legal protections against subliminal advertising, stating, “There’s no protection in law at all.” Allen adds that this manipulation contributes to phenomena like “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” where individuals react irrationally to specific triggers.  In a discussion on misinformation, Joe Allen and Shane Cashman explore the concept of “post-reality,” where, according to Cashman, “everything can be true and nothing is true.” They discuss how the internet has accelerated this phenomenon, creating a “mutated fractured world” where people can find information to support any belief with a simple Google search. Cashman highlights how AI and deep fakes exacerbate this issue, making it difficult to discern truth even when witnessing events firsthand. He points to an example where a video allegedly showing a fake conversation between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris was analyzed as a deep fake, illustrating how easily manipulated information can gain traction. Cashman explains, “Even if you’re a witness to it, you don’t really know.” This conversation underscores the challenges of navigating a digital landscape filled with misinformation and manipulated content.  In this discussion with Joe Allen, Tim Hinchcliffe highlights digital identity concerns, emphasizing its role in tracking and controlling individuals. Hinchcliffe notes that digital ID systems are designed to “eliminate all anonymity,” allowing for precise tracking of misinformation sources. He describes these systems as a “never-ending nudge system” to manipulate behavior, potentially leading to social credit systems. Citing the World Economic Forum, Hinchcliffe explains that digital identity determines access to “products, services, and information” and can simultaneously restrict opportunities. While Melinda Gates promotes digital IDs for financial inclusion, Hinchcliffe warns that they serve as a “track and trace” tool, monitoring social media activity, medical records, voting behavior, and more. Quoting Klaus Schwab, he states that monitoring systems are extending to people, creating a world where “authoritarianism is easier” due to “total visibility and traceability.” Hinchcliffe argues that the third world often serves as a “laboratory” for these systems, exploiting desperate populations willing to surrender privacy for access.

Representative Bob Good expresses frustration with Congress’s lack of progress on key issues, criticizing House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to send Congress on a District work period in August. Good argues that Congress should have stayed in session to address the nation’s pressing issues and complete the necessary spending bills. He stated, “the point is still well made by the Speaker promised back early in the year that if we didn’t complete our 12 required spending bills, he would cancel the August recess.” Good blames Congress’s inefficiency on a “lack of resolve” and “toughness” within the Republican Party, leading to continuous concessions to the Senate. Good also highlights the need for effective investigations into significant issues, including the Secret Service’s role in alleged election interference, stating, “There would be no basis for confidence based on past history, but we do have the opportunity to be different this time.” He calls for a task force composed of “real Fighters” to ensure accountability. Ultimately, Good questions the Republican Party’s ability to deliver meaningful results for the American people, warning that continued failure may undermine public trust. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters expresses her thoughts and ideas about Congress being on Recess now, saying she is unhappy about that Speaker Johnson didn’t keep his word to hold Congress to address spending bills.  Trevor Loudon, an investigative reporter, highlights Kamala Harris’s alleged connections to radical leftist circles and Chinese communist influence. He points out that Harris’s father was a “bonafide Marxist economist,” and throughout her career, she has been influenced by Marxist circles, including figures like Willie Brown, a long-time Communist Party supporter. Loudon argues that Harris’s rise in politics is supported by Steve Phillips, a Maoist who aims to mobilize minority groups and progressive whites to shift America towards socialism. He emphasizes Harris’s focus on racial politics, noting her support for Black Lives Matter and its alleged ties to Chinese communist organizations. Loudon suggests that Harris is “the most left-wing candidate” and warns of her potential influence on policies, particularly regarding immigration and racial issues. He also claims that Chinese-linked organizations are working to mobilize voters to secure Harris’s political success. Loudon stresses the need for awareness of these influences in American politics. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Miranda Devine’s article for the New York Post exposes significant issues within the FBI, highlighting a lack of confidence from local law enforcement. According to whistleblower reports, local police view the FBI as politically biased and acting as enforcers for the Biden Department of Justice. This mistrust intensified after the FBI’s actions following the January 6th Capitol riot, where non-violent Trump supporters were aggressively pursued. The FBI’s raid on Donald Trump’s residence in Florida further eroded trust, causing local cops nationwide to believe the agency is corrupt. As a result, police are reluctant to share intelligence with the FBI, raising concerns for national security and public safety. The recent assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, exemplifies these issues, showcasing failures in cooperation between the FBI, Secret Service, and local law enforcement. Devine emphasizes that partisan bias and incompetence within these agencies compromise their ability to effectively protect national figures and the public. Part One:  Part Two:  In a recent interview, T.J. Harker emphasized the need to end the Federal Reserve and control fiat currency, aligning with libertarian views. He discussed his article on the “post-constitutional order” in America, which drew criticism from the Cato Institute. Harker questioned whether a constitutional order still exists, suggesting it’s either dead or on life support. He highlighted the misuse of the legal system, known as “lawfare,” where the criminal justice system is weaponized against political opponents. Harker argued that figures like federal prosecutor Jack Smith and district attorneys Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg could be prosecuted under existing laws for their actions against Donald Trump. He suggested that these prosecutions are politically motivated, with broad statutes allowing for the criminalization of legitimate conduct. Harker also speculated on Kamala Harris’s political strategy, given her prosecutorial background. He suggested that she might gain political advantage by dismissing federal cases against Trump, framing it as an effort to unify the country and restore the rule of law. However, he acknowledged that such a move is unlikely. Overall, Harker emphasized the importance of addressing these legal and political issues to maintain a fair constitutional order.  Tim Hinchcliffe discussed the evolving field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and their intersection with globalism and politics. He criticized Yuval Noah Harari and Nina Farahani for their strong but pessimistic views on BCIs, which they argue could have more risks than benefits. Despite their high-profile platforms, like the World Economic Forum, Hinchliffe is skeptical of their motives, suggesting that these figures might warn about and exploit the technology’s potential. Hinchcliffe outlined the current state of BCIs, from non-invasive devices like smart tattoos to invasive technologies such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which aims to restore mobility in disabled patients. He noted that while Harari and Farahani are vocal about the dangers of these technologies, the World Economic Forum seems to balance concern with enthusiasm for their possibilities. He highlighted a shift from the Internet of Things to the Internet of Bodies and, eventually, the Internet of Brains, where BCIs could enable brain-to-brain communication and shared thoughts. Hinchcliffe warned that this could lead to manipulative "memetic warfare,” where narratives shape behavior and policies without relying on concrete data. He urged caution, particularly with right-wing figures involved in transhumanism and their potential influence on policy, given their connections to defense and intelligence agencies.

Dave Brat and Rosemary Jenks discussed the Immigration Accountability Project (IAP) on the War Room, highlighting the critical need for accountability in immigration policy. Jenks emphasized that holding politicians accountable, including the Biden Administration and DHS Secretary Mayorkas, is essential. She criticized current immigration practices, stating that many immigrants enter illegally, and policies like “parole” are abused to allow quasi-legal entry. Jenks noted that Mexico is more effectively securing its border than the U.S., partly to help the Biden Administration claim lower illegal immigration numbers. She cited a House Judiciary Committee report revealing the Biden Administration has released 5.3 million illegal immigrants into the U.S., with an additional 1.9 million known “gotaways.” Jenks argued that an incoming administration, like Trump’s, should terminate parole programs and reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy to prevent catch and release. She also highlighted the economic and social costs of illegal immigration, including crime and strain on public resources, and described the deadly impact of fentanyl smuggling by Mexican cartels with Chinese assistance. The IAP aims to hold accountable those responsible for these immigration issues.  Colonel John Mills, retired, and Dave Brat discussed the geopolitical landscape, emphasizing the influence of China on various global conflicts. Mills identified at least 14 regional conflicts, many of which he linked to China’s strategic ambitions to undermine the U.S. He highlighted major hot spots including Ukraine, where he described Russia as acting as a proxy for China, and the Middle East, where Iranian-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are significantly influenced by China. Mills also pointed out China’s presence in Latin America, including Chinese spy bases in Cuba and involvement with drug cartels. He emphasized the rise of populist leaders in the region who are pro-American but are receiving minimal support from the U.S. administration. In Asia, Mills discussed China’s strategic moves in Taiwan and the Solomon Islands, suggesting that China is bypassing direct confrontation with Taiwan by securing other strategic locations. Mills criticized the current U.S. administration’s lack of clarity, resolve, and authenticity in foreign policy, contrasting it with the previous administration’s success in maintaining peace and prosperity. He argued for a robust policy that includes cutting off financial resources to China, strengthening diplomatic, military, and intelligence efforts, and showing genuine commitment to strategic partners.  Dave Walsh, a War Room energy expert, provided insights on the Biden administration’s recent energy policies and their global implications. He criticized the release of 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, highlighting its negligible impact on U.S. gas prices given the country’s high daily consumption. Walsh emphasized the bipartisan responsibility, noting that many Republicans also supported the reserve’s depletion. Walsh discussed the geopolitical landscape, particularly the increased flow of Russian pipeline gas into Western Europe, despite ongoing conflicts and sanctions. He pointed out that Europe continues to rely on significant quantities of Russian LNG, contradicting their support for the Ukraine war effort. This reliance has led to increased U.S. exports of LNG and crude oil to Europe, which in turn has affected domestic energy prices. Regarding China, Walsh mentioned their strategic energy alignments, including pipeline projects with Russia, Iran, and Iraq, which will secure their energy needs in the long term. Meanwhile, China has capitalized on boycotted Russian oil supplies. Walsh concluded by stressing the need for the U.S. to educate its representatives on energy policies and their geopolitical consequences.  EJ Antoni and Dave Brat discussed the implications of a potential Trump presidency on the U.S. economy, particularly in relation to the bond market. Antoni critiqued the Wall Street Journal’s negative outlook on Trump’s return, arguing that similar predictions in 2016 proved unfounded. He highlighted that Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies previously bolstered manufacturing and wages without causing inflation, contrary to critics’ claims. Antoni explained that the current rise in interest rates is due to increased debt and concerns about the Treasury’s ability to repay, exacerbated by the Biden administration’s policies. He contended that Trump’s economic policies would alleviate stress on the Treasury markets, as they did during his first term. The expectation of strong economic growth under Trump would likely shift investments from low-yield bonds to higher-return stocks, forcing the Treasury to offer more competitive yields. Antoni emphasized that the current economic challenges are a result of existing policies, not future Trump policies, and predicted that a Trump presidency would restore robust economic growth, attracting investments away from low-yield bonds to more lucrative opportunities.  Natalie Winters and Ken Klippenstein explored the weaponization of the federal government against critics of the ruling class. Winters introduced Klippenstein, an investigative journalist known for exposing the collusion between big tech and federal agencies. They focused on Klippenstein’s latest findings about the IRS, which allegedly targets individuals threatening the government’s ability to govern, as outlined in new documents he obtained. Klippenstein explained that the IRS manual prioritizes criminal investigations based on national security implications, a shift from traditional targets like foreign terror groups to domestic groups post-2021. This realignment intensified after events like January 6th and the George Floyd protests, leading to the creation of a domestic terrorism strategy under Biden. The conversation highlighted the IRS’s expanded role in national security, working closely with agencies like the FBI and Homeland Security. Despite increased funding for the IRS, Klippenstein argued that the lack of transparency fuels public distrust and conspiracy theories. He emphasized the importance of primary source documentation in investigative reporting to uncover the true scope of these governmental actions. Klippenstein also discussed the challenges journalists face due to the government’s secretive nature and the media’s reliance on authorized disclosures and information from think tanks and advocacy groups. He encouraged readers to engage with primary sources to form their own conclusions about these critical issues.  In a conversation between Tiffany Justice from Moms for Liberty and Natalie Winters, Justice shared news about a legal victory against Title IX changes proposed by the Biden Administration. The victory in the 10th Circuit means that public schools in Kansas, Alaska, Utah, and Wyoming cannot implement the new Title IX changes, which aimed to redefine sex to include gender identity and sexual orientation. This ruling impacts schools attended by members of Young America’s Foundation, Female Athletes United, and Moms for Liberty members. Justice explained that the judge ruled the changes as unconstitutional, violating the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. She urged listeners to join Moms for Liberty by July 15 to ensure their schools are protected from these changes. The discussion also covered the Biden Administration’s shifting stance on gender-affirming care for minors. Despite recent claims of opposition to gender surgeries for kids, the Administration continues to support gender-affirming care, which Justice criticized. She emphasized that the Administration’s push for gender ideology is losing public support and could affect their chances in future elections. Justice concluded by urging parents to join Moms for Liberty to protect their children and public schools from the implementation of these Title IX changes.  Mike Benz discussed President Joe Biden’s perceived cognitive decline and its implications for national security, criticizing Biden’s longstanding role within the Washington establishment. Benz emphasized the Democratic Party’s desperation to find a suitable successor due to Biden’s inability to win the next election, pointing out the lack of candidates with the necessary foreign policy and intelligence experience. He highlighted Hunter Biden’s increasing involvement in White House affairs, contradicting previous claims of no business discussions between Joe and Hunter Biden, and suggested Hunter’s involvement stems from his deep ties to national security and international business. Benz expressed surprise at the intelligence community’s silence on Biden’s health issues, given their potential national security implications. He also mentioned key figures like Kamala Harris and Mike Donilon, noting their potential roles in maintaining continuity in the Democratic leadership, and highlighted BlackRock’s influence through figures like Tom Donilon. Additionally, Benz described USAID as a front for CIA operations, detailing its involvement in international interventions and suggesting it plays a significant role in the current immigration crisis. He noted Samantha Power’s influence in USAID and her husband’s new position at the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting their involvement in shaping immigration policies. Overall, Benz depicted a deeply interconnected political and intelligence establishment maneuvering strategically in response to Biden’s limitations.

EJ Antoni and Dave Brat discussed the negative impact of the Biden administration’s economic policies, highlighting the contrast with the Trump era. Antoni pointed out that Trump’s administration fostered free-flowing capital markets, making it easier for the government and private sectors to obtain financing. In contrast, the current administration has eroded confidence in the U.S. dollar, leading to its devaluation and higher interest rates on various loans due to reckless spending by the radical left. They argued that Biden is merely a figurehead with a real economic agenda driven by more radical elements. The discussion emphasized the significant loss in purchasing power affecting all aspects of life, including retirement savings, and the increased financial strain on retirees. Antoni also criticized inflation statistics as misleading, suggesting they understate the real economic pain. The conversation concluded with a call for hedging investments and recognizing that the current economic situation is unsustainable, urging a return to policies that ensure prosperity and financial stability.  In a discussion on the War Room, Dave Brat and Liz Harrington delved into the current political state, emphasizing a constitutional crisis since November 3, 2020, due to Joe Biden’s ineffectiveness as a commander-in-chief. Harrington criticized Biden as a mere figurehead, suggesting the country is run by unaccountable elites manipulating the media and government through intelligence agencies. She highlighted the influence of globalists and elite figures controlling national and global policies, asserting that Trump, independent and accountable only to the American people, disrupts this power structure. Harrington expressed hope for Trump’s return to restoring a robust executive and dismantling corruption, citing some favorable Supreme Court rulings as a sign of resilience. She underscored the necessity of re-electing Trump to revive constitutional governance and hinted at internal power dynamics within the Biden family, suggesting Jill Biden’s struggle to maintain control. Harrington concluded by sharing her social media handles, encouraging followers to stay updated on her advocacy for the War Room’s message.  In their conversation, Dave Brat and Mike Howell from the Heritage Foundation discuss the critical issues facing the United States, mainly focusing on border security and its implications for elections. Howell highlights Heritage’s extensive research exposing vulnerabilities in the electoral system due to illegal aliens being registered to vote. He emphasizes the alarming potential impact on elections, citing findings from North Carolina as indicative of a larger threat nationwide. Heritage’s efforts include legal challenges against NGOs facilitating illegal activities and advocating for legislative measures to prevent non-citizens from voting. They criticize the Biden administration for its perceived laxity on border control, accusing it of potentially exploiting illegal votes for electoral advantage. Howell stresses Heritage’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting election integrity against what they perceive as systemic vulnerabilities exacerbated by immigration policies. Their discussion underscores deep concerns about national security and the integrity of American elections amidst ongoing political turmoil and legislative battles.  In a recent War Room discussion, Bradley Thayer and Dave Brat highlighted America’s vulnerabilities amid President Biden’s perceived leadership failures. Thayer pointed to China’s aggressive geopolitical moves under Xi Jinping, including alliances and pressure on regional allies like Taiwan and the Philippines. Brat criticized bipartisan support for engaging with China, arguing it undermines U.S. sovereignty. Both stressed the need to shift from corporate interests benefiting China to bolstering U.S. security and independence. Their analysis underscored the urgent call for a strategic reorientation to confront external threats and internal divisions, advocating for policies that prioritize America’s long-term national interests.  Judge Gableman criticized Wisconsin’s State Supreme Court, controlled by leftist Democrats, for legalizing unsupervised dropboxes, overturning a previous ruling. He argued this decision compromises election security and undermines public confidence in the judiciary. Gableman highlighted the absurdity of the majority’s reasoning, where any municipal clerk, despite potential fraud risks, can collect ballots under the guise of being a “person.” He emphasized the ruling’s potential to facilitate fraud and accused justices of prioritizing politics over judicial integrity. The discussion underscored concerns about electoral fairness and judicial impartiality in Wisconsin.  Natalie Winters talked about an article she wrote about the War Games for Droughts and Blackouts.  Noor Bid Laden discussed how the Biden administration’s leadership flaws have damaged America’s image abroad, portraying it as ungovernable and chaotic. She criticized Biden’s alleged incompetence, claiming he was propped up by Democrat mega-donors rather than chosen by voters. She cited a tweet by David Sachs highlighting conspiracy theories now acknowledged as true, suggesting a deliberate effort to discredit the U.S. globally. Bid Laden argued that these tactics aim to undermine American sovereignty in favor of a centralized globalist agenda. She urged a return to America First policies to restore independence and counteract these globalist influences.  Speaking on the War Room podcast, Darren Beattie discussed the current turmoil within the Democratic Party regarding President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. He highlighted the media’s role in downplaying concerns over Biden’s health despite growing speculation and internal Democratic disarray. Beattie pointed out that the media’s previous gaslighting of Biden’s health now complicates efforts to remove him, as it would be seen as admitting their complicity. He emphasized Kamala Harris’s conspicuous silence regarding her proximity to the January 6th events, suggesting it contradicts the narrative pushed by Democrats about the seriousness of that day. Beattie speculated that Democrats, despite internal dissent and media scrutiny, may not replace Biden due to fears of electoral repercussions and a lack of viable alternatives within their ranks. He urged continued scrutiny on these issues, particularly Kamala Harris’s role and the media’s credibility in shaping public perception.  Libby Emmons discussed the recent decision by Judge LaShia Miles to withhold the manifesto of Audrey Hale, the transgender Covenant School shooter. The judge cited copyright concerns, granting rights to the victims’ families, and feared that releasing the manifesto could inspire copycat crimes. Michael Patrick Leahy of the Tennessee Star attempted to obtain these documents, even facing contempt charges for protecting his sources. Emmons highlighted that Hale admired the Columbine shooters and had unreported homicidal ideations during therapy. Emmons criticized the media’s response, noting the immediate focus on trans rights following the shooting rather than addressing the incident’s gravity. She argued that leftist media often spins narratives to vilify conservatives, Trump supporters, and the MAGA movement. Emmons pointed out the media’s bias in handling such events, suggesting a double standard when it comes to anti-trans or conservative-related violence. She emphasized the importance of critical thinking and maintaining personal values amidst pervasive media bias, urging vigilance against misinformation. Emmons underscored that America’s future depends on citizens who can discern the truth, advocating for clear-headedness and resistance against media-driven falsehoods. She can be followed on Twitter and through her work at The Post Millennial and Human Events.  Jeffrey Tucker, president of the Brownstone Institute, criticizes the latest economic data, particularly the June jobs report, highlighting discrepancies and inaccuracies. He notes that the reported 206,000 non-farm payroll jobs include significant revisions and an increase in government and healthcare jobs, while sectors like leisure and hospitality lag. Tucker argues that the official unemployment rate, currently at 4.1%, underestimates real unemployment, which he suggests could be closer to 8% when considering those who have left the workforce. Tucker is skeptical of the official inflation data, believing it severely underreports the true rate of inflation. He cites personal examples, such as a 70% increase in the price of paper towels over 16 months, and a 100% rise in olive oil prices within a year, to illustrate his point. He argues that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excludes many relevant costs like taxes, insurance, and new fees, leading to an inaccurate representation of inflation. According to Tucker, real inflation could be between 35% and 50% over the last few years. He also criticizes the reporting of GDP, claiming that nominal GDP growth is misleading due to government spending. Adjusted for a more realistic inflation rate, Tucker believes the U.S. GDP has contracted significantly, indicating a recession or even a depression. Tucker blames both outdated data collection methods and intentional obfuscation by government agencies for these inaccuracies. He suggests that the Biden administration might be manipulating economic data to present a more favorable picture ahead of elections.

Steve Bannon and Lance Wallnau discussed the role of Christian nationalism in American politics, particularly under the Trump administration in 2025. Bannon introduced Wallnau as a key voice in the movement, emphasizing its growth as a response to what they see as leftist overreach and anti-Christian bias within the federal government.
Wallnau defined Christian nationalism as an extension of traditional nationalism, prioritizing national sovereignty and cultural preservation while rejecting ideologies like communism and transgender policies. He argued that the left has mischaracterized the movement as “white Christian nationalism” to delegitimize it.
The discussion touched on efforts to remove anti-Christian bias in the government, with Bannon highlighting Pam Bondi’s role in leading a federal task force on religious discrimination. They framed Trump as an unlikely but effective champion for Christian causes, suggesting his leadership disrupts the establishment’s grip on power.
Bannon and Wallnau also criticized government agencies, particularly USAID, as infiltrated by “demonic” influences, echoing broader concerns about deep-state corruption. They pointed to cases like the Idaho National Guard’s alleged exclusion of Christian officers as evidence of systemic bias against religious conservatives.
Overall, the conversation positioned Trump and his allies as warriors in a spiritual and political battle to reclaim America’s Christian identity.
Dave Brat and Steve Bannon discussed the resurgence of Christian nationalism and its impact on American politics. Brat emphasized Trump’s renewed faith following an assassination attempt, quoting his remarks on America’s divine mission and the need to restore religion. Lance Wallnau highlighted America’s history of religious awakenings and the current push for a Christian reformation, stressing the need to recapture institutions like media, business, and government.
He outlined a three-pronged approach: legislation, litigation, and shaping public opinion. They discussed the Supreme Court case on Catholic charter schools as a crucial battle for religious freedom and school choice. Bannon noted the left’s fear of Christian nationalism, calling it a potent ideological force. Brat underscored the necessity for Christian leaders to be bold and active in shaping culture. The discussion framed faith as central to America’s future and a tool to counter globalist influences.
Steve Bannon warns that the government is heading toward a shutdown on March 14, 2025, unless serious budget cuts are made. He criticizes House and Senate leadership for repeatedly passing continuing resolutions (CRs) instead of addressing spending issues. Bannon highlights that Rep. Thomas Massie was the only Republican to vote against the last funding bill, which merely delayed the crisis.
He stresses that USAID and other spending programs will continue unless major structural changes occur. He argues that President Trump’s first-year budget in a second term could end up resembling a Biden-Pelosi budget if no action is taken. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $2 trillion deficit, which Bannon calls unsustainable.
He criticizes Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate leaders for failing to cut unnecessary expenditures, particularly at the Pentagon. Bannon insists that reconciliation bills must include real spending reductions, not just promises of future cuts. He calls for immediate action, warning that rising debt and inflation will worsen without decisive leadership.
Ultimately, he urges conservatives to fight against another long-term CR, warning that failure to act will trap Trump’s administration in a financial mess created by the current government.

In their discussion, Dave Brat and Steve Bannon outline their concerns about U.S. federal spending and taxation. Bannon critiques the current system, emphasizing how politicians rely on “fantasyland” figures like EBITDA while ignoring cash flow. He stresses that proper financial accountability comes from understanding the balance sheet and actual cash, not the inflated figures often presented. Brat criticizes the lack of political will to cut federal spending, highlighting the absurdity of temporary solutions like continuing resolutions.
Bannon, in turn, supports President Trump’s tax proposals, particularly those that eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security. He champions these ideas as vital for the middle and working class, strongly backing Trump’s efforts. However, both recognize the more significant issue of growing deficits, warning that while tax cuts are pro-growth, they must be paired with substantial spending cuts. Bannon argues that cuts should start with discretionary spending, including defense, where he believes costs can be reduced without compromising security. They agree on the necessity of addressing waste in social programs and foreign aid. Ultimately, they conclude that either spending must be drastically reduced or additional taxes must be found to balance the budget and ensure long-term financial stability.

Part Two:
John Amanchukwu talked about his foundation and the repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which he supported.
Steve Bannon critiques U.S. foreign aid, particularly USAID, calling it a wasteful “slush fund” and a tool for political control. He links it to the CIA and its role in shaping global policy, including funding NGOs at the southern border and suppressing free speech. He argues that Republican leadership, particularly figures like Paul Ryan, failed to audit or meaningfully review these activities, which enabled Democrats to run wild. Bannon also criticizes the U.S.’s imperialist tendencies post-WWII, and the Pentagon’s entanglement with Silicon Valley, which he sees as a source of political corruption. He stresses the urgency of cutting federal spending, especially in the face of growing threats from China, and advocates for stronger action against the Chinese Communist Party. Bannon suggests disengagement from Ukraine, especially considering its mineral resources, and questions the effectiveness of U.S. foreign military commitments. He concludes with a call for more pragmatic, American-centered policies.

Jayne Zirkle reported live from the tarmac in West Palm Beach, where she awaited the arrival of President Trump, giving updates on Turmp’s schedule and some commentary about events that Trump and his team would be attending.
Part One:
Part Two:
Steve Bannon called in to react to the announcement that President Trump had ordered a full audit of the Department of Defense, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had affirmed and had already said he would prepare for.
Jack Posobiec gives his analysis of a potential ceasefire in the Ukraine War. Posobiec highlighted potential ceasefire negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, aligning with President Trump’s campaign commitment to ending the war. According to Posobiec, Ukrainian sources leaked details of a phased peace proposal, including direct talks between Zelensky and Putin. Russian media has reported that potential meetings could be held in Saudi Arabia or Dubai, underscoring the role of energy interests—particularly oil, natural gas, and Nord Stream 2—as key drivers behind the war.
Posobiec noted that Zelensky has made bold demands, including nuclear weapons—which he is unlikely to receive—as well as NATO-led peacekeeping forces, particularly under British leadership, to establish a demilitarized zone in contested regions. These areas include Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea, and Zaporizhzhia, where pro-Russian sentiment and prior votes to join Russia complicate negotiations.
Trump has previously emphasized Ukraine’s vast reserves of rare earth minerals, lithium, iron, and zinc, suggesting they could play a role in any potential peace deal. Posobiec drew parallels to Trump’s past stance on foreign conflicts, referencing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Iraq without economic benefits. He speculated that any agreement might include resource concessions tied to a ceasefire, aligning with Trump’s America First vision.

Bill Federer emphasized the historical significance of faith in American leadership, citing past presidents who acknowledged God in governance. He referenced Eisenhower’s assertion that belief in a Supreme Being is foundational to Americanism, ensuring that rights come from a higher authority, not the state. Federer highlighted historical instances of national prayer and fasting, from Washington to Roosevelt, demonstrating faith’s role in national crises. He criticized efforts to remove Christianity from public life under Obama, arguing that Trump is addressing this bias. He concluded that Christianity uniquely upholds human dignity, emphasizing that all people are equal as they are made in God’s image.
E.J. Antoni criticized the reliability of labor statistics, arguing that they are distorted due to flawed Census Bureau data and the inclusion of illegal immigrants. He pointed out that red states like Texas and Florida were undercounted, affecting congressional representation, while blue states were overcounted. Despite massive deficits and inflation, Antoni emphasized that job growth has not benefited American citizens. He warned about cartel-related threats at the southern border and suggested stronger financial and military measures. He also highlighted market volatility due to Trump’s trade policies and the broader economic instability under current leadership.

Jerry Dunleavy, a former senior investigator on the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Afghanistan investigation, resigned in frustration over what he describes as an ineffective and unserious probe. Initially an investigative reporter covering the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, Dunleavy joined the committee to seek accountability. However, he found that witnesses were treated too gently, key figures were never called, and crucial questions were left unanswered. Dunleavy criticized Chairman McCaul for not fulfilling promises to thoroughly investigate the events, particularly regarding the bombing at Kabul Airport. He expressed deep concern that future military failures could lead to more unnecessary casualties without proper accountability. Dunleavy emphasized, “Inaction is really non-excusable,” especially when there’s power to compel testimony and documents. He hopes that public pressure might push the committee to fulfill its responsibilities.  Theo Wold argues that the recent surge in naturalization efforts is a strategic move by the left to reshape the electorate before the 2024 election. He points out that naturalization trends have declined over the last few decades. Still, recent efforts by the Biden administration are expediting the process to ensure new citizens can vote. Wold highlights the administrative state’s role in pushing policies they favor while dragging their feet on those they oppose, stating, "If it’s an idea they like, they’ll move expeditiously.” He warns that this selective efficiency could significantly impact the upcoming election, emphasizing the need for more robust policies to counteract these efforts.  Natalie Winters gave some of her thoughts and ideas on what the Deep State is doing.  In response to his ministry being entangled in legal battles initiated by Democrats just before their convention in Chicago, Mike Lindell is offering his book for free. The book details his journey to sobriety from crack addiction and the development of his ministry, which Democrats are now pushing to shut down.  Congressman Tim Burchett told the WarRoom that he has been actively working to address concerns about Tulsi Gabbard being placed on a “Quiet Skies” watch list, which has led to her being followed by agents through airports. Burchett finds this surveillance alarming and is demanding answers, emphasizing that if it can happen to her, it could happen to others. He criticizes unelected bureaucrats for overreaching and violating constitutional rights, likening the situation to other government abuses, such as labeling concerned parents and peaceful protesters as domestic terrorists. Burchett expresses frustration with the lack of accountability in Washington, blaming a system influenced by lobbyists and entrenched bureaucrats. He calls for a stronger push against wasteful spending and government overreach, criticizing both Democrats and moderate Republicans for their roles in allowing these issues to persist. Burchett also supports cutting bureaucratic staff in Washington by 75% and advocates for electing leaders like Matt Gaetz, who he believes stand firm against corruption. He warns that if these issues aren’t addressed, the country risks losing its freedoms and facing further bureaucratic abuses.  Dr. Robert Malone, in a discussion, expressed his views on the political dynamics surrounding Donald Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Malone suggests that Fauci, despite being lobbed softballs by CNN to paint Trump as a threat of political retaliation, did not take the bait. Instead, Fauci’s comments implied he does not expect a Trump administration to engage in political vendettas, unlike what Malone perceives as the approach taken by the Biden-Harris administration. Malone criticizes Fauci’s past actions and statements but notes a surprising neutrality in Fauci’s anticipation of Trump’s potential actions if re-elected. Malone interprets this as Trump focusing on broader issues rather than political revenge, despite ample reasons for accountability due to alleged lies to Congress by Fauci and his subordinates. Malone personally would favor seeing accountability but acknowledges the more pressing need for Trump to address larger national problems. He also mentions his upcoming speaking engagement at the Liberty Forum in Silicon Valley, where he plans to discuss topics like weaponized fear and psychological bio-terrorism. Malone’s analysis reflects a complex interplay of political expectations and personal convictions regarding justice and governance priorities.  Father Calvin Robinson and Lawrence Fox shared their views on the state of politics and society in the UK during their appearance on War Room. Robinson, who was blocked from ordination in the Church of England due to his “biblical views on gender and sexuality,” expressed concerns about the lack of representation for the working-class in Britain. He appreciated Elon Musk’s recent comments about civil unrest, stating, “Thank goodness we have an ally,” highlighting the establishment’s disconnect from ordinary citizens. Fox, head of the Reclaim Party, echoed these sentiments, criticizing the current political landscape: “We have a uni-party because we have a two-party system.” He lamented the lack of true opposition to what he described as a “far-left government” and warned that the British people lack a political voice, leading to potential unrest. Both Robinson and Fox agreed that the UK’s two-tiered system is deeply problematic, with Robinson emphasizing that “we live in a two-tier society,” where people from certain demographics face harsher consequences for minor infractions while others commit serious crimes with impunity. They concluded that people power might be the only solution to the deep-seated issues facing the nation, with Fox predicting that future protests could see “a million” people marching, forcing the government to take notice.  Todd Bensman, reporting from Panama’s Darien Gap, highlights the region’s critical role as a migration bottleneck where over 1.5 million migrants, including individuals from Muslim-majority countries, Africa, and China, pass through on their way to the U.S. border. Bensman underscores the national security threat posed by this route, noting that Panama has recently captured several terrorists among the migrants. Despite Panama’s new president, Raul Molino, vowing to close the Darien Gap and deport migrants instead of releasing them, he faces challenges due to the lack of promised support from the U.S. “Where are the Americans? They’re gone. You promised us aid and assistance, and there’s nothing going on with that,” Bensman quotes Molino. This failure to act, Bensman argues, is a missed opportunity to enhance U.S. national security. He also criticizes the U.S. diplomatic approach, emphasizing the need for stronger measures, such as sanctions or visa restrictions, to incentivize cooperation from transit countries like Colombia. Bensman warns that the migration crisis will continue to escalate without decisive action.  Billboard Chris Elston criticized the controversial practice of drag queen story hours for young children. He argued, “They’re trying to recruit little kids into the cult of gender into queer Theory,” calling it a misguided effort to normalize gender transitions among children. He highlighted the alarming statistics on gender dysphoria treatments, noting, “More than 300,000 children aged 12 to 17 have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria,” and criticized the trend of performing surgeries on minors, including “6,000 double mastectomies” in recent years. Elston also stressed that this issue resonates strongly with voters. “The loudest cheers at Trump’s CPAC speech came when he vowed to stop the chemical castration of children,” he said, indicating widespread public concern. He believes that action from all branches of government is necessary, urging legislative and judicial interventions to halt what he describes as “child abuse.” Elston presents a stark call to action, emphasizing the urgent need for both effective border management and protective measures against the sexualization of children. “Parents need to put their foot down,” Chris concludes, underscoring the critical nature of these issues in shaping the future of U.S. policy.

Julie Kelly discussed potential cover-ups involving missing Secret Service text messages from January 5th and 6th, 2021. She highlighted that these messages, belonging to at least 24 Secret Service officials, including key personnel like the director and Kimberly Cheatle, were deleted, raising concerns about obstruction of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General, Joseph Cuffari. Kelly pointed out that DHS attempted to prevent Cuffari from accessing related emails and other correspondence and even sought to redact portions of the report before it was released to Congress and the public. She emphasized the broader implications of this cover-up, suggesting it reflects a “systemic” effort to withhold critical information from the public. Kelly also noted that despite being labeled as conspiracy theorists, those questioning the official narrative have been vindicated as more information comes to light. She concluded by mentioning the developing scandal, including recent concerns raised by Senator Charles Grassley about DHS’s handling of the investigation into the alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13th. Kelly described these events as part of a larger interagency cover-up, including the ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden and related political figures.  Natalie Winters outlined her reasoning for resisting party unity with Republicans before the November election. They discussed her negative feelings about them and why she is frustrated.  Theo Wold criticized the Democrats’ newly codified platform as radically transformative, particularly concerning immigration policies. He highlighted that the platform endorses the Citizenship Act, which proposes to legalize 15.5 million undocumented immigrants who entered unlawfully under President Biden. The Act also offers these individuals free housing, healthcare, and legal representation and introduces the term “prospective lawful immigrant” to replace “illegal alien,” thereby eliminating distinctions between citizens and foreign nationals. Wold argued that the Act would also expedite green card eligibility for illegal immigrants, even those with criminal records, and shockingly, use taxpayer money to bring deported individuals back to the U.S. for citizenship. He described the platform as a fundamental, anti-American transformation, blending Marxist, feminist, queer theory, and open borders policies to erase distinctions between American citizens and foreign nationals. Wold questioned whether Republicans have the political will to combat this radical shift and expressed concerns about the feasibility of mass deportations, emphasizing the need for more stringent immigration enforcement and the use of modern tools to discourage illegal immigration. He also criticized former Republicans who now oppose Trump, accusing them of supporting this radical agenda out of personal animosity.  Mike Benz criticized the Democrats’ platform as fundamentally radical and anti-American, particularly focusing on immigration policies. He emphasized that the platform’s endorsement of the Citizenship Act would legalize millions of undocumented immigrants, offering them free housing, healthcare, and legal representation. Benz noted that the Act eliminates the distinction between citizens and foreign nationals by replacing terms like “illegal alien” with “prospective lawful immigrant.” He argued that this approach effectively dissolves U.S. sovereignty and expedites citizenship for even those with criminal records. Benz also highlighted the platform’s broader agenda, which he described as a mix of Marxist, feminist, and queer theories aiming to erase the difference between tax-paying citizens and foreign nationals. He questioned whether Republicans have the resolve to oppose this shift and criticized former Republicans who now oppose Trump, accusing them of enabling this radical agenda out of personal animosity.  Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell discussed their concerns over Steve Bannon’s treatment by the Bureau of Prisons, alleging that Bannon is being unfairly targeted by Attorney General Merrick Garland’s office. Giuliani emphasized his experience running the Bureau of Prisons, noting that Bannon is being treated differently than other prisoners, with his case seemingly manipulated at higher levels of government. Lindell supported these claims, stressing the importance of alternative media platforms like Frank Speech to counter mainstream narratives. He also promoted his MyPillow products, tying them to the broader effort to support Bannon and the War Room. Lindell shared his experiences of being attacked by various authorities, including the Minnesota Attorney General, who he claimed was targeting his charitable efforts. Both Giuliani and Lindell framed these issues within a broader context of political warfare, emphasizing the importance of resisting what they view as an increasingly authoritarian government.  Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell criticized the handling of a political convention, particularly the late-night timing of a speech, suggesting it was intentionally scheduled to minimize viewership. They speculated that the speaker might harbor resentment for being sidelined, leading to his exclusion from more prominent time slots. Lindell emphasized the importance of alternative media, like Frank Speech, to highlight disillusioned Democrats now supporting Trump, with plans to feature interviews showcasing their reasons for switching allegiance. The conversation also touched on Giuliani’s and Lindell’s concerns about political persecution, referencing Steve Bannon’s imprisonment and the broader implications for free speech and political dissent. They encouraged their audience to stay informed and support efforts to challenge mainstream narratives.

Scott Pressler emphasized the growing struggles for Democrats, pointing out that as voters hear more from Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, their polling worsens. He highlighted that Trump is gaining ground in Pennsylvania, where his organization, Early Vote Action, is heavily focused. “The data is reflecting that the honeymoon is over,” Pressler noted, indicating that even with Democrats sidelining Biden and Harris bringing in Tim Walz, Republicans are still out-registering Democrats across Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. Pressler stressed the importance of economic issues in the upcoming election, stating that voters are increasingly motivated by concerns over the economy, peace, and immigration. He mentioned hearing from voters who have never voted before but are now registering because “life was easier and more affordable four years ago.” He criticized Harris for being ineffective, asking why she hasn’t implemented her proposals during her time in office, and emphasized the need for Republicans to continue highlighting her failures. Pressler also encouraged voters to ensure their voter registration is accurate and to engage with local election boards to prevent any election day issues. He concluded by urging support for his efforts, emphasizing the importance of grassroots action in securing a victory for Trump.  Natalie Winters highlights scenes from the Democratic National Convention, where crowds act radical outside and inside the official gathering.  Mike Benz’s commentary presents a concerning view of the recent developments in Georgia’s election board, framing it within a broader context of potential governmental manipulation and historical parallels. He highlights the involvement of international and domestic intelligence agencies, including DHS and NATO, suggesting that these entities may have played roles in orchestrating events that undermine democratic processes. Benz draws connections between the recent NATO summit and historical instances of false flag operations, particularly a 1962 proposal by U.S. military officials to stage attacks on American soil as a pretext for war with Cuba. He argues that similar tactics might be in play today, with government agencies possibly manipulating events to influence political outcomes. Benz also raises the issue of how specific individuals, like Thomas Crooks, could be manipulated by intelligence agencies to carry out violent acts, which are then used to justify broader government actions. He links these concerns to the handling of the 2020 election and the role of BLM protests, suggesting that these were part of a coordinated effort involving intelligence networks. The commentary paints a picture of a deeply entrenched system where domestic and international intelligence operations intersect, potentially threatening the integrity of democratic processes. Benz warns that these patterns, if left unchecked, could further erode public trust in government institutions.  Allum Bokhari discusses the growing divide within Silicon Valley regarding free speech and censorship. He highlights how some figures, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, have taken a strong stance against censorship, especially in opposition to the U.S. Deep State’s influence on tech companies. However, Bokhari points out that major players like Google and Microsoft remain deeply entrenched in the censorship regime. He notes that these companies have not shifted their policies since the 2020 election and continue to support the censorship complex, as evidenced by their involvement in initiatives like psychological inoculation and media blacklisting through entities like NewsGuard. Bokhari argues that while some parts of Silicon Valley are resisting censorship, the industry as a whole remains divided, with significant portions still aligned with establishment interests.  Mike Lindell meets Harry Sisson at the DNC, and they troll each other. Hilarity ensues.  Mike Lindell joins Rudy Giuliani and Dr. Maria Ryan at the DNC to discuss the state of politics, including what happened at the DNC. Lindell jumps in and out from another location to talk about his appearance at the Democratic convention without his noteworthy mustache.

Natalie Winters talked about her feelings about the Democrat National Convention.  Darren Beattie commented on the Democratic National Convention, noting its lack of substantive content but acknowledging its effectiveness in appealing to average, low-information voters. He argued that the convention “struck all the right notes” with a tone that appeared inviting and well-received by the public. Beattie highlighted that speeches, particularly those by Obama and Kamala Harris, were designed to resonate positively with viewers, focusing on emotional appeal rather than policy depth. Beattie also pointed out the strategic advantage Democrats gained from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s departure from the race and his implied support for Trump. This shift forces anti-woke centrists, who previously saw Kennedy as a viable alternative, to reconsider their position. According to Beattie, this scenario complicates the Democrats’ efforts, creating “a whole other headache” by expanding the battleground to multiple fronts, which could diminish the impact of any short-term boost from the convention.  Josh Hammer talked about his reaction to the Democrat National Convention.  Natalie Winters gave some of her thoughts and ideas about the important activism that is being done by the WarRoom audience for the coming elections, building up to November and beyond.  Natalie Winters analyzed the Democrats’ election strategy for November and how she thinks they will get Democrats elected.  Nataline Winters talked about her analysis of the Democrat’s playbook and predicted that they would accuse Republicans of stealing the election.

Darren Beattie discusses the arrest of Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, highlighting it as a significant development in the ongoing struggle between free speech advocates and state censorship. Beattie argues that Durov’s arrest on charges such as distributing child pornography and drug trafficking is essentially punitive, aimed at pressuring him to comply with state demands for censorship and information. He sees this as part of a broader escalation by states unable to censor platforms traditionally, moving towards criminalizing speech they oppose. Beattie notes that this trend is also reflected in the U.S., citing the felony charge against Douglas Mackey as another example. He emphasizes the geopolitical implications, particularly with Durov’s efforts to maintain a neutral, privacy-focused platform, suggesting that this has drawn ire from multiple intelligence agencies worldwide. Beattie concludes that the arrest marks a dangerous new phase in the global “censorship wars,” with significant consequences for free speech and geopolitical neutrality.  Robert Malone discusses his political journey, stating he has friends across various political camps, including centrist libertarians and those linked to both Trump and Kennedy. Initially involved in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign, Malone distanced himself after disagreeing with some of Kennedy’s policies. Over time, he became convinced that Trump’s positions align more closely with his own views, particularly regarding free speech and the Second Amendment. He supports Trump unequivocally, believing that Trump’s leadership is essential for America’s future. Additionally, Malone criticizes the updated COVID-19 vaccines, citing insufficient data and potential risks like myocarditis. He argues that regulatory processes are being bypassed and emphasizes the importance of scientific rigor. He also mentions his book, which aims to educate readers on media manipulation and technological tactics used against the public, promoting resilience against such strategies.  Mike Benz discussed how the encrypted messaging app Telegram is used by the U.S. government for international diplomacy and covert operations. He highlighted its role in the 2020 Belarus protests, supported by the U.S. State Department and CIA, to evade state surveillance. Benz also mentioned the U.S. interest in using Telegram to support dissidents in Russia, citing U.S. NGOs’ condemnation when Russia considered banning Telegram in 2018. He suggested that the U.S. attempts to gain access to Telegram’s backend, including efforts to recruit Telegram’s chief engineer. Benz believes Telegram is vital for U.S. intelligence, enabling them to gather information and coordinate activities without leaving federal fingerprints. He implied the recent arrest of Telegram’s founder in France may have been coordinated with the U.S. due to its strategic importance, especially for monitoring Russian communications and propaganda.  Natalie Winters talked about the lack of appropriate behavior by the Biden/Harris administration toward the tragic deaths of 13 members in the Afghanistan withdrawal,  representing the disastrous policies in general by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.  In their discussion, Joe Allen and Noor Bin Laden express concerns about the transhumanist movement and its implications for individual freedom, highlighting fears of a “collectivist hive mind.” Noor criticizes Elon Musk’s role in advancing technological convergence and his influence on social media, suggesting platforms like X are tools for psychological manipulation. The conversation shifts to a recent World Economic Forum report identifying four global risks in the post-pandemic era: a decline in American dominance, political legitimacy crises, an international mental health crisis, and potential cyber threats. Noor argues that these risks are part of a broader agenda for global control, emphasizing the need for vigilance against misinformation and manipulation. Joe concludes by advising resistance to fear and compliance, urging people to stay informed and retain their humanity amidst these challenges.   In a conversation with Joe Allen, Tim Hinchcliffe discussed a declassified document from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The document reveals that the intelligence community seeks cost-effective methods to acquire publicly and commercially available data, bypassing traditional legal constraints like obtaining warrants. Hinchcliffe explained that this practice, normalized over time, allows government and private entities to access and use personal data extensively. He highlighted how smartphones and other digital devices make tracking individuals easier, which raises privacy concerns. Hinchcliffe’s article on this topic, titled “The U.S. Spy Community is Looking for Cheaper, Quicker Ways to Access and Buy Your Data,” is available on his website, Sociable.co. The discussion emphasizes the increasing ease with which personal information is collected and the importance of awareness and potential resistance to such data practices.

Michael Knowles criticizes Democratic policies, particularly those of Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, regarding transgender issues and education. Knowles argues that Walz’s actions, like promoting tampons in boys’ bathrooms and making Minnesota a sanctuary for trans kids, are abnormal and push inappropriate sexual topics onto children. He contrasts this with Republican values, highlighting that while Democrats are accused of wanting to ban books like the Bible, Republicans aim to remove explicit material from schools. Knowles also comments on political censorship and media bias, noting how social media platforms were pressured to suppress conservative voices and stories like Hunter Biden’s laptop. Additionally, he critiques Kamala Harris for changing debate rules to favor herself, portraying her actions as manipulative. Overall, Knowles positions himself and conservatives as defenders of traditional values against what he sees as the extreme and hypocritical policies of the left.  Mike Davis argues that the legal actions against former President Trump, led by special counsel Jack Smith, are politically motivated attempts to interfere in the upcoming 2024 election. He compares Trump’s repeated legal battles to a "Freddy Krueger” scenario, where Trump keeps coming back despite continuous attacks. Davis criticizes the use of obstruction charges, which he claims were previously deemed inappropriate by the Supreme Court. He suggests that Smith’s strategy is to push for a quick ruling on presidential immunity, aiming to damage Trump’s election campaign. Davis also accuses the Biden administration of allowing China to exploit trade agreements, hurting American manufacturing and jobs. He expresses concerns about the lack of action against Chinese economic practices and believes that, if elected, Trump would implement strong trade policies to protect American industries and national security.  Natalie Winters shared the reasoning for her “loom and doom” over the future and her deep dislike of Republicans. She also talked about her negativity toward Republicans being in government. Part One:  Part Two:  Joanna Miller discusses the economic downturn, highlighting significant issues in the agriculture sector, such as the closure of Tyson Foods’ largest poultry processing facility in Virginia, which resulted in 700 layoffs. She notes that agricultural production, particularly in pork, is declining, reflecting a broader recession marked by decreased economic activity. Miller criticizes Kamala Harris for failing to support American industries, contrasting her with Donald Trump, whom she credits with revitalizing the industrial base through tariffs and promoting domestic investment in manufacturing, including steel production. She emphasizes that Trump’s policies helped prevent inflation and created jobs, asserting that if Trump is re-elected, he will restore these industries. Miller believes Trump’s leadership understands the importance of a robust industrial base for economic and national security and vows to reverse the trend of companies moving abroad by reinforcing the American manufacturing sector.  Jeff Clark discusses a new indictment against former President Trump, suggesting it is part of ongoing efforts to pursue Trump legally. He mentions that a new grand jury was used for this indictment, possibly to avoid issues with previous evidence that could violate a July 1st decision regarding Trump’s immunity and evidence exclusion rules. This new approach likely ensures any previously excluded evidence does not compromise the indictment. Clark implies that these legal actions are part of a broader strategy to interfere with the upcoming election, noting that the indictment’s timing coincides with the peak of the campaign season and an upcoming debate. He describes the indictment as a modified version of earlier charges, possibly adjusted to avoid legal challenges related to immunity and exclusionary rules that protect actions within the executive branch.  Terry Schilling, President of the American Principles Project, discusses their upcoming summit in Washington, D.C., with Tiffany Justice, President of Moms for Liberty, featuring notable speakers like Rob Schneider and Seth Dillon. The conversation highlights the importance of taking action instead of spreading negativity online. Tiffany introduces a panel of influential speakers, including Tulsi Gabbard and Jennifer Sey, who advocate for children’s rights and against controversial educational policies. They discuss the political landscape, emphasizing the fractures within the Democratic Party over issues like gender transition surgeries and children’s rights. Paula Scanlan, a former college swimmer, shares her experience of being forced to undress in front of a transgender teammate, describing the coercion and lack of support from authorities. The conversation critiques policies allowing men in women’s spaces, arguing that they endanger women and girls and undermine common-sense protections for vulnerable populations. Part One:  In this conversation, participants discussed various political and cultural issues, particularly focusing on President Trump’s leadership style, the influence of RFK Jr., and the pro-life movement. They expressed optimism that Trump’s decision-making process, which involves diverse perspectives, offers hope for reversing current challenges in America. The conversation highlighted the importance of uniting a broad coalition, including disillusioned Democrats, to address issues like abortion, free speech, and gender policies. They also emphasized the need for strategic, culturally aware political actions that align with the public’s sentiments on sensitive topics, like abortion, to achieve long-term goals.

Darren Beattie discusses the intricate dynamics of geopolitics and censorship, highlighting a recent Revolver News piece exploring these complexities. He critiques the Atlantic Council’s DFR Lab as a censorship tool for the U.S. security establishment, accusing it of weaponizing disinformation to justify censorship. Beattie notes its funding from U.S. and British governments and a Ukrainian oligarch, linking its activities to the U.S. government’s interests, especially in relation to Ukraine. He suggests that Telegram is targeted by the Atlantic Council due to its role in disseminating uncensored information from conflict zones like Ukraine. Beattie also touches on a broader shift among tech elites, with figures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg aligning with MAGA, driven by both conviction and a need to protect business interests in a polarized environment. He argues that neutrality in the current geopolitical climate is increasingly difficult, as exemplified by Telegram’s Durov.  Mike Howell criticizes the handling of investigations by special counsels, particularly focusing on the disparity between the treatment of Donald Trump and Joe and Hunter Biden. He argues that the investigation into Trump, led by Jack Smith, has been excessive and politically motivated, with expenditures significantly higher than those for the Biden investigations. Howell contends that Trump’s case is straightforward, as he had the authority to declassify documents, unlike the Bidens, whose actions with classified materials span decades and involve corrupt interests. He criticizes special counsel Robert Hur’s investigation into Joe Biden as inadequate, merely cataloging the locations of documents rather than probing potential misuse for personal gain. Howell sees this as an example of election interference and a biased judicial process. Additionally, he highlights efforts by the left to manipulate the electoral process, contrasting them with the right’s reaction to Biden’s campaign strategies and the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) handling of nominations.  Natalie Winters talked about her general dislike of Republicans and her anger toward them as a group. She questioned why they waited for Subpoena Judge Merchan’s daughter to investigate her financial ties to charges and cases brought against President Trump.  Phillip Patrick critiques a proposed economic policy involving price controls and tax credits, arguing that these measures will have negative long-term effects. He points out that the administration’s proposed tax credits—$6,000 for newborns and $3,600 for existing children—are not feasible because the federal government lacks the funds to support them. Implementing these policies could devalue the dollar and increase inflation. Patrick suggests that, although such measures might be worth debating if the government had the necessary resources, they are currently unrealistic and would likely exacerbate economic problems rather than resolve them.   Dr. Allen Mendenhall discusses the economic principle of supply and demand, particularly in the context of natural disasters in Alabama, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. He explains that higher prices during shortages signal suppliers to increase production or reallocate resources, helping to alleviate the shortage. Mendenhall emphasizes that increasing prices prevents resources from being depleted by ensuring they are allocated to those who need them most rather than those who value them less. He argues this mechanism is crucial, especially when essential services like ambulances need fuel. Mendenhall warns against setting price controls, stating that they can be counterproductive by disincentivizing new market entrants and innovations, ultimately keeping prices high. He critiques Kamala Harris’s economic platform for including price controls, suggesting that such policies misunderstand basic financial principles and can adversely affect supply and demand.  In a discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and U.S. Representative Tim Burchett (R-TN), concerns were raised about Democratic Vice Presidential pick Tim Waltz’s extensive connections to China. Burchett criticized Waltz’s frequent travels to China, citing over 30 visits since 1989 and suggesting potential undue influence from the Chinese Communist Party. He emphasized the need for transparency, stating, “Anyone who’s gone to China 30 times…wouldn’t be coming back if he at least didn’t get the approval of the Chinese Communist Party.” Burchett also voiced worries about the media’s lack of scrutiny on Waltz and potential threats to U.S. security, hinting at a broader conspiracy involving U.S. institutions. He stressed the importance of public vigilance, civility and action to prevent the perceived erosion of American values and sovereignty.  Dr. Derrek Harvey, Dr. Bradley Thayer, and Retired Captain James Farnell examined strategic developments in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. Harvey highlighted Iran’s continued aggression against Israel, facilitated by proxies like Hezbollah, aiming to wear down Israel’s economy and isolate it internationally. He criticized the U.S. administration for its perceived lack of support for Israel and leniency towards Iran, which he argues emboldens Iran’s efforts. Farnell then shifted the focus to the Indo-Pacific, noting the absence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the region for the first time in over two decades, as China aggressively challenges U.S. allies, including the Philippines and Japan. He expressed concern over the U.S. response, describing it as a signal of diminishing American commitment in the region, which could encourage further Chinese assertiveness. Both experts emphasized the need for stronger U.S. actions to uphold its commitments and deter adversaries in these critical regions. Part One:  Part Two:

In her recent discussion, Cortney Turner highlighted key insights from her interview with Richard Poe and emphasized the enduring influence of the Fabian Society. Turner noted that the Fabian Society, founded in 1884, epitomizes dialectical warfare tactics. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolizes their incremental approach to subversion—gradually infiltrating and altering societies without direct confrontation. Turner explained that the Fabians’ tactics align with the dialectical tensions currently shaping political and social unrest. She pointed out that the Fabian Society, through its incremental strategy, has played a central role in creating and perpetuating these tensions. This approach, rooted in the ideas of gradual change rather than abrupt revolution, reflects in contemporary issues including educational subversion and cultural shifts. Turner also linked these tactics to broader conspiracies involving organizations like Lucis Trust and the Theosophical Society, illustrating a convergence of political and spiritual agendas aimed at societal manipulation. She urged listeners to understand these dynamics as part of a long-standing strategy of cultural and political subversion, encapsulated in her upcoming Cognitive Liberty Conference. In a recent analysis, Darren Beattie criticized the selection of Tim Walz as Vice President for Kamala Harris, suggesting it marks the end of Harris’s brief popularity surge. Beattie noted, “We had Peak Kamala,” and criticized her for bypassing other potential candidates like the astronaut from Arizona and Josh Shapiro. He argued that choosing Shapiro might have strategically benefited Harris by showing a less radical image to mainstream voters. Instead, he describes Walz as the "George Floyd riot guy,” pointing to his involvement in controversial issues like redefining pedophilia as a sexual orientation and promoting tampons in boys’ bathrooms. Beattie claims this choice reflects poorly on Harris’s decision-making and highlights her vulnerability to far-left pressures. He further comments on Boeing’s failures, emphasizing a broader decline in competency within U.S. institutions, notably the space program, contrasting it with past achievements.  Peter Bergegger argues that election practices favoring Democrats amount to “legalized fraud.” He criticizes the “Zucker Buck” approach, where Democrats target specific areas through nonprofit organizations, often tax-exempt, to boost voter turnout. He accuses these groups of bribing voters, particularly through initiatives led by Michelle Obama, like “Party at the Polls” and “Pizza to the Polls,” where food and entertainment are provided to encourage voting. Bergegger claims, "You cannot give even one single dollar of any type of incentive,” suggesting these practices violate federal law. He notes that lawsuits have been filed against Michelle Obama, accusing her of orchestrating voter bribery, with operations across 516 U.S. locations. Additionally, Bergegger highlights how organizations like ActBlue allegedly use “smurfing” to launder large donations into small contributions, thus circumventing campaign finance laws. He describes this as using elderly citizens’ information to funnel money through bots, claiming, "The bad guys are doing it through the box system of ActBlue.” Bergegger also criticizes the Republican National Committee for failing to address these issues, stating their primary goal is fundraising rather than winning elections. His investigations have led to complaints against various political figures, emphasizing the scale of alleged fraud.  Natalie Winters commented on the administrative state and how members who are supporting Kamala Harris, as Republicans, admit to favoring their job with the establishment over the mandate given to President Trump by the voters for America First policies.  Winters reacted to a cold open from MSNBC.  Natalie talked about her discovery that MN Governor Tim Wallz, the VP pick to run with Kamala Harris, is tied to a group that she says has ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  Josh Hammer, in his podcast “America on Trial with Josh Hammer,” delves into the recent antitrust ruling against Google, which he views as a landmark moment. The case, initiated during the Trump administration and continued under Biden, saw Google being scrutinized for its monopolistic practices. Hammer highlights that the ruling, issued by Judge Mehta, determined Google’s search and advertising functions constitute illegal monopolies under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. He notes, “This is the federal government’s first major win in an antitrust case in literally 20 to 25 years,” underscoring its significance. Hammer appreciates the bipartisan effort behind the case, noting the unusual continuation of the lawsuit across different administrations. He emphasizes the case’s impact on American public consciousness and the potential for major changes in how Google operates. While the specific remedies are still undecided, Hammer is optimistic about the potential for significant reforms. He also reflects on the broader implications for tech giants and public sovereignty, suggesting that the case might open the door for new players to challenge established tech monopolies.  Recent violence in the UK, sparked by the murder of three young girls, has led to significant social upheaval. The attacker, initially misidentified as an immigrant, was later revealed to be a UK-born individual of Rwandan descent. This revelation intensified tensions and ignited widespread riots across the country. Rick Munn, reporting from Ireland, highlighted the chaos following the incident. "The violence was ignited after a vigil for the victims turned chaotic, with reports of escalating unrest across the UK.” Munn emphasized the critical role of misinformation and its impact on public sentiment. The British government has responded with a robust crackdown. Munn reported on recent measures: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed clear support for the police, promising increased security and criminal justice efforts.” Munn also noted that there is a strong emphasis on addressing violence both online and offline, with early arrests and swift legal action. However, Munn raised concerns about potential biases in the justice system. He remarked, "The contrast in how the justice system handles different groups is evident. There’s criticism over perceived ‘two-tier’ policing, where some groups face more severe scrutiny than others.” The situation remains tense, with ongoing debates about immigration policies and community integration adding to the volatility. Munn observed, "In both Ireland and the UK, local communities are feeling the strain of increased migrant populations without adequate support or consultation.”  Noor Bin Ladin provided a critical analysis of the ongoing riots in Europe, particularly focusing on the UK. She described the current unrest as part of a long-standing strategy involving “divide and rule” and “problem, reaction, solution.” Bin Ladin argued that these tactics, which have historical roots going back over 200 years, are designed to manipulate societies by creating chaos and then exploiting it to implement pre-determined solutions. According to Bin Ladin, the turmoil is not an organic outcome of mass immigration but a deliberate strategy that has culminated from past destabilizations, particularly the Middle Eastern conflicts. She linked the current European unrest to the actions of past leaders like Obama and Blair, suggesting their policies led to the “floodgates” of migration into Europe, intensifying ethnic tensions. Bin Ladin criticized the response to the riots, noting a trend towards increasing surveillance and restrictions on freedoms. She explained, “They are using something called the strategy of tension by pitting these different groups together… The solutions inevitably lead to a loss of freedoms for the local population.” She emphasized that these measures, including enhanced surveillance and digital IDs, are aimed at controlling and monitoring the population, while the underlying issues and perpetrators of the violence are inadequately addressed.  In her recent discussion, Cortney Turner highlighted key insights from her interview with Richard Poe and emphasized the enduring influence of the Fabian Society. Turner noted that the Fabian Society, founded in 1884, epitomizes dialectical warfare tactics. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolizes their incremental approach to subversion—gradually infiltrating and altering societies without direct confrontation. Turner explained that the Fabians’ tactics align with the dialectical tensions currently shaping political and social unrest. She pointed out that the Fabian Society, through its incremental strategy, has played a central role in creating and perpetuating these tensions. This approach, rooted in the ideas of gradual change rather than abrupt revolution, reflects in contemporary issues including educational subversion and cultural shifts. Turner also linked these tactics to broader conspiracies involving organizations like Lucis Trust and the Theosophical Society, illustrating a convergence of political and spiritual agendas aimed at societal manipulation. She urged listeners to understand these dynamics as part of a long-standing strategy of cultural and political subversion, encapsulated in her upcoming Cognitive Liberty Conference.

Logan Washburn of The Federalist discussed concerns about election misinformation efforts in Michigan, drawing parallels to the 2020 election. He noted that the Center for Tech and Civic Life, linked to Zuckerberg, continues influencing elections, including the 2024 one. In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages citizens to report neighbors for spreading “misinformation,” sparking controversy. The state has established a government email for such reports and launched the “Democracy Ambassadors Program,” ironically promoting neighbor snitching for misinformation in democracy’s name. This approach raises concerns about governmental overreach, potentially suppressing speech by labeling it misinformation. Washburn highlights Attorney General Dana Nessel’s letters threatening legal action against individuals sharing supposed misinformation. One recipient, Carolyn Elic, criticized polling location changes on Facebook and received a legal threat, showcasing the seriousness of these measures. This reflects a broader national trend of combating misinformation, raising questions about free speech and political discourse.  Parker Thayer from Capital Research Center discusses the complex web of dark money influencing left-wing judicial advocacy and political maneuvers. According to Thayer, Demand Justice, a 501(c)(4) dark money group, played a significant role in turning the Supreme Court nomination processes into media circuses, such as during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Thayer states, “Simply because the court has started making rulings that the left does not like, they’re reaching for any weapon they can to attack the Supreme Court.” Demand Justice, originally a project of the 1630 Fund, is linked to Arabella Advisors, a large network directing over a billion dollars annually to leftist causes. Thayer points out the influence of Brian Fallon, former communications director for several high-profile Democrats, who founded Demand Justice and now leads Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. The narrative suggests a strategic manipulation of campaign finance laws, contrasting this with conservative efforts to protect the Supreme Court. While acknowledging some conservative judicial advocacy, Thayer emphasizes the need for continued vigilance against what he perceives as existential threats to the judiciary.  Natalie Winters reacted to a corporate media segment praising Kamala Harris as a Black female boss.  Author Trevor Loudon talked about his past research into the Communist ties of both Kamala Harris and Trevor Loudon.  Mike Lindell talked about his experiences with Democrat Tim Walz. He gave his opinion that Kamala Harris’s choice of him will help President Trump because he is so radical with his policy moves in Minnesota.  Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote praised a recent Georgia election board meeting as a significant step forward for election integrity. Engelbrecht highlighted the bipartisan participation in the meeting, where Republicans and Democrats stood together to address election process concerns. She emphasized the importance of new measures allowing access to ballot images, enabling poll watchers at tabulation centers, and providing election officials with necessary support to ensure transparency. Engelbrecht noted that the citizens of Georgia have been instrumental in pushing for these changes and expressed hope that other states would follow suit. True the Vote is actively working on various initiatives, including verifying voter roll accuracy and conducting voter outreach in long-term care facilities. They aim to engage volunteers nationwide to assist in voter registration and education efforts. Engelbrecht encourages people to get involved through their website, truethevote.org, and participate in training programs to support fair and secure elections.  Liz Harrington emphasized the significance of Georgia’s state election board meeting, where a rule was passed allowing county officials to make reasonable inquiries into election results before certifying them. Despite opposition, this rule prevents undue pressure on officials to certify results without verification. Harrington stressed the need for support from Republican parties for election integrity and accountability.  Maureen Bannon criticized Kamala Harris’s choice of Tim Walz as a VP pick, highlighting Walz’s alleged misconduct. She claimed Walz avoided deployment to Iraq in 2005 by retiring early, leaving his Minnesota National Guard unit without leadership. Bannon also accused Walz of exaggerating his military service, stating he falsely claimed 25 years of service and a higher rank. She argued that his willingness to lie about his service raises questions about his honesty with the American people. Bannon suggested this choice reflects poorly on Democratic strategy, asserting that the MAGA movement should continue to highlight such issues.  Terry Shilling, President of the American Principles Project, criticized Tim Walz for his policies on gender transition for minors, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and abortion. Shilling claims Walz supports radical “child mutilation policies,” allowing minors to undergo “chemical castration” and surgeries for gender transitions. According to Shilling, Walz’s policies enable Minnesota to become a sanctuary for minors seeking gender-affirming care, potentially overriding parental authority. Shilling argues that Walz’s stance on DEI promotes “socialism” and undermines merit-based equality. He criticized Walz’s first executive order as governor to establish a DEI Council, calling it Marxism in disguise. Shilling also targeted Walz’s stance on abortion, alleging that Walz’s legislation allows for abortions up to birth and denying care for babies born during failed abortions. Shilling warns, “If Tim Walz and Kamala Harris become president and vice president, you can expect this not just to stay in the blue states… we will have this going all across the country.”  In discussing his new film, Matthew Taylor highlights its impact by delving into “a very large space of time,” exposing the actions of various political villains, including the intelligence community’s alarming involvement in surveillance activities. Taylor expresses his shock over how “the intelligence apparatus…did the work on behalf of the Clinton campaign,” revealing dangerous misuse of power. Despite these serious revelations, Taylor believes the film offers hope by showing that “they got caught” and were defeated by figures like Kash Patel, emphasizing that government corruption can be overcome. Taylor concludes, “These are very dangerous organizations that have unlimited power…but they can be stopped.” The film is available at warroom.film.

Natalie Winters, Brian Kennedy and Michael Anton discussed critical concerns regarding the integrity of upcoming elections and the broader implications of political and administrative actions. The conversation began with a focus on the weaponization of government and the risks associated with election administration, particularly the potential for interference by foreign entities such as Communist China. Brian Kennedy, a prominent figure from the Committee on the Present Danger: China, expressed his deep concerns about the possibility of election manipulation through mail-in ballots. He argued that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was leveraged to push for mail-in voting, which he believes was a key factor in the alleged electoral theft. Kennedy speculated that Communist China, with its significant intelligence and financial resources, could exploit vulnerabilities in the electoral system by producing fraudulent ballots. He emphasized that the Trump campaign would need an overwhelming number of votes to counteract potential fraud and secure a win in 2024, given the inadequate safeguards against such interference. Michael Anton, a former National Security Council advisor and a member of the Claremont Institute’s faculty, discussed the broader implications of administrative failures and potential malfeasance. He argued that the lax approach to election security and voter verification laws might be a deliberate strategy rather than mere incompetence. Anton suggested that by creating a lax environment for voting, the administration ensures that election fraud becomes easier to execute, with local party figures contributing to the outcome without a centralized directive. He also highlighted the role of the Transition Integrity Project, which, according to him, planned to challenge the legitimacy of a Trump victory through various means, including media manipulation and legal tactics. The conversation also touched on the potentially radical implications of the Biden administration’s policies, with Anton criticizing Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential pick as a signal of confidence in the current system’s ability to secure an advantageous outcome for Democrats, regardless of the public or political response. Both Kennedy and Anton urged their audience to remain vigilant and proactive, emphasizing the importance of grassroots efforts, such as whistleblower programs and increased scrutiny, to prevent election fraud and ensure fair voting processes. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  In a discussion hosted by Lara Logan, filling in for Steve Bannon, Dr. Keith Rose provided insights into the geopolitical developments in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal. Logan emphasized the importance of the First Amendment and highlighted the lack of media coverage on Steve Bannon’s imprisonment. Dr. Rose, with extensive experience in U.S. intelligence, shared significant revelations about Afghanistan, particularly concerning a meeting that occurred a year before the U.S. pullout. This meeting included Chinese military, diplomatic, and intelligence officials with the Afghan Ministry of Defense. Rose disclosed another pivotal meeting shortly before the U.S. withdrawal, involving high-ranking individuals such as CIA Director Burns, Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, Chinese intelligence officials, Iranian Republican Guard Corps, and Pakistani representatives. Rose questioned the presence of these individuals, especially since Haqqani had a bounty on his head and a history of violence against Americans. He noted the peculiar security arrangements, including the use of a tier-one group rather than CIA personnel, and the opaque nature of these discussions. Dr. Rose highlighted the consequences of these meetings in the current geopolitical landscape, stating, “The Afghans have the ability through their passport office to create biometric passports and when people come to Afghanistan to train, they will then kid documentation that will allow them to travel.” He warned that the collaboration between the Taliban and China has led to significant Chinese influence in Afghanistan, affecting military, security, and intelligence sectors. This partnership is a concern for U.S. security, especially with the Taliban reportedly training thousands of jihadis and the potential for these individuals to infiltrate the U.S. through established networks. The discussion underscored the strategic expansion of China in Afghanistan and its implications for U.S. national security and global influence.   Ammon Blair, a former intelligence analyst and Texas Public Policy Foundation fellow, has raised alarms about the escalating relationship between Venezuelan cartels and the Chinese government. According to Blair, this collaboration poses a substantial threat to U.S. national security and has exploited weaknesses in the current administration’s border policies. Blair traces the origins of this alliance back to Hugo Chavez’s strategic partnership with Iran and Cuba in the late 1990s. This network has since expanded to include Russia and China, making Venezuela a central hub in a broader asymmetrical warfare strategy against the United States. “If Americans think that…our adversaries have been sitting back just…allowing America to destroy itself, they haven’t been capitalizing on it,” Blair asserted, emphasizing that this is a coordinated effort involving several hostile parties. The numbers reveal a troubling trend. In 2017, there were only 2,600 Venezuelan apprehensions at the U.S. border. By 2023, that number surged to 334,000, indicating a dramatic increase in migration due to Venezuela’s internal collapse under Maduro’s regime. While many Venezuelans are fleeing genuine crises, Blair warns that the Venezuelan government has deliberately emptied prisons, releasing criminal elements to infiltrate the United States. Blair explained how these released individuals form a transnational criminal organization, benefiting from U.S. policies on open borders. He described it as “political theater” by the Venezuelan government, as they position cartel leaders for global influence rather than meaningful reform. “The Mexican cartel has really already built a Silk Road for them,” Blair noted, highlighting how this infrastructure is used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to support their operations in the United States. The link between Venezuelan and Mexican cartels, especially the violent CJNG cartel, creates a direct threat to American communities, contributing to increased violence in cities like New York, Chicago, and Dallas. This collaboration has essentially created a conduit for the CCP’s interests, using Mexican cartels as proxies in their broader strategy of unrestricted warfare against the U.S. “The Chinese have weaponized Mexican cartels and used them as proxies in their unrestricted warfare on the United States,” Blair stated, underscoring the critical nature of this alliance. The implications are far-reaching, affecting not only border security but also the fabric of American society. Blair’s analysis calls for urgent attention and action, as these threats are no longer confined to the borders but have penetrated into everyday American life. His insights reveal a complex web of geopolitical alliances that demand a strategic and robust response from U.S. policymakers.  George Pond, a policy expert and Texas native, discussed the pressing issue of the Chinese-Mexican cartel alliance and its implications for U.S. security. Pond highlighted the fictional novel “Cartel Wars” by Dr. Richard Funk, which explores this dangerous collaboration. The novel envisions a scenario where Mexican cartels, supported by China, invade the U.S., with the narrative focusing on an invasion of Texas and its impact on American resilience. Pond emphasized that the book reflects real concerns about border security and geopolitical threats. He noted, “The book captures the essence of what could happen if we remain complacent about the growing threat from these alliances.” He connected the fictional narrative to recent events, drawing parallels with global conflicts and the vulnerabilities exposed by America’s open border policies. Pond’s discussion underscores the urgent need to address these emerging threats. He warned of a broader strategic challenge, stating, “We have been under an invasion for a long time,” referring to the ongoing impacts of drug warfare, human smuggling, and threats to critical infrastructure. His remarks suggest that understanding and addressing these risks are crucial for safeguarding national security and preparing for potential future conflicts.

Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec discussed the evolving political landscape, focusing on President Trump’s strategic approach to maneuver warfare. Bannon emphasized how the Trump administration’s rapid and aggressive political tactics, such as targeting entities like USAID and dismantling the institutional framework that perpetuates establishment power, are central to reclaiming control from those who do not prioritize patriotism. They criticized the current political elite, noting their lack of resilience and inability to adapt to the new normal of fast-paced, disruptive politics.
Bannon also highlighted the corrupt practices within the U.S. military-industrial complex, pointing to wasteful spending on defense projects like the F-35 and the LCS program. He argued that these failures represent a broader issue of inefficiency within the government, driven by misplaced priorities like diversity quotas instead of excellence.
The conversation turned to the importance of perseverance, with Bannon stressing that the key to defeating the opposition lies in maintaining momentum and consistently challenging the status quo. Posobiec underscored the need to treat the political opposition as hostile, reflecting a hostile government takeover by those who love the country. They concluded by calling for relentless action to reform and reclaim American institutions.
In a recent discussion between Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, the conversation focused heavily on the role of Tom Homan, the former acting director of ICE, in the ongoing immigration crisis and efforts to manage illegal immigration. Homan’s strategy is central to Trump’s plans to curb illegal immigration, with a particular focus on deportations.
Winters criticized the resistance from groups like the ACLU, claiming their efforts to sabotage ICE raids are detrimental to the government’s mission. “These left-wing groups, particularly the ACLU, are actively working to undermine ICE’s ability to do their job,” Bannon stated, highlighting their campaigns that encourage immigrants, including criminals, to avoid cooperating with authorities.
Winters shared insights on Homan’s challenges in handling raids and deportations, mentioning that the White House is pushing for larger-scale actions. “They’re facing logistical issues with detention facilities and lack of resources,” Winters explained, pointing out that Homan is under pressure to meet more considerable deportation expectations. The White House is seeking “bigger numbers, faster” to ramp up enforcement significantly.
Homan’s efforts are critical to Trump’s immigration policies, but as Bannon noted, resistance from both the media and political circles remains a significant obstacle. Despite these challenges, Homan’s leadership continues to be a key component of the administration’s approach to border security.
In a candid discussion on WarRoom, Harvard Law student Kimo Gandall, a third-year student (3L), shared insights into his experiences at the prestigious institution. He expressed his belief that Harvard’s rigorous “paper chase” system, akin to military boot camp, was designed to toughen students and build them back up. Gandall, openly conservative and a supporter of MAGA principles, emphasized the importance of strong, explicit opinions, contrasting them with what he described as the “spiritually weak” left, which lacks direction and often turns to existentialism or pseudo-religious ideologies.
He also critiqued the growing influence of artificial intelligence, noting how companies controlling large language models, like OpenAI, are against natural law and actively censor conservative views. Gandall warned that transhumanism, as part of postmodern Western ideals, represents an attempt to “reconstruct God’s world,” driven by pride.
Addressing legal debates, Gandall reflected on the slow pace of the judicial process, attributing it to intellectual elitism and pride. He encouraged open, honest discourse despite ideological divides, suggesting that respectful conversations can change opinions. He also shared his views on social media and artificial intelligence, stating he posts regularly about the conservative movement and AI.
Part One:
In this discussion between Harvard Professor Amy Wax and Steve Bannon, Wax criticizes the current state of academia, particularly at elite institutions like Harvard, for neglecting its duty to preserve and pass on the foundational values of Western Civilization. She laments the shift in academic attitudes, where institutions once rooted in historical sacrifice and achievement are now being debased, with an increasing focus on identity politics, diversity, and the rejection of meritocracy.
Wax points out the hypocrisy of elites who advocate for equality while exempting themselves from its implications, creating a divide between them and ordinary people. She argues that universities have become strongholds for far-left ideologies, which often promote self-fashioning and the pursuit of equality of outcome, as exemplified by the rise of woke culture.
In her advice to President Trump, Wax suggests defunding these institutions, particularly those that violate civil rights laws, as a way to force them to refocus on Western Civilization and restore their integrity. Wax believes that cutting off federal funding would compel universities to prove their worth and adherence to the law.
In a discussion with Steve Bannon, Harvard law student Sam Delmar shared his experiences as a conservative at the prestigious institution, shedding light on the challenges of maintaining religious and political beliefs in an increasingly liberal academic environment. During his first week at Harvard Law, Delmar recalls how simply expressing his faith caused two-thirds of his classmates to avoid him. He describes the atmosphere as one where conservatives are marginalized, and even his devout practice of praying daily led to being labeled a "religious bigot.”
Despite these challenges, Delmar highlights a silver lining: forming a strong, tight-knit conservative community within the law school. He criticizes what he calls the "milk toast” conservatives—students who claim to support originalism but vote for figures like Kamala Harris, demonstrating a lack of absolute political conviction. Delmar notes the issue of careerism in law school, where many students prioritize their professional futures over ideological consistency, fearing the consequences of deviating from the left-wing norm. He argues that the conservative movement needs to exclude these opportunistic figures to maintain integrity.
Delmar also shares insights about his background, mentioning his time at Notre Dame, which has shifted from its Catholic roots toward progressive ideals. He believes that growing support for MAGA among younger generations signals a shift, even within elite institutions like Harvard.
In this conversation between Ambassador Carla Sands and Steve Bannon, they discuss several key issues, primarily focusing on America First policies, institutional reform, and national security. Sands emphasizes the need for a revolution that will change the nation’s approach to higher education funding, particularly targeting Ivy League institutions like Harvard and Penn that receive large amounts of federal money. She and Bannon agree that Title VI should be used to hold these universities accountable for how they manage these funds.
They also discuss the decision to shut down USAID, which Sands describes as a “piggy bank” for funding ideologies pushed by entities like the Clintons and NGOs. She supports the idea of redirecting resources to benefit American taxpayers and national interests, particularly in foreign policy and trade relations, where countries rejected the U.S. due to the imposition of foreign ideologies.
The conversation shifts to the excitement of political action under the current administration, with Sands describing the rapid pace of executive actions and orders. She also highlights the challenge posed by media resistance and the courts but expresses optimism about pushing forward with policies, emphasizing the importance of judges not obstructing the president’s agenda.
On the topic of Greenland and Arctic strategy, Sands shares her insights as a former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark, explaining the strategic significance of Greenland in relation to national security, particularly its proximity to Russia and its role in controlling vital sea lanes. Sands describes the tense geopolitical competition in the Arctic, with Russia militarizing the region and China seeking influence through its Polar Silk Road initiative. She notes the potential for a strategic relationship with Greenland, which is seeking independence from Denmark due to its financial struggles and lack of development. Sands reflects on her efforts to support Greenland’s development and its desire for help in mining and other industries, while rejecting Chinese influence.
The conversation concludes with Sands expressing her eagerness to continue serving under President Trump in any capacity, whether as an ambassador or special envoy, due to the excitement and significance of the current political moment. She also shares her social media handles for those interested in following her work.

In a War Room segment, John Mills warns of escalating tensions as Ukraine employs advanced missiles like the JASSM via F-16s, potentially provoking a severe Russian response. He calls this move “incredibly provocative” and cautions against further escalation. Mills also critiques the Biden administration’s approach to global conflicts, describing it as “provocative at the wrong time.” He points out that while Ukraine’s military maneuvers may be driven by fears of a Trump victory, the U.S. is acting from a “position of weakness.” Mills links economic struggles to geopolitical tensions, noting that the U.S. and China are engaged in “asymmetric warfare” targeting each other’s systems. He expresses concern over U.S. elites, including both Democrats and Republicans, being “captured” by Chinese influence, undermining America’s defense and fiscal stability. Mills emphasizes the need for the U.S. to act with “resolve, clarity, and strength” to protect the constitutional republic. Natalie Winter explains that based on her 2022 article, George Soros and China are funding election oversight groups in 2024.  Mike Howell discusses his ongoing investigations into illegal alien voting in swing states, highlighting issues similar to those found in North Carolina and Georgia. He states, “it’s like shooting fish in a barrel” due to how easy it is to find non-citizens registered to vote. Howell argues that illegal voter registration is a significant problem, despite media misinformation, and claims the U.S. is “in huge trouble” as the country faces an invasion. He also criticizes U.S. funding for UK disinformation studies, calling for the House Appropriations Committee to cut budgets for foreign censorship collaborations targeting free speech online.  Natalie Winters explains “RINOS” as Republicans who want to control the Republican Party for themselves and says they are not interested in Trump’s victory.  Mike Ben explains his use of “The Bob” to describe the intelligence agencies that appear to work against the American people in elections. He includes operations in the United Kingdom, which he claims are coordinated with American counterparts to impact elections and candidates.  Natalie Winters explains that the Department of Justice has been weaponized against Steve Bannon and he has been imprisoned to keep him quiet.  Ben Bergquam strongly criticizes the Biden administration, particularly Kamala Harris, for the failure to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, leading to severe humanitarian and security crises. He highlights the tragic issue of missing children, stating, “Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of different nature.” According to Bergquam, the incomplete border wall east of Nogales, Arizona, is now controlled by cartels, and the lack of border patrol agents in the area underscores the severity of the situation. He points out that the cartels have operational control, with lookout points, armed men, and even solar panels to facilitate illegal crossings and drug smuggling. Bergquam specifically blames Kamala Harris and Joe Biden for this failure, asserting that their refusal to complete the wall has left the border wide open, allowing cartels to profit while American citizens suffer. “The reason this section of wall is not complete is because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didn’t want it built,” he claims. He adds that the Democratic Party’s opposition to border security is not just policy-based but ideological, accusing them of chanting “no borders, no walls, no USA at all.” He connects this failure to broader issues, such as the rise in fentanyl deaths and violence caused by illegal aliens, and asserts that both Harris and Biden have turned a blind eye to the crisis. “If Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in any of these Democrats actually cared about kids, they would be talking about it. They would be undoing their policies that have invited this,” Bergquam argues, highlighting their lack of response to the ongoing tragedy. Bergquam also recounts his own experience witnessing cartel activity at the border, describing cartel bunkers and drug mules preparing to cross into the U.S., which only stopped when he was present. He warns that if the current administration and their policies remain in place, “we’re screwed as a country,” but expresses hope that the American people are waking up to the situation and will take action in the next election. His closing message is a call for unity in defending the values that make America great.  Sabin Howard, a renowned sculptor, reflects on his nine-year journey creating the National World War I Memorial, “A Soldier’s Journey,” highlighting its larger significance. "Today’s not about me, this sculpture is not about me. I am in service of something way larger than myself,” Sabin remarks. His journey began from humble beginnings, starting at age 19 without even knowing what a portfolio was, and now, 41 years later, he’s completed this monumental 60-foot-long, 38-figure composition. The sculpture draws inspiration from the experiences of veterans, symbolizing "our unlimited potential as human beings” and incorporating elements of nobility, suffering, and healing. Sabin emphasizes that this artwork is for the public: "This sculpture is for you… It is about human beings, every single aspect in expression of how we feel.” His wife and project manager, Rachel, questions him on the parallels between his personal and artistic journeys. Sabin explains that the experience taught him to "believe in the sacred” and create a work that elevates people and embodies American cultural excellence, reflecting on the veterans who served as models and the spiritual transformation the project brought him. Part ONE:  Part Two:  Part THREE: In the second part of their conversation, Sabin Howard and his wife Rachel discuss the upcoming unveiling of the National World War I Memorial and its impact. Sabin emphasizes the sculpture’s deep human connection, describing it as a way of bringing people together. “I’ve taken art, putting it in your hands,” he says, noting the sculpture’s role in fostering unity. Reflecting on the horrors of war, Sabin recalls a childhood memory of seeing a stark image from the Vietnam War, which continues to shape his artistic vision. He discusses the destructive forces threatening societal cohesion and how his work aims to counter that by creating art that highlights interconnectedness. Sabin points out that the sculpture’s themes of suffering, sacrifice, and healing are universal, adding, "We are all made in God’s image.” Sabin also stresses the importance of preserving history through monuments, warning that erasing historical memory can lead to societal decay. He sees his art as a way to inspire and unite people, aspiring to create more memorials that celebrate American exceptionalism. The memorial, Sabin hopes, will “rebuild our country with beauty,” focusing on humanity and resilience over destruction.  Part FOUR:

Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts about the assassination attempts on President Trump.  Eric Prince raised concerns about the federal government and law enforcement’s handling of political violence and threats, particularly against Donald Trump. He criticized the FBI, referencing their actions in Florida and the raid on Mar-a-Lago, questioning their ability to seek truth. Prince emphasized that Florida should lead investigations due to the federal government’s lack of credibility. He also described an attempted assassination on Trump by an individual who was seeking recognition as a left-wing hero. Prince highlighted the need for more robust security measures, suggesting that private sector and special operations forces could be used to protect Trump by anticipating potential threats. He stressed that maintaining the safety of presidential candidates is crucial for national security and election integrity, expressing gratitude for Trump’s survival while calling for the left to denounce violence.  Mike Benz criticized the official narrative about Ryan Ruth, dismissing it as nonsense. He claims Ruth was heavily involved in recruiting foreign fighters, particularly from regions like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, to join the Ukrainian conflict. Benz highlighted Ruth’s role in collecting passports from terrorists and securing visas for them to enter Ukraine, bypassing local embassies. He drew parallels to a previous “visas for terrorists” operation detailed by Michael Springman, a former State Department official, which involved the CIA facilitating visas for the 9/11 hijackers. Benz argues that Ruth’s actions reflect a continuation of similar covert operations, implicating U.S. intelligence agencies.  Matt Boyle from Breitbart discussed the recent assassination attempts on former President Trump, highlighting severe security lapses within the U.S. Secret Service. Over two months, two individuals exploited weaknesses in Trump’s security detail, with one attacker successfully firing shots, wounding Trump and killing a person. In the second incident, a Secret Service agent intercepted a gunman near Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course. Boyle questioned how attackers pinpointed Trump’s location, given the non-public nature of his schedule, speculating potential insider involvement from Trump’s campaign, the FBI, or Homeland Security. Boyle further criticized the lack of transparency from federal agencies and praised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for initiating a state investigation. The rhetoric of left-wing media was also scrutinized, linking the shooter’s radicalization to his consumption of mainstream media and engagement with political figures. Boyle raised concerns about FBI bias, urging congressional action to ensure the safety of Trump and his family.  Luke Mahoney, Matt Boyle, and Alex DeGrasse expressed serious concerns over intelligence warnings of foreign adversaries targeting former President Trump and Senator JD Vance, highlighting unprecedented threats to their security. Mahoney noted the lack of transparency from federal agencies, especially regarding the FBI’s withholding of key information about recent assassination attempts. Boyle criticized the media for radicalizing individuals through inflammatory narratives, pointing out the suspect’s extreme views fueled by left-wing rhetoric. DeGrasse stressed the need for urgent congressional action and a deeper investigation into how assailants could track Trump’s movements. He also raised concerns about potential federal involvement in the assailants’ activities. All three called for greater accountability from federal agencies, stronger security measures, and more aggressive action from Congress to protect Trump, noting that drastic times require drastic measures. They also discussed the shifting voter registration landscape in Pennsylvania, with Republicans gaining ground on Democrats, which could impact future elections. Part ONE: Part TWO:   Alex DeGrasse’s comments emphasize the importance of vigilance in political campaigns. He highlights a scheme by a secretive group that allegedly recruited far-right candidates to pull votes from Republicans in battleground races. DeGrasse warns that Democratic operatives may infiltrate online discussions to manipulate GOP efforts, stressing the need for caution when engaging with unfamiliar individuals. He also discusses how early voting can play a decisive role in securing election victories, particularly in key states like Pennsylvania. He calls on Trump supporters to become poll watchers and ensure that ballots are properly counted. Additionally, DeGrasse underscores the need to target specific districts, mobilize voters, and raise financial support to ensure a robust early voting effort. The ultimate goal is to secure enough votes to avoid potential election day challenges and ensure Republican victories in crucial races.  Alex DeGrasse and Luke Mahoney emphasize the urgency of grassroots involvement in the final stretch before the election. They stress the need for “ramparts action” — working phone lines, canvassing, and recruiting poll watchers to ensure election integrity. A particular focus is on securing early votes in battleground states like Pennsylvania. They highlight a recent revelation of Democrats recruiting far-right candidates to siphon votes from Republicans, underscoring the importance of vigilance in online interactions and campaign operations. DeGrasse warns of potential efforts to undermine GOP campaigns, while Mahoney calls for early voting to mitigate election day risks. Their message is clear: grassroots mobilization, securing early votes, and vigilance are key to winning the election.  Alex DeGrasse stresses the importance of early voting in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where securing early votes can create a critical lead before election day. He emphasizes that visible support for Trump through signs and flags is a mental validation for the movement’s strength. DeGrasse calls for voters to engage by ensuring three people they know vote early. He highlights three crucial House races in Pennsylvania that could influence Trump’s victory and warns that Democrats may attempt to overturn the election results using the 14th Amendment. DeGrasse concludes with a call for grassroots action, donations, and vigilance.

Natalie Winters gave her thoughts about Hillary Clinton.  Mike Davis discussed the ever-emerging immigration crisis and exposed why so many influential people prefer controlled immigration over the more orderly, rules-based immigration system in the United States.  Scott Presler passionately encouraged War Room Posse members to check their voter registration status on National Voter Registration Day, urging them to ensure they’re registered at their current address and with their preferred party, especially in closed primary states. He raised concerns about Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, where thousands of voter registration and mail-in ballot applications reportedly remain unprocessed. Presler emphasized that Luzerne is pivotal, being a Democrat stronghold potentially flipping Republican, with the voter registration deadline looming. He warned that delays in processing mail-in ballots could disenfranchise voters, especially in tight election margins, and encouraged everyone to demand accountability. Additionally, he highlighted the increase in Republican mail-in ballot requests in Pennsylvania counties and promoted voter registration among underrepresented groups like hunters and the Amish. Presler urged action, encouraging people to distribute voter registration forms, particularly in colleges and veterans’ organizations, to ensure wider voter participation.  Mike Davis discussed the importance of election officials being transparent about election issues to dispel voters’ concerns and gain the most trust from the public.  In a conversation between Mike Davis and Jeremy Kaufmann, Kaufmann shared his unsettling experience with federal agents visiting his home. He described it as “the least American experience” in his life, noting that the agents refused to identify themselves or explain their presence. Kaufmann, a self-proclaimed libertarian from New Hampshire, believes the visit was intended as political intimidation. He voiced concern that the government is targeting "right-thinking Americans” while ignoring genuine threats, such as "illegal Venezuelan gangs” in other states. Davis echoed these concerns, criticizing the federal government’s lack of resources for protecting key figures like Donald Trump. Kaufmann sees these actions as part of a broader left-wing authoritarian agenda, yet he remains hopeful about New Hampshire’s future, stating, “We still have tens of millions… who hold these Pro Liberty values.” He is determined to continue speaking out, adding, "I’m not planning to let up.”  Lee Smith, author of Disappearing the President, talked about the escalation of the media and other political pundits to set up a narrative that President Trump would have to be shot because of his dangerous narrative.

Natalie Winters talks about her anger toward Mike Johnson and the other Republicans who support him, and she decries the use of a Continuing Resolution and called for the WarRoom audience to use BillBlaster and contact their reps with feedback about doing so. Part One:  Part Two:  Darren Beattie critiques the Biden administration and DOJ for weaponizing institutions against political opponents, especially Donald Trump. He calls the timing of recent events, including Merrick Garland’s “rehabilitation tour,” suspicious, particularly in the context of accusations of institutional corruption. Beattie claims this reflects a broader effort to suppress opposition and points to the “Fed’surrection” narrative as a key example. He criticizes media outlets like 60 Minutes for ignoring valid counterpoints, such as those he raised about Ray Epps, which were excluded from a segment attacking him and Tucker Carlson. Beattie argues that the regime manipulates narratives, portraying Capitol Police as victims while ignoring assassination attempts on Trump. He says, “It’s so pathetic… and gives up the game.” He also condemns the handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, highlighting the human toll and claiming the U.S. has squandered nearly $200 billion in support for a corrupt cause. Beattie criticizes Kamala Harris and others for escalating tensions. He believes Trump stands alone in seeking peace, stating, "He’s the only guy who wants it to end,” contrasting him with the "greedy filth running our country.” Beattie urges Trump to continue confronting these corrupt elements until real change occurs.  In a discussion with Jeff Clark and Kingsley Cortes, they highlighted the weaponization of the Department of Justice (DOJ) against figures like Clark. Kingsley explained that their documentary aimed to show how “Jeff’s only crime is supporting President Trump and believing in the Constitution,” while exposing how such beliefs are treated as criminal in today’s political climate. They emphasize the need for accountability, stating, “It’s not retribution or revenge to hold people accountable.” Jeff Clark reflected on his own targeting, attributing it to his desire to investigate the 2020 election: “I didn’t think that I would ever be such a major target.” The conversation also touched on Steve Bannon’s commitment to the movement, as he conducted an interview with them on the day he was set to report to prison, showcasing his dedication to the cause.  Reagan Reese highlighted concerns regarding CBS News’ potential bias as it prepares to host the vice-presidential debate. She noted that CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, have leadership who previously donated to President Biden’s 2020 campaign. Reese pointed out that the CBS president, though she donated while at ABC News, hasn’t done so since. However, she emphasized that this connection could be a point of contention for the Trump campaign, which has a history of criticizing networks for bias. “The Trump campaign really hit CNN and ABC ahead of both debates on their past bias and connections to the Biden campaign,” Reese said. She also referenced the controversy surrounding the ABC debate, where moderators seemed to target Trump while ignoring false claims by Kamala Harris. With the upcoming vice-presidential debate potentially being the last of the 2024 cycle, Reese expects the Trump campaign to challenge CBS’s impartiality.  Jack Posobiec discussed Steve Bannon’s imprisonment, portraying him as a political prisoner fighting the Deep State. Posobiec noted reports from a former inmate stating that Bannon “is praying every day” and attending church regularly while working behind the scenes for a 2024 victory. He emphasized the need for action, stating, “This isn’t about waiting for someone else to come in… We are the ones that ultimately will fall to.” Posobiec then shifted focus to a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, criticizing The New York Times for initially portraying the suspect, Ryan Wesley Rath, as a “Crusader for causes large and small,” which he likened to glorifying the would-be assassin. Posobiec argued that the media is complicit in inciting such attacks, saying, “Positive press coverage has incited…copycat attackers.” He accused the media of misinformation and propaganda, contrasting their treatment of Trump and his supporters with their portrayal of Rath. Posobiec linked the suspect to Ukraine and migrant crime, promoting his book Bulletproof, which details assassination attempts on Trump. Mark Mitchell and Jack Posobiec offer a detailed analysis of the current political climate and polling data, with a focus on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Mark Mitchell discusses the stability of polling data, noting, “We’re the only pollster putting out daily data,” which reveals little change despite various political events. He emphasizes that Trump is showing consistent numbers, with recent polls indicating a tight race. “Trump was up five way back at the end of July,” but the current data shows “Trump plus two.” Mitchell points out that even with significant events, such as the DNC or Trump’s controversial incidents, “nothing’s really changed,” suggesting Trump’s lead remains steady. He highlights that independent voters are crucial and that Pennsylvania will be a key battleground state, noting, “Trump is doing eight points better in our polling than he was four years ago.” Jack Posobiec critiques Axios for promoting the “red mirage” narrative, questioning its validity given the current polling data. He argues, “Republicans overperform when Trump is on the ballot” and suggests that despite various shocks to the system, such as Trump’s controversies, “the numbers haven’t really changed.” Posobiec also points out that Kamala Harris struggles with independent voters, who “hate the Biden regime,” and views Trump as a “fresh start” compared to Harris’s perceived continuity with the current administration. Part One:  Part TWO:  Part THREE:  In their discussion, Jack Posobiec and Sam Faddis analyzed significant security failures surrounding Donald Trump, specifically highlighting two assassination attempts. Faddis, reflecting on his Substack article, emphasized that the U.S. government is making a “conscious affirmative decision” not to provide adequate security for Trump, despite his high-profile threats from groups like Iran’s Quds Force. He criticized the lack of surveillance and preparedness, noting how “one drone with an infrared camera” could have easily detected a would-be sniper waiting for 12 hours. Posobiec and Faddis stressed that the media’s portrayal of such incidents, like Ryan Wesley Rath’s assassination attempt, could incite copycat attacks. Posobiec claimed, “The media is complicit,” pointing out that Rath had been in contact with major outlets before the event. The conversation questioned whether these media contacts had foreknowledge of the attack. Faddis concluded by saying, “No reasonable person would think” the government will provide honest responses to these security concerns, emphasizing the dire implications of inadequate protection.  JacK Posobiec and Cliff Maloney discussed critical insights into Pennsylvania’s electoral landscape. Maloney reported, "We have 120 full-time ballot chasers on the ground in Pennsylvania,” and highlighted a significant drop in Democratic mail-in ballot requests, noting, "Democrats are down 303,000 compared to 2020.” He also observed that "the energy is not there for Kamala,” reflecting a decline in enthusiasm compared to past elections. Posobiec expressed doubts about Kamala Harris’s campaign strategy, stating, "I think she’s going to try all the identity politics she can, but there’s no coalition to put together.” Maloney emphasized the strategic importance of President Trump’s upcoming visit to Southeastern Pennsylvania, asserting, "The event at Our Lady of Chestohova is huge for Polish Americans and will resonate more than any ad Harris might run.” The discussion underscored a strategic push to leverage grassroots efforts and counter Democratic advantages.

Natalie Winters talks about Chip Roy coming to the WarRoom on Wednesday to discuss his reason for wanting the Save Act attached to the funding bill, which she is against.  Darren Beattie discusses what he sees as a pattern of suspicious incidents involving President Trump and bomb threats, including a recent event in Long Island. Initially reported as an explosive device near a Trump speech venue, the media quickly dismissed it as a false alarm and labeled those concerned as conspiracy theorists. Beattie highlights an unusual detail: a private citizen, unaffiliated with law enforcement, was training a bomb-detection dog at the same location. He draws parallels between this incident and historical events like 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing, where training exercises coincided with real-world crises. Beattie suggests the possibility of government involvement or cover-ups, criticizing the media for ignoring deeper questions, such as the identity of the private citizen involved and the implications of this peculiar timing. He questions the media’s focus on discrediting figures like Elon Musk rather than investigating these bizarre circumstances further.  Kristan Hawkins discusses the tragic death of Amber, a woman who sought a chemical abortion for her twins in North Carolina but died of sepsis after receiving abortion drugs. Amber missed her surgical appointment and was sent home unsupervised after taking the medication. She fell severely ill, eventually reaching an ER, where despite treatment for infection, a hysterectomy was delayed for 20 hours, and she ultimately died. Hawkins compares this case to another in New Mexico, where Aisha Atkins also died of sepsis following a chemical abortion, but with little media attention, as it occurred in a pro-abortion state. Hawkins criticizes the Biden-Harris administration’s FDA, blaming them for Amber’s death due to their removal of safety protocols for chemical abortions in December 2021. She argues that the administration prioritized expanding abortion access over ensuring the safety of mothers, abandoning safeguards like ultrasounds and follow-up visits that could prevent such tragedies. Hawkins emphasizes the political motivations behind these changes, suggesting they disregarded women’s health. Part One:  Part Two:  Todd Bensman reported to the WarRoom after attending a committee meeting at the US Capitol earlier in the day.  Bensman talked the dangerous situations we can expect in the future because at least 400 terrorists have come over the Southern border.  Joe Allen, sitting in for Steve Bannon, highlights concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal impact. He discusses the growing influence of AI, noting how it has infiltrated daily life like “soulless insects.” Allen criticizes the shift towards reliance on non-human entities, especially in schools and religious settings, where AI is used to guide learning and even spiritual practices. He warns that this “cultural revolution” will increasingly replace human interaction with machines, with AI becoming a dominant companion for many. Allen also points to the surveillance potential of AI, referencing Larry Ellison of Oracle and his vision of AI being used for behavior modification by constantly monitoring individuals. He connects this to broader concerns about privacy erosion, especially post-Patriot Act, where surveillance has stifled political dissent and made privacy seem obsolete. Allen warns that AI’s pervasive surveillance could eventually lead to imprisonment for mere speech, amplifying concerns over personal freedom and autonomy.  Noor Bin Ladin discusses the increasing global push for censorship, particularly against free speech, under the guise of combating misinformation and disinformation. She highlights speeches from figures like Ursula von der Leyen and Hillary Clinton, noting that they call for collaboration between governments, corporations, and institutions to suppress dissent. Ladin argues that these actions are eroding civil liberties, as seen in cases of individuals facing legal consequences for online posts in the U.S., U.K., and Switzerland. She criticizes how these powerful entities determine what constitutes misinformation while being major purveyors of it themselves. Ladin warns that the growing digital surveillance and censorship are leading to a “digital dystopia,” where individuals risk imprisonment for merely expressing dissenting views. She emphasizes the urgency of resisting this control before freedoms are completely lost, pointing out that without free speech, people cannot challenge these oppressive systems.  In the discussion, Tim Hinchcliffe critiques the U.N.’s Global Digital Compact, expressing concern about its underlying motives. While the compact uses appealing language, Hinchcliffe views it as a tool for expanding digital control, censorship, and surveillance under the guise of fostering inclusion and safety. The initiative, set to be debated by the U.N., aims to restructure digital frameworks and address the digital divide, but also introduces broader surveillance measures and tighter data governance. Hinchcliffe highlights that this push aligns with transhumanist goals, where governments and corporations collaborate to enforce control. He questions the potential tensions between globalist and nationalist objectives, as some U.N. member states are defiant towards overarching global governance. Ultimately, the compact is seen as advancing digital authoritarianism, which could further entrench governmental and corporate powers over individuals while limiting dissenting perspectives.

Rep. Tim Burchett discussed the belief that President Trump’s return to Washington is the only thing that can save the United States at this point because the House and Senate are so divided and unwilling to separate themselves from the centralized power of the established order there.  Natalie Winters talked about her feelings over Mike Turner’s social media, where he made critical remarks about Donald Trump.  Noor Bin Ladin talked about the background of the United Nations and talked about what she expected was going to come out of the General Assembly there in New Yorl.   Adam Wren talked about his 6 month investigation into the life of Mike Davis and some of the foundation of his reporting on Davis and Article 3 Project for Politico.  Mike Davis and Andrew Ferguson discuss Ferguson’s background and achievements, highlighting his key roles in confirming Justices Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, transforming the federal judiciary during the Trump administration. Ferguson, formerly the Solicitor General of Virginia, now serves as a Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, where he led major antitrust actions, particularly against Google. The conversation centers on Ferguson’s admiration for Justice Clarence Thomas, emphasizing Thomas’ resilience against ongoing progressive attacks and his unwavering commitment to constitutional principles. Ferguson also reflects on Trump’s judicial appointments, underscoring the importance of selecting judges with strong backbones to withstand leftist pressure. Both agree that Trump’s second term should focus on appointing more originalist judges willing to stand firm under scrutiny, especially regarding critical issues like race, religious liberty, and free speech.  In this discussion, Mike Davis interviews Jeff Clark, a former top Justice Department official under Trump, about the legal and political persecution he has faced. Clark details how he was targeted for providing legal advice on the 2020 election and investigations into election irregularities. He explained how Attorney General Barr had shut down the investigations he had recommended. Clark recounts being smeared by the media, targeted by congressional committees, and having his home raided by the Justice Department. He discusses his involvement in cases led by Fani Willis and Jack Smith, and the implications of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Clark argues that these legal battles represent political persecution, particularly for the defendants on January 6, and calls for consequences for the misuse of justice.

Natalie Winters talks about her disappointment in Speaker Mike Johnson.  Russ Vought warns that moving into a lame-duck session could lead to an omnibus bill, typically rushed after elections and leading to poor policies. He criticizes this process, arguing that it results in massive, unreadable bills passed hastily, and urges Republicans to resist. Vought is concerned that such a bill would fund “woke” federal programs at high levels, undermining potential future efforts by a second Trump administration. He stresses that Republicans should minimize support for the bill, pushing Hakeem Jeffries to carry it. Despite Speaker Johnson’s opposition to large omnibus bills, Vought believes institutional pressures will likely lead to large, hurried bills like in the past. He also refutes fears of a government shutdown, claiming shutdowns often benefit Republicans politically by showing their commitment to their policy objectives and criticizes Washington D.C.’s reluctance to engage in such brinkmanship.  Ed Dowd highlights that economic downturns typically manifest 18 months after policy changes, which are now evident in 2023. He notes a looming commercial real estate crisis and rising credit risks, with no bailout likely. Government hiring and illegal immigration have temporarily buoyed the economy, but this support is fading. He points to the U.S. housing market, where home prices are at an all-time high compared to household income, and investors are buying up lower-priced homes. Dowd suggests easing red tape to build more housing, which could help alleviate the housing crisis, but warns it will take time to see effects.  Mike Benz discusses a letter revealing threats and actions taken by U.S. government agencies, including the FBI and the Justice Department, against individuals. He mentions concerns about withholding information, particularly a manifesto, due to fears of misinformation spreading online. Benz highlights the case of an individual with a long criminal history, protected by authorities despite numerous arrests and an assassination attempt. He suggests possible ties between this person’s wife and the U.S. defense industry, particularly Maximus Corporation, which works with the Department of Defense. Benz questions the wife’s financial backing of activities related to Ukraine recruitment. He also links the defense establishment to efforts against former President Trump, citing multiple national security officials who have opposed Trump since his campaign. Benz implies that the defense sector has played a significant role in attempts to undermine Trump’s presidency, and he raises concerns about censorship and media manipulation in these efforts.  This conversation is a call to action, emphasizing the urgency of getting involved in the 2024 elections. The host, Alex, guest-hosting for Steve Bannon on War Room Battleground, urges listeners to start volunteering now, whether by supporting a candidate or addressing key ballot issues. With 42 days until the election, the message is clear: it’s time for all hands on deck, as early voting is underway in key battleground states. Alex reports that Donald Trump is ramping up his campaign events, focusing on battleground states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, with plans to expand efforts nationwide, including red states like Alabama and swing states like Minnesota and Maine. The discussion touches on Trump’s policy issues, such as preventing foreign control of American farmland and addressing immigration crises, particularly the impact of Haitian and Venezuelan migrants. Trump is running a 50-state strategy, leveraging union dissatisfaction (notably from the Teamsters) and seeing favorable polling in Rust Belt and Sunbelt states. The message also highlights the importance of “ballot chasing” – ensuring that Republican voters return their ballots at a higher rate than Democrats. Volunteers are encouraged to get lists of voters with outstanding ballots and make calls to increase turnout. The conversation underscores that Trump has multiple pathways to securing the 270 electoral votes, with critical support from Senate races and strong grassroots operations. The overarching theme is mobilizing Trump supporters to take action immediately to secure victory in the upcoming election. Part ONE:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Grace Chong talked about the BillBlaster app and emphasized the importance of early voting. She highlighted her efforts by texting and calling voters, particularly in Pennsylvania, from her home in California. Chong also mentioned how crucial it is to get low-propensity voters engaged, noting that early voting helps prevent last-minute issues, citing an example of her mother in 2012, who couldn’t vote due to an accident. Chong stressed the significance of the BillBlaster app, urging people to call their representatives regarding House Resolution 1305, a bill aimed at supporting Steve Bannon. She emphasized the need to get 218 signatures for a discharge petition and encouraged supporters to push daily for this. According to Chong, early voting and using tools like BillBlaster can make a substantial impact, and she urged Bannon’s “Posse” to show their support for him and his causes through these platforms.

Alex Jones expressed admiration for the passion and faith of populists, describing their shared love for God, freedom, and America as “radical” in today’s society. He pointed out that for 30 years, he has consistently opposed wars, standing for peace with information against globalists like Soros and Obama. Discussing recent legal battles, Jones highlighted that InfoWars is facing liquidation while media consolidation favors figures like Soros. Despite these challenges, he vowed to continue broadcasting, provided he is not imprisoned or killed. Jones connected InfoWars’ persecution to a broader globalist agenda aiming to dismantle America. He predicted that Trump’s potential electoral victory will be undermined by fraud and even assassination attempts. He concluded by stressing that the upcoming election is “the most important in modern history,” with threats against Trump symbolizing deep state desperation.  Natalie Winters continued her harsh critique of Speaker Johnson.  Jeff Clark discussed his research on legal cases, particularly focusing on a specific individual’s litigation history. He shared that he used the Westlaw legal research database, which he finds more comprehensive than others, to search for cases where this person was involved. Clark said he examined both federal and state cases, “not even confining it just to California,” and used advanced search logic to identify relevant cases. His findings showed that “she did not argue any cases,” and he couldn’t locate trial transcripts either, which he found suspicious. Clark expressed skepticism, saying, “I’ve never heard of a court in the United States that would not allow you to duplicate a transcript of a public trial.” He hinted at uncovering more information soon, promising “more research” to be released shortly.  Dr. Bradley Thayer testified before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, discussing the multifaceted Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which he described as an ideological and geopolitical struggle. He emphasized that communism, a “Western ideology imported into China,” is central to the CCP’s aggression and has caused immense destruction, erasing China’s cultural pillars and killing millions. Thayer argued that understanding the CCP’s communist ideology is critical for Congress and federal agencies to grasp its inherently aggressive nature. He also highlighted that the CCP was a product of “Soviet imperialism,” with its origins deeply rooted in Soviet influence, from which Maoism and Xi Jinping’s modern ideology evolved. Thayer declared the CCP illegitimate for three reasons: its foundation in Soviet imperialism, its continuation of failed communist ideology, and its corrupt leadership under Xi Jinping, which only rules for itself. He concluded that the U.S. is in a “new Cold War” with China, calling it the great struggle of the 21st century, one that will determine whether the world remains free or succumbs to totalitarianism led by the CCP.  Dr. Braley Thayer highlights the significant threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in a comprehensive analysis. He emphasizes that their ideology, rooted in communism, makes them “hyper-aggressive,” viewing the U.S. as the primary obstacle to their global dominance. Thayer notes the CCP’s proficiency in “political warfare,” a strategy that allows them to achieve political objectives without direct military conflict, particularly aiming to undermine the U.S. from within. He credits Deng Xiaoping as a master of this strategy, enabling China to rise economically by integrating into global systems and exploiting U.S. investment, trade, and manufacturing. Thayer warns that current Chinese leader Xi Jinping is “extremely dangerous,” comparing his ambition to surpass even Mao Zedong. He describes China as a “bad driver” operating a “Soviet knockoff” car with flawed, aggressive communist ideology. This combination, along with volatile international conditions, creates a precarious situation. Thayer calls for ending economic engagement with China, asserting that U.S. trade and investment are saving the CCP during their current economic struggles. He concludes by urging global efforts to support the Chinese people in overthrowing the illegitimate regime, comparing the CCP’s rule to apartheid South Africa.  In a discussion involving Captain James Fanell, Sam Faddis, and Dr. Braley Thayer, the focus was on Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Waltz and his extensive connections to China, having visited the People’s Republic of China over 30 times since 1989. Sam Faddis questioned the legitimacy of Waltz’s business ties and his continuous access to China, noting that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would not allow such engagement without approval. "This whole business with Waltz just stinks,” Faddis remarked, expressing disbelief in the narrative that Waltz was advocating for democracy during his time in China. Faddis highlighted the potential dangers posed by Waltz’s involvement with China, particularly the risk of Chinese intelligence (MSS) targeting American students who accompanied Waltz on his trips. He questioned whether Waltz was naive or complicit in exposing these students to Chinese influence, suggesting that "clearly, he’s chosen a side, and it’s not ours.” Captain Fennell added to the conversation by discussing the CCP’s aggressive military actions, including a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. He emphasized that the CCP’s expansion of its nuclear arsenal presents a significant threat to U.S. national security. The panel agreed that the U.S. has failed to effectively counter CCP influence, allowing political warfare, propaganda, and infiltration to compromise American elites. Faddis warned, "The war is already started, and they’re winning because we’re not fighting back,” stressing the need for a drastic shift in U.S. strategy to disengage from China and prioritize domestic interests.

Mike Howell expressed frustration with Congress’s inaction, emphasizing the need for more aggressive enforcement of subpoenas. He criticized the tendency to issue subpoenas without follow-through, stating that “a subpoena is worthless unless you actually enforce it.” Howell urged Congress to pursue federal court action to obtain crucial information, like databases of non-detained illegal aliens, including those with criminal records such as “rapists and pedophiles and murderers.” He proposed comparing this list with voter rolls to ensure the election is decided by legitimate voters. Howell lamented Congress’s reluctance to act decisively, saying, “They’re not going to court, they’re not fighting these things,” and urged lawmakers to “see this one through.” He dismissed media attention on the issue as inconsequential, noting that it’s not a topic of interest for mainstream outlets like Vanity Fair or The New York Times but rather “low level stuff” covered by smaller outlets like The Hill.  Natalie Winters talked about battleground states.  Phillip Patrick criticized Kamala Harris’s economic policies as a continuation of Bidenomics, which he views as ineffective. Harris’s proposed tax increases on capital gains, dividends, and even unrealized gains, along with her plans for increased spending, resemble an effort to “buy votes” through short-term relief at the expense of long-term stability. In contrast, Patrick praised Trump’s economic strategy, highlighting its focus on fostering a business-friendly environment by reducing corporate taxes and not increasing individual or capital gains taxes. He acknowledged the controversial tariffs Trump proposes, particularly a 20% tariff on all imports and 60% on Chinese goods, which would cause higher prices initially but lead to long-term economic gains by boosting American manufacturing. Patrick also criticized Harris’s housing proposals, arguing that injecting more money into the economy would worsen inflation. He concluded that Trump’s willingness to make tough decisions makes him the stronger candidate for economic reform.  Jeff Clark highlighted a 2008 case involving an illegal immigrant who brutally raped a woman on a San Francisco party bus while Kamala Harris was district attorney. Despite Harris’s reputation as a tough-on-crime prosecutor, the offender received a lenient three-year sentence. Clark expressed outrage, emphasizing the severity of the crime and Harris’s failure to deliver justice. He criticized Harris for presenting herself as a defender against sex crimes while letting an illegal alien with a criminal record off lightly. Clark argued that this case shatters the myth of Harris’s prosecutorial toughness, especially when contrasted with her current stance on border security. He urged people to spread this story widely, claiming it reveals inconsistencies in Harris’s record. Clark also mentioned the eventual civil lawsuit, which awarded the victim a multimillion-dollar settlement, further spotlighting the failures of Harris’s case handling.  In the discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Paoletta, they criticize proposed Democratic efforts to reform the U.S. Supreme Court. Paoletta argues that the bill in question aims to undermine the court’s independence by expanding its size, imposing audits on justices, and enforcing new recusal rules. He compares these efforts to Hugo Chavez’s manipulation of Venezuela’s judiciary, suggesting that Democrats seek control over the court because they oppose recent rulings on issues like affirmative action and presidential immunity. Paoletta emphasizes that Congress, with its low approval rating, should focus on its own issues rather than trying to reshape the judiciary. He also highlights what he perceives as hypocrisy, where ethical concerns are selectively applied to conservative justices like Clarence Thomas while ignoring similar conflicts involving liberal justices. Ultimately, Paoletta sees these efforts as a broader assault on the Supreme Court’s integrity and constitutional role.  In a conversation between Ben Harnwell and Kristi Hamrick, they discussed the disproportionate impact of abortion on the Black community, referencing Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger, who advocated for controlling populations she deemed undesirable. Hamrick emphasized the national tragedy of abortion, particularly highlighting the high number of Black lives lost: “More Black children are aborted than born in New York City.” They also discussed the dangers of chemical abortion pills, which Hamrick described as having a higher risk of complications and death than surgical abortions: “They have four times the rate of accidents, 10 times the death rate of surgical abortion.” She criticized the lack of safety protocols, such as requiring ultrasounds to prevent complications from ectopic pregnancies. Hamrick further noted that the pro-life movement is the civil rights movement of today, drawing parallels to historical struggles for human rights. She warned Republicans not to back down, urging them to “stand strong” in defending life against what she called the “radical” Democratic stance supporting abortion up to birth. She concluded by promoting pro-life advocacy resources, including Students for Life and information on chemical abortion risks.  In their discussion, Linda Szynkowicz and Ben Harnwell highlighted significant irregularities with postal ballots in Florida, calling it the “Florida debacle.” Szynkowicz mentioned that half a million undeliverable ballots were wrongly counted in the primary, raising concerns about election integrity. She pointed out discrepancies in Miami-Dade and Pinellas Counties, where initial claims of 219,000 absentee ballot requests were later reduced to 20. Szynkowicz also expressed alarm over overseas ballots, noting the DNC’s push for 9 million U.S. citizens abroad to vote, despite only 2.4 million being eligible and no verification of voter IDs.  In their conversation, Ben Harnwell and Richard Stern discussed the economic consequences of President Biden’s proposal to offer $25,000 to first-time homebuyers. Stern warned that while it may seem beneficial on the surface, such government handouts inevitably lead to inflation. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” Stern said, pointing out that increasing government spending devalues the dollar, reducing the purchasing power of everyone else. Stern also noted that the funds required for these policies are taken from other sectors of the economy, leading to job losses and decreased investment elsewhere. He described the situation as a “Sophie’s choice,” where the government redistributes wealth through inflation without actually producing anything. Additionally, they touched on the increasing national debt and the rising costs of interest repayments, which Stern emphasized as a looming crisis. He highlighted that the U.S. is now spending more on interest payments than on defense, warning that the country faces either a debt spiral or hyperinflation. Stern expressed skepticism over the government’s ability to build 4.2 million homes efficiently, cautioning that such efforts often lead to scarcity in construction materials and further inflation.

Liz Harrington focused on the backlash against members of Georgia’s State Election Board, particularly women, who are under threat for promoting transparency and accountability in Georgia’s elections. These board members passed rules to reconcile vote counts to ensure the number of votes matches the number of voters, sparking opposition. Critics, including some from Fulton County and figures like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, are pushing back, fearing the implications of the board’s efforts to address issues like duplicate ballots. The speaker highlights the hypocrisy of media outlets like MSNBC for not defending these women despite their efforts to ensure election integrity. The commentary also references broader narratives about election integrity concerns and critiques of establishment figures.  Jenny Beth Martin provided insight into Georgia’s election integrity efforts, focusing on the ongoing fight to ensure transparent and accountable elections. She expressed approval of Governor Kemp’s decision not to remove members of the state election board, noting it as consistent with his prior actions. Martin emphasized that the board’s new rules, which reconcile vote counts and ensure ballots match voter turnout, are legal and essential for building trust in election outcomes. She also acknowledged potential legal challenges from Democrats but remained confident the rules would hold up in court. Martin encouraged grassroots action, highlighting opportunities like poll watching, phone banking, and door knocking through her organization, urging supporters not to be discouraged but to stay engaged. Lastly, she called on Governor Kemp to continue supporting election board members in their work to secure Georgia’s elections.  Todd Bensman discussed the Biden administration’s new strategy of granting refugee status to economic migrants from Latin America, which allows them to be flown into the U.S. at taxpayer expense. “We don’t normally give refugee status to Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans,” Bensman explained, highlighting the shift in policy. He criticized this approach, noting, “Whole families can board a commercial flight on a travel loan backed by U.S. State Department funds.” Bensman emphasized that this program, though legal, is largely invisible and serves to increase refugee numbers without public scrutiny. He also touched on Panama’s new president promising to close the Darien Gap, a major migration route, but noted that the U.S. is not providing enough support. "The promised American support is falling short,” he said, adding that migration numbers through the Darien Gap remain high despite repatriation efforts.  Natalie Winters talks about her ideas for the proper use of Ukraine funding.  Natalie Winters talks about the level of betrayal of Liz Cheney endorsing radical Democrat Kamala Harris for President.  Noor Bin Laden criticized NATO for its role in promoting “cognitive warfare” while ironically naming its program after the same tactics it has long employed. She claimed NATO has been "weaponizing and devising narratives” to subvert political movements globally, including Ukraine and right-wing populist movements like Brexit and MAGA. Bin Laden highlighted the use of “disinformation” to undermine sovereign nations, pointing to globalist agendas supported by NATO and other institutions like the UN, which she believes are working together since their post-World War II inception. She further linked NATO to globalist efforts, suggesting that disinformation campaigns aim to erode national sovereignty. "They deploy these weapons because we stand in the way of their new world order,” she stated. Bin Laden also touched on how platforms like Twitter are manipulated under a "honey pot slash data mining operation,” casting doubt on Elon Musk’s actions regarding free speech. She underscored that understanding these techniques is key to resisting "globalism” and "communism 2.0.”  Sam Faddis has criticized the current narratives surrounding U.S. foreign policy and election integrity, calling them misleading and harmful. Faddis argues that the ongoing war in Ukraine, which he deems an opportunity for corporate profit, risks escalating into a larger conflict. “This policy…has us dancing right along the knife’s edge of a much bigger conflict and potentially a nuclear exchange,” he warns. He agrees with Donald Trump’s stance that a negotiated solution would end the conflict, emphasizing that “we can end this in effect anytime we want.” Addressing recent claims about Russian interference in U.S. politics, Faddis dismisses them as part of a “Russian collusion hoax.” He criticizes the portrayal of Trump as a Russian ally, stating that “anybody with common sense” would recognize Putin’s disinterest in dealing with Trump. Faddis also condemns the narrative that questions about election integrity are part of a Russian plot, arguing it serves to silence legitimate concerns. “If you raise any questions about the Integrity of the system you’re doing Putin’s bidding,” he asserts.

On Monday’s WarRoom, Ben Bergquam criticized the Biden administration for abandoning border wall materials, wasting taxpayer money, and allowing the border to remain porous. He highlighted the story of Coptic Christians from Egypt who were held captive by the Sinaloa cartel for 12 days while attempting to seek asylum in the U.S. Bergquam argued that Biden and Harris’s border policies enable cartels to exploit vulnerable migrants and facilitate drug and human trafficking. He emphasized the ongoing crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, accusing Biden and Harris of lying about border security. He warned that the continued neglect of immigration issues would lead to the collapse of American sovereignty, stressing that the future of the country hinges on strong border enforcement and leadership change in Washington.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene voiced strong criticism of the Biden administration’s handling of illegal immigration, the Ukraine war, and the two-tier justice system. She condemned the impact of immigration on small towns, describing how the influx of migrants has overwhelmed local resources. Greene cited "unbelievable” reports of pets being harmed and schools being strained due to an influx of non-English-speaking students. She also accused Biden of failing to prioritize American needs, lamenting that seniors are “literally eating dog food” while funds are sent abroad. Greene criticized the Justice Department’s treatment of January 6th defendants, claiming a two-tiered justice system. She highlighted how innocent people, including veterans and grandmothers, are being unfairly prosecuted while cities like Washington D.C. face rising crime. Greene called for greater accountability and action ahead of the 2024 election, insisting that Americans are fed up with the current administration’s policies and the justice system’s perceived bias.  Natalie Winters shared her frustration with illegal immigration and with Mike Rogers.  At Club 47 in Palm Beach County, there was a special screening of the documentary Government Gangsters, based on Kash Patel’s book. The film highlights the actions of the Deep State, covering scandals like Russiagate and the Hunter Biden laptop controversy. It also criticizes figures like FBI Director Christopher Wray and former Director James Comey, exposing their alleged misconduct. The documentary supports Donald Trump and critiques political dynasties like the Bidens, Clintons, and Cheneys. The discussion touched on Liz Cheney’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, seen as part of the political establishment’s opposition to Trump’s anti-war policies. The film tour is set to continue nationwide.  In a discussion between Brian Schimming, Wisconsin GOP chairman, and Jayne Zirkle, Schimming highlighted the strong support for Donald Trump during a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, where over 10,000 attendees gathered. Schimming emphasized key issues driving Republican support in the state, notably the economy, inflation, border security, and violent crime. He described how illegal immigration is impacting local communities and noted the GOP’s focus on election integrity, recruiting 6,000 poll workers and deploying thousands of observers. Schimming also addressed the challenge of mobilizing new voters, including college students and groups like hunters who may not traditionally vote Republican but align with key issues like the Second Amendment. He emphasized the importance of early voting and grassroots efforts, primarily through the Trump campaign’s “Trump Force 47” initiative, aimed at recruiting volunteers and reaching out to neglected voter bases. Schimming concluded by urging active participation in the final critical weeks leading up to the election, stressing that saving America is the ultimate goal.  Jayne Zirkle and Mike Gableman discussed the significant impact of a recent shift in the Wisconsin Supreme Court from a conservative to a liberal majority. Gableman criticized the court’s recent ruling, which allowed unsupervised ballot drop boxes, overturning a previous decision that had banned them. He expressed concerns that this ruling could lead to absurd situations, such as ballots being collected in unsecure places. Gableman also emphasized the importance of voter turnout, urging people to pray and work diligently to ensure that Donald Trump is supported in the upcoming election. He stressed the need for active engagement and outreach to increase voter participation, especially given the narrow margins in past elections. Additionally, Gableman criticized Wisconsin’s Republican leadership, particularly Speaker Robin Vos, for his perceived lack of support for Trump.  Jayne Zirkle and Sam Markstein discussed the recent Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) conference in Las Vegas, highlighting its significance given the recent turmoil in the Middle East. Markstein emphasized that the RJC remains crucial in the political landscape, particularly in light of the tragic Hamas attacks and the murder of six hostages. He noted the Republican Party’s strong support for Israel, contrasting it with what he views as inadequate support from the current administration. Markstein criticized the Biden administration’s handling of international relations and anti-Semitism, citing the increased influence of Iranian-backed groups and anti-Semitic incidents on U.S. college campuses. He praised President Trump’s past policies, which he believes ensured better security for Jewish communities and a firmer stance against terrorism. Markstein expressed hope that Jewish voters will continue to lean towards the Republican Party, as demonstrated by growing support in key battleground states. He urged listeners to engage with and support the RJC for continued advocacy and influence.  Noah Formica, a grassroots leader with Turning Point Action in Pennsylvania, discussed the upcoming debate watch party at the Greater Philly Expo Center with Scott Pressler. He highlighted the event’s importance for rallying supporters and focusing on key issues for Pennsylvania voters. Formica hopes President Trump will emphasize his stance on oil and gas policies, gun rights, and his opposition to Kamala Harris’s proposed regulations. He also addressed concerns about voter integrity, noting that local GOPs are working to highlight issues with mail-in ballots and voter registration. Despite challenges, Formica reported a strong push to engage voters and improve mail-in ballot efforts, with notable progress in GOP requests compared to Democrats. He encouraged supporters to follow him on Twitter and engage with Turning Point Action through their website.

Of course, Bannon puts it in perspective, considering the source! “The New York Times, this morning, … has deemed your show, “War Room”, No. 1 in the nation as far as correct information about what reality is… By the way, the CCP-owned and -operated Brooking Institute did a study… they said 20 percent of our podcast has misinformation about the vax, about Ukraine… War Room will always be No. 1 as far as accurate information about reality!”

Natalie Winters responded to the Vanity Fair article about Steve Bannon and the WarRoom, criticizing people who are continuing to support Ukraine as a priority for American spending.  Darren Beattie discussed the investigations of the Pipe bombs from Jan. 6th, 2021, and a new report that he has been following and reporting on—showing Federal informant involvement on that date. He questioned the timing of holding the report back until after the November election.  Mike Benz talked about the CIA and the DOD and their operations and talked about his suspicion over a case with a person who had been detained for terrorism being delayed.  Natalie Winters referred to the Vanity Fair article about Steve Bannon.  In this conversation between Ben Harnwell and Brandon Showalter of The Christian Post, they discussed recent data from the CDC, which showed 3.3% of high school students identify as transgender, with an additional 2.2% questioning their gender. Showalter argued that this is not a natural phenomenon, but the result of “ideological indoctrination” within schools. He claimed that the concept of being “born in the wrong body” is an “anthropological falsehood” and part of a broader agenda. Showalter emphasized the dangers of medical treatments for gender dysphoria, likening gender-affirming care to “atrocious medical scandals” such as lobotomies. He criticized the inconsistency of allowing gender transition procedures for minors while prohibiting tattoos. Showalter also noted how some European countries are scaling back on such treatments, contrasting them with the U.S. and Canada, which are continuing these practices.  He concluded by promoting his documentary series, Generation Indoctrination, which explores the transgender debate and its impact on families In their conversation, Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell discussed the state of polling and media narratives surrounding the 2024 presidential race. Mitchell expressed satisfaction that Rasmussen’s predictions, particularly about Donald Trump leading Joe Biden, have been accurate, saying, "I should be taking a victory lap.” He noted that the polls have consistently shown Trump ahead, and media claims of sudden shifts are misleading, with the polling staying “locked in steady.” Mitchell emphasized that Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, has consistently struggled, saying, “She overwhelmingly lost” when compared to a “fresh start” candidate. He also pointed out the media’s efforts to paint her as a strong contender, despite her own admission of being an underdog. Referring to Trump’s dominance, Mitchell remarked, "She needs an act of God to win.” They also touched on betting markets, where Mitchell explained that Trump’s chances have dramatically increased, with movements in key battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, now leaning towards Trump. He concluded that, despite some denial in the media, the numbers clearly indicate that “Trump is winning this thing,” and that even poll aggregators like Nate Silver may soon reflect this reality.   Ben Harnwell and Col. John Mills, Mills discusses concerns over foreign influence on U.S. elections, the effectiveness of intelligence agencies, and the integrity of election laws. Mills shares details about a meeting with intelligence agencies, including the FBI and Homeland Security, where officials briefed about foreign involvement in U.S. elections. Mills was critical, saying, “For $80 billion a year, we’re not necessarily getting our top people.” He questioned why U.S. Code 611, which requires U.S. citizenship to vote, was omitted from discussions on election laws: “It’s not debatable. You have to be a U.S. citizen to vote.” Mills also raised concerns about a deep-state agenda, suggesting that intelligence agencies might use election interference as a pretext to expand domestic spying. He said, “They want to go after populists… they want to manipulate the vote.” Mills also pointed out discrepancies, such as the omission of assassination attempts by Iranian operatives, linking Iran’s actions to China’s influence: “Iran would not exist today if it wasn’t for China.” The conversation highlights skepticism about the intelligence community’s handling of election security and foreign interference.  Ben Harnwell and Sigal Chattah discussed the urgency of ballot harvesting efforts in Nevada ahead of the 2024 election, following its decriminalization in 2020. Chattah emphasized the need for action, saying, “We are officially going to start changing gears to ballot harvesting operations,” and highlighted the involvement of groups like America First, Turning Point USA, and others. She encouraged voters to speak to neighbors and ensure they vote, noting that economic challenges, such as a 22% inflation rate and high gas prices, can only be addressed by supporting Donald Trump. Chattah also stressed the importance of voting down ballot to maintain the Republican majority in Nevada’s legislature. She warned, “If Republicans do not maintain the Senate this legislative cycle, we will see a state income tax passed.” She urged people to sign up at the Nevada GOP website and join the ballot-harvesting efforts. Chattah mentioned Trump’s upcoming events in Reno and encouraged participation while reminding listeners of her observance of Yom Kippur.  Grace Chong’s comments highlight the significant influence of Steve Bannon’s War Room show and its dedicated audience, which she calls the “Army of the Awakened.” Chong enthusiastically shares that a recent Vanity Fair article acknowledges the War Room’s impact, especially noting how Bannon has turned the show into a platform for educating everyday Americans on the global power structure. She emphasizes that Bannon’s reference to his audience as “peasants” is a badge of honor, symbolizing their crucial role in challenging the elite and corrupt systems. According to Chong, Bannon views the movement’s strength as lying in the ordinary Americans, who together can make a difference. Chong encourages the War Room Posse to read the article and keep the momentum going, especially as early voting begins across crucial battleground states. She stresses the importance of ensuring voter registration before deadlines in states like North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada. Additionally, Chong highlights the need for early ballot chasing to counter the Democrats’ extended efforts in the previous election cycle. She motivates the audience to stay involved, urging them to spread the word and continue their activism, which she says is visibly shaking the system.   Chong also thanks everyone who has sent JoJo encouraging notes to uplift her spirits. JoJo has also shared these notes with the WarRoom team for encouragement, reporting that the team likes to talk about the supportive messages they are getting.

Natalie Winters discussed her theories about a looming disinformation censorship campaign, a House memo on misinformation on social media, Barack Obama, and children being taught to identify misinformation.  Jeff Lark and Eric Teetsel from the Center for Renewing America reacted to an Axios article. They confirmed that they believe Democrats will allow them to skip the certification process when President Trump wins.  Tom Fitton from Judicial Watch group discussed their efforts to ensure election integrity and combat corruption in government. Judicial Watch has been actively involved in legal battles to clean up voter rolls, leading to the removal of over four million names across the country. Fitton emphasized the importance of states maintaining accurate voter rolls, stating, “You just can’t be mailing out ballots to dirty lists.” Fitton also criticized the Biden administration’s spending on illegal immigration while neglecting American citizens, particularly in crises, calling it “an invasion” that undermines the country. He expressed frustration with Congress for not fulfilling their oversight responsibilities, saying, “They do some hearings, but a lot more needs to be done.” Judicial Watch is also involved in lawsuits exposing “woke” DEI mandates in military academies, which Fitton argued are alienating future military leaders by promoting left-wing ideologies. He underscored the need to fight back against these policies, calling them “outrageously taught.” Fitton concluded by urging the public to stay informed about Judicial Watch’s work, stating that their fight on these essential issues is critical to “the future of the country.”  Brandon Straka provided an update on his latest work with the WalkAway campaign, emphasizing the continued exodus from the Democratic Party. He released a new video, a “sequel” to his original WalkAway video, highlighting the erosion of freedoms, culture, and voting systems under Democratic leadership. Straka explained, "We’re texting one million undecided voters in swing states,” with a focus on racial minorities, pointing to Obama’s recent attempt to sway Black men toward Kamala Harris. He noted that people are increasingly questioning traditional generational voting patterns, particularly in minority communities. Straka discussed how fear, instilled by left-wing media, keeps many loyal to the Democratic Party. His outreach includes minority town halls and educational videos to challenge media narratives. He also mentioned that the WalkAway movement now includes high-profile figures, like Cherie Currie and Susan Olsen, leaving Hollywood and speaking out against the left’s “woke agenda.” Straka concluded by encouraging people to join the movement, stating, "I don’t want to be part of the further degradation of our country.”  Tina Desovich, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, shared her thoughts on the media’s push of transgender ideology, particularly in schools. She highlighted alarming statistics, noting, "Five and a half percent of American students are either identifying as transgender or questioning their gender,” calling it an epidemic. Desovich expressed concern over schools teaching children as young as four that they can change their gender, saying, "When you send your child to public school, what are they teaching them about their gender?” She emphasized the role of Moms for Liberty in empowering parents to reclaim control over their children’s education, medical care, and religion. The organization provides resources and tools, including model policies for school districts, to counteract gender ideology. Desovich also discussed Moms for Liberty’s involvement in a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration’s Title IX rewrite, which they argue undermines protections for girls’ sports and spaces. "We’ve had over 5,000 schools exempt from applying the new Title IX rewrite,” she stated. Desovich reaffirmed the group’s mission to "unify, educate, and empower” parents to protect their children’s rights and education from what she sees as an overreach by schools and the state.  Brian Kennedy emphasized the ongoing concern over election integrity in the U.S., stating, “A lot of Americans think the 2020 election was stolen, maybe half the country.” He noted that despite efforts from groups like Judicial Watch, the system has not significantly changed as the country heads toward the 2024 election. However, Kennedy expressed more confidence in the current state of election systems in key swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, which he believes are improved from 2020. He also echoed President Trump’s approach, saying that in 2024, the focus should be on making the election "too big to rig.” Kennedy criticized Vice President Kamala Harris as a weak candidate, stating, "The more she’s on television, the worse it gets.” He predicted a “suppressed” Democratic vote and an overwhelming turnout for Trump, fueled by dissatisfaction with the current administration and strong support for Trump. Kennedy urged everyone to encourage their friends and family to vote, describing it as a “clarion call” for those who believe in human decency.

Natalie Winters talked about her opinion of the government and her continued themes of why she dislikes Republicans and the GOP.  Derrek Harvey critiques U.S. and Israeli military strategy in responding to attacks from Iran. He acknowledges that the IDF, supported by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, managed to intercept some of the nearly 200 missiles, but he warns that “the strategy of just absorbing attacks from Iran is not going to succeed.” Harvey argues that Iran is willing to sacrifice Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank in its efforts to destroy Israel. He advocates for a direct response, stating, “The only response is going to have to be…damaging their economy,” by targeting Iran’s oil and gas capabilities and military assets. Additionally, Harvey suggests the U.S. should focus on non-combatant evacuations, protecting embassies, and responding decisively if attacked. He criticizes the Biden administration, saying, “We do not understand deterrence” and “winning wars matters because it sets the conditions for peace.”  Mark Mitchell criticizes mainstream media, particularly MSNBC, for dividing America by pushing false narratives. He highlights that “66% of voters are concerned that the outcome of this election will be affected by cheating,” dismissing claims of the “big lie.” Mitchell rebuffs accusations that his polling is right-leaning, stating that even “The New York Times is to the right of us.” He claims media pollsters consistently use tactics like oversampling Democrats, particularly with Kamala Harris, and presents his own firm as unbiased, noting, “Every time anyone gives us a dime, we declare our sponsorship.” Mitchell predicts that Kamala Harris is losing critical swing states like Michigan and faces further challenges, such as supply chain shortages, rising prices, and potential war in the Middle East. He believes this bodes well for Donald Trump, adding, “Trump’s going to outperform the polling.” He emphasizes that these issues could lead to a shift in support away from Harris, as political narratives evolve closer to Election Day.  Mike Benz argues that censorship using AI, particularly regarding public health issues, is not a future threat but something that has already been happening for years. He explains that “AI keywords” have been used to censor online discussions, particularly during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Benz highlights the involvement of figures like Bill Gates, who is a co-investor in U.S. State Department and military endeavors, and claims that Gates benefits from taxpayer-funded efforts to protect his reputation online against conspiracy theories. He explains that a Pentagon contractor, Graphika, received $7 million to use AI to scan conversations in NATO countries and suppress content critical of Gates. This, according to Benz, violates the First Amendment as public health crises are used as “a humanitarian intervention excuse” to justify military and intelligence involvement. He emphasizes that this censorship, designed to protect Gates’ financial empire, is an ongoing reality rather than a hypothetical concern.  In their discussion, Mike Davis and Mark Paoletta highlight the weaponization of law enforcement, drawing parallels between past and present political battles. Davis introduces Paoletta, praising his crucial role in Supreme Court confirmations, especially for Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas. Paoletta recounts his experience during Thomas’s confirmation, emphasizing the left’s viciousness and their attempts to “destroy” Thomas, not just defeat him. He recalls the intense opposition Thomas faced for being a “black man who thinks on his own,” which Paoletta sees as the left’s cardinal sin. Paoletta also reflects on his work defending Thomas and describes how these experiences shaped his understanding of political weaponization. They compare this to the current attacks on Donald Trump, with Davis noting that Trump has been indicted multiple times and faced attempts to remove him from ballots. Davis and Paoletta argue that Trump is facing the same kind of lawfare they saw used against Thomas and other conservative figures. Looking ahead to a potential second Trump administration, Paoletta outlines the need for accountability. He advocates for firing FBI Director Christopher Wray and Special Counsel Jack Smith, dissolving the January 6 unit, and reviewing the prosecutions related to January 6. Paoletta stresses that these steps are crucial to prevent the left’s use of law enforcement to interfere in future elections. Part One:  Part Two:  In a conversation on election integrity, Mike Davis, Cleta Mitchell, and Mark Lucas addressed concerns about non-citizen voting and the challenges posed in swing states like Arizona, Virginia, and Georgia. Mitchell highlighted a report from Arizona, where 218,000 registered voters failed to provide proof of citizenship, a significant increase from the previously identified 98,000. She mentioned officials downplaying the issue, stating, “It’s just a glitch, but it’s a big problem.” In Virginia, a citizens’ group found around 1,000 votes cast by non-citizens, which Mitchell emphasized as a growing issue across the country, noting, “This is their new political majority for the Democrats.” Davis discussed the Article 3 Project’s efforts to push the Save Act, which targets illegal voting, and their campaign to raise awareness. In Georgia, Lucas discussed ongoing legal challenges regarding election machines and board oversight, with Davis emphasizing the tension between state election boards and progressive opposition, stating, “The whole establishment media is howling.” Part One:  Part Two:

Natalie Winters reacts to a news article that calls her out for her remarks about retribution when President Trump is re-elected, saying that certain people will face “Treason” charges.  Winters doubles down, saying Miley will also face “Treason” charges from Trump in her rant.  Davis critiqued the legal and political actions taken against Donald Trump and others associated with him, describing them as part of a broader “lawfare” strategy aimed at undermining Trump’s political career. He argues that Obama, Biden, and their teams engaged in illegal actions, such as the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, to spy on Trump and protect figures like Hillary Clinton. Davis claims Clinton’s actions, including foreign bribery through the Clinton Foundation, were hidden, and similar tactics were used in 2020 to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. He criticizes the indictments against Trump and his allies as politically motivated attempts to interfere with the 2024 election. Davis calls for a criminal investigation into what he views as a conspiracy against Trump, emphasizing that justice, not retribution, should be the goal. He also highlights concerns about a Colorado Supreme Court judge, Monica Marquez, who he believes is a left-wing radical, urging voters to remove her from office due to her extreme views. Part One:  Part Two:  Jim Hoft, in his commentary on The Gateway Pundit, focuses on the alleged overseas voting fraud and media backlash. He highlights that the media, particularly outlets like MSNBC, are now discussing overseas votes after his team exposed the lack of voter ID requirements for overseas ballots. Hoft criticizes the system, claiming that individuals, including non-citizens, can vote using just an email address, without proving citizenship or residency in certain states like Michigan. He argues this loophole can be exploited to sway elections in swing states, noting several lawsuits in states like North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have emerged since his reports. Hoft also dismisses claims that exposing these issues is an attack on military voters, emphasizing that his focus is on potential fraud, not legitimate military votes. He calls on Republicans to take legal action in battleground states to address what he sees as a fraudulent system being used by Democrats to influence the 2024 election.  Benjamin Roberts, associate editor of I’m 1776, discussed the systemic issues in Springfield, Ohio, where NGOs and local churches, often backed by federal subsidies, play a significant role in facilitating the resettlement of Haitian migrants. Roberts revealed that these organizations prioritize migrant housing and employment, often to the detriment of local citizens, including newly homeless Americans. He pointed to Springfield’s mayor, whose LLC rents properties to multi-generational Haitian families, and noted a rise in crime, sexual harassment, and unlicensed driving by migrants. Local women reported being followed in public spaces, but law enforcement often ignored their complaints. Additionally, rising rent costs have displaced many residents, as landlords, sometimes in collaboration with NGOs, prioritize migrant families. Roberts criticized the federal government’s involvement and warned of the broader implications for small American towns overwhelmed by unregulated immigration.  Natalie Winters, again, talked about her dislike of the Republican party.  Caroline Wren criticized the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), led by Mitch McConnell, for its ineffective spending in Republican Senate races. She highlighted SLF’s poor track record over the last four election cycles, pointing out that internal polling used by SLF showed questionable data. Wren questioned why, despite this polling, SLF was allocating funds disproportionately to weaker candidates, such as spending millions on Larry Hogan and Bernie Moreno while neglecting stronger contenders like Carrie Lake and Ted Cruz. Wren suggested that SLF’s decisions are politically motivated, particularly to avoid supporting candidates like Cruz and Lake, who oppose funding for the Ukraine war. She also criticized the consultant culture surrounding SLF, particularly figures like Karl Rove, whom she claims have continuously failed yet still influence campaign spending. Ultimately, Wren argued that SLF’s involvement is a "kiss of death” for candidates and that Donald Trump’s success in key states, rather than SLF’s funding decisions, will determine Republican victories in Senate races. She urged people to disregard the recent SLF polling memo and expressed confidence in candidates like Lake and McCormick, expecting them to win alongside Trump.  Brian Schimming, the Wisconsin GOP chair, shared his insights on the state’s role as a critical battleground for the 2024 election. He emphasized the intensity of the race, noting that Kamala Harris’s multiple visits to cities like Milwaukee and Green Bay signal "panic” in her campaign. "Polling shows Wisconsin and other swing states are within two points,” Schimming explained, adding that Trump is currently up by around one to two points in their internal data. Schimming highlighted how Wisconsin’s history of tight races—decided by fewer than 30,000 votes—makes every voter crucial. Trump’s frequent campaign visits, including stops in La Crosse and Wausau, are energizing grassroots efforts, Schimming said, attracting "thousands of people,” even in rural areas. Trump’s push for early voting also stood out. According to Schimming, Trump encouraged Republicans to vote early, explaining it could "save resources” and target persuadable voters. Schimming emphasized the importance of mobilizing non-voters, particularly among conservative groups. "If we can get even a percentage of these people to vote, Trump will win Wisconsin,” Schimming concluded, calling for volunteers to join the GOP’s efforts in the final weeks of the campaign.  Michele Morrow talked about a debate she is participating in tonight in Southern Pines.  Grace Chong delivered a motivational message to the WarRoor audience, focusing on voter registration and participation as the 2024 election nears. She emphasized the importance of mobilizing support in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. "It’s critical to register voters in these final days,” Chong urged, as voter registration deadlines approach. Chong also stressed the significance of early voting, stating, "We must vote early this year, especially in battleground states.” She explained that securing early votes would provide more time to ensure all ballots are counted and help "beat the Democrats at their own game.” Chong recommended several apps to assist with voter mobilization, including the Early Vote Action app and TP Action app. She encouraged the audience to "get out 10 to 20 people a day” and ensure they follow through by voting. She also reminded people to sign up for the WarRoom.org newsletter for updates on grassroots activism and other articles to share with friends. In closing, Chong reminded listeners of Trump’s supporters’ loyalty, stating, "In January 2020, it was the Posse that had President Trump’s back.” She rallied them for the "home stretch,” encouraging them to stay energized and help "close the deal” by getting Trump reelected.  Jenny Holland discusses the alarming influence of corporate media across Western nations, particularly the way media misrepresents events to fit a globalist agenda. She highlights an analysis by Italian journalist Enrico Francescani, who attributed UK riots not to a tragic murder but to Russian trolls and misinformation. Holland, a media professional, found this narrative shocking, noting that it wasn’t limited to American media but echoed across European outlets as well. She points to a growing “transnational media class” that shares more in common with elites abroad than with their own populations. This disconnect leads to biased reporting, especially regarding nationalist movements. Holland cites a case in Ireland where the fiancé of a murdered woman was unfairly portrayed by the media for advocating for prioritizing citizens. She believes this media distortion contributes to social unrest and public frustration across various nations. Holland continues to write about these issues on her Substack.

VIDEO Natalie WInters talked about how the government elite are using an excuse of misinformation being spread on social media to censor people’s speech online. VIDEO VIDEO Jeremy Carl is an author has believes that President Trump needs to be more aggressive in getting the “White vote” claiming that Trump has not focused on White voters. VIDEO Darren Beattie talked about the MacArthur Fellowship awards being given to people for exhibiting radical far-leftist ideology, including DEI. VIDEO Daily Mail correspondent Katelynn Richardson talked about her latest article that exposes the pressure on parents to affirm their children’s transgender ideas. VIDEO Natalie Winters played a video of Rachel Madow reacting to the Vanity Fair article from last week focusing on Steve Bannon.  Winters reacted and said that people should be more like Steve Bannon than Rachel Maddow. VIDEO Lance Wallnau and Dave Brat delivered powerful messages about the intersection of faith and politics. Wallnau highlighted the importance of Christian civic engagement, recounting a recent event at the National Mall where a quarter of a million people gathered, joined by millions online. He stressed, "There is a movement of Awakening that’s happening,” urging pastors to encourage their congregations to vote, lamenting that "31 million evangelicals will sit out the election” due to pastoral reluctance to address political issues. He argued that encouraging just five million votes could make a difference. Wallnau criticized the media for demonizing Christian involvement in politics, particularly their support for Donald Trump. He also emphasized that Christian values align with political action, drawing from Biblical examples like Daniel’s involvement in political affairs under King Cyrus. "If our angel is supporting a heathen… how much more can we stand with Donald Trump?” Wallnau remarked. Dave Brat expanded on this, addressing the theological misconception that Christians should avoid politics. He called this mindset "bad theology,” noting how America’s prosperity allows for such disengagement. Brat reminded listeners of the founding principles rooted in Christianity, adding that early American institutions like Harvard were steeped in religious ideals. Both Wallnau and Brat argued that the separation of church and state is misunderstood, and that Christian engagement is crucial to preserving the nation’s values. VIDEO Steve Soukup argues that corporations, driven by powerful asset management firms like BlackRock, are prioritizing political agendas over their fiduciary responsibilities to investors. He describes this as “unfair” to people who simply want to invest for retirement or run their businesses without political interference. Soukup highlights how companies are pressured to focus on issues like climate change and diversity, which he believes are secondary to investor returns. He points to the influence of asset management giants—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—collectively managing over $20 trillion. These firms, Soukup claims, decide how businesses should operate based on politics rather than financial priorities. “Larry Fink is the most powerful man in the world,” Soukup asserts, criticizing Fink for using clients’ money to advance political agendas. To counter this trend, Soukup emphasizes the need for grassroots action. He suggests building smaller, independent institutions that resist the influence of large asset managers. Soukup believes that only a "revolution from beneath,” inspired by the principles of America’s founders, can reverse the trend. He calls for an awakening in the financial services world to ensure businesses focus on their core mission of serving investors, not politics. VIDEO Mark Paoletta and Dave Brat highlighted the deep state’s overreach and its impact on everyday Americans. Paoletta emphasized the 33rd anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation, noting his importance in standing up against “the left’s vicious attacks.” He praised both Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch for their strong stance on protecting individuals from the overwhelming number of laws and regulations, which Paoletta called a “blizzard of laws…designed to trip you up.” Paoletta discussed Gorsuch’s focus on how bureaucratic overreach affects ordinary people, referencing a fisherman prosecuted under corporate law for throwing fish back into the water, which “destroyed his life.” He criticized the left’s attempts to discredit conservative justices, particularly Gorsuch and Thomas, and underscored the significance of elections in shaping the Supreme Court. With Election Day approaching, Paoletta stressed that “President Trump is winning” and that voters must respond to the “lies on social media” by supporting Trump’s agenda to “secure our border” and “stamp out violent crime.” He concluded by calling the upcoming election “the most important of our lifetime” and expressed confidence that Trump would win comfortably. VIDEO Grace Chong talked about the process of ballot chasing and said that Steve Bannon sent a message from prison that he wants everyone to work like they are 10 points down.

Natalie Winters discredited former Rep. Liz Cheney for her disruptive actions while she was on the J6 Committee and acting in unethical ways with witnesses.  eff Clark discusses legal concerns surrounding Liz Cheney’s interactions with Cassidy Hutchinson during her representation by attorney Stefan Passantino, suggesting possible legal implications for those involved. He criticizes Cheney’s approach as unethical, claiming that Cheney was involved in secret meetings to prepare Hutchinson’s testimony, which he finds ironic and hypocritical, given Cheney’s past positions. Clark emphasizes that if political dynamics shift, figures like Jack Smith may rely on "prosecutorial immunity” to defend themselves, further adding irony since Smith argued against immunity for Trump. Clark also touches on a broader issue of “weaponized” bar complaints and character assassinations, particularly aimed at Hutchinson’s former lawyer. He expresses disbelief that Passantino would coach Hutchinson to lie, suggesting that her claims against him reflect a deeper ethical problem. He criticizes the media and legal establishment for what he sees as a hypocritical double standard, particularly in relation to Cheney’s conduct. Finally, Clark argues that President Trump’s requests for key documents related to election interference are crucial to his defense but are being improperly restricted by the courts, undermining due process rights.  Jack Posobiec, on Steve Bannon’s War Room, shared his observations about Kamala Harris’s campaign struggles in Pennsylvania. He noted that Harris is failing to engage with local leaders and union members, especially in critical areas like Philadelphia. He contrasted this with Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign, where Obama built independent structures to gain local support. Posobiec criticized Harris’s campaign manager, Nikki Loud, as being out of touch with the ground realities. He also highlighted growing frustrations in Philadelphia over crime and drug issues, with people demanding action. Posobiec further speculated that Harris’s lack of attention to the ground game could signal potential ballot fraud operations. He raised concerns about irregularities in Michigan, citing an imbalance between registered voters and actual citizens in some cities, which he attributes to poor election practices. Posobiec’s discussion underscores a broader worry about the integrity of future elections.  Jonathan Kepperman discussed the FBI’s recent revision of crime statistics and criticized the Biden administration for downplaying rising crime. He pointed out that although the administration claimed crime had decreased by 5.8%, more comprehensive data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed a significant 55% rise in violent crime over the last three years. Kepperman expressed frustration, stating that “people see what’s in front of them,” and accused the government of gaslighting the public about crime, inflation, and immigration. He emphasized that “people are fed up with being lied to” and are increasingly aware of the reality, even if they don’t discuss it openly with their peers. Kepperman called for systemic changes, including “mass deportation” and a “complete overhaul at the FBI,” to address these issues. He urged listeners to follow his work at Passage Press and stay informed on the real crime statistics.  Eli Crane provided an update on Donald Trump’s strong polling lead, noting Trump is 20 points ahead in the betting markets. Crane emphasized that "everything is to play for” as the election approaches, especially in battleground states like Arizona. He expressed disappointment with a recent ruling by a Biden-appointed judge preventing measures to ensure that only legal citizens vote before the election. Crane criticized this decision, saying, "the border is wide open” and suggested that allowing illegal immigrants to vote is part of a broader strategy. He mentioned efforts to challenge election practices, referencing work with figures like Greg Phillips from “2000 Mules.” Crane urged transparency in the election process, encouraging citizens to record any suspicious activity at polling stations. He also highlighted the importance of supporting candidates like Justin Heap, who is fighting to clean up Arizona’s election system, and praised Trump’s momentum in Arizona, noting the energy at recent rallies.  Noah Formica has been actively registering voters across Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. "I have registered 2,750 voters here in the state of Pennsylvania for Donald Trump,” he reported, while traveling across the state. He emphasized the importance of vigilance regarding drop boxes, advising caution since it’s challenging to regulate who uses them. Formica supports Trump’s push for early in-person voting to ensure transparency. Trump is making multiple appearances in Pennsylvania before the voter registration deadline on the 21st, including events in Pittsburgh. Formica highlighted efforts to capitalize on these rallies and encouraged supporters to volunteer, even beyond voter registration, by knocking on doors and making phone calls. For those wanting to assist, Formica directed them to contact him via Twitter (@nformicaGOP) or through the website dpaction.com. “We’ve got to pull out all the stops,” he stressed, urging grassroots participation to maximize voter turnout for Trump.  Salleigh Grubbs, chair of Cobb County GOP in Georgia, expressed concern over recent rulings about election procedures, calling the media’s portrayal “propaganda.” She criticized a Superior Court decision requiring immediate certification of election results despite ongoing Republican efforts to combat voter fraud. “It saddens me,” she said, noting issues like ballots stuck in scanners that inflate vote counts. Grubbs defended the proposed election rules, arguing that they align with Georgia’s legislative acts and are necessary to ensure integrity. “These proposals are common sense,” she insisted, countering claims that the timing of rule changes would cause administrative chaos. She blamed the delays on “previous members of the election board who refused to do their job.” Despite the late introduction of these rules, Grubbs emphasized that the current board members are working diligently to secure fair elections in Georgia, stating that “reasonable members” are now in place to restore trust in the process.  Sophie Georges discussed how minorities fared better under the Trump administration compared to the current one, particularly in homeownership. She highlighted that “the policies during the Trump Administration were beneficial for all Americans,” noting that low inflation and low mortgage rates, around 2%, made homes more affordable. During 2017-2021, homeownership rates increased for Latinos by 4%, Asians by 3%, and Blacks by 2%. In contrast, current high inflation and mortgage rates, now over 6%, have disproportionately harmed ethnic minorities, pushing many into affordable housing categories. Georges noted that “people who were middle class have now fallen into that affordable housing qualifying category” due to rising home prices and a housing shortage. She emphasized that the issue isn’t just policy but competent management of the economy, explaining that “empowerment of people” through homeownership is key to building wealth. Current economic conditions, she added, are creating significant financial strain, especially for retirees who “are hanging by a thread.” Georges shared her research on her website, realsafyrealestate.com, to provide valuable insights on these issues.

Natalie Winters highlights the National Pulse article with Steve Bannons complete statement from prison regarding his incarceration.  Natalie Winters comments on the influx of unvetted Chinese nationals entering the U.S., highlighting that around 60,000 have entered in the past 18 months, with many passing through the southern border. She points out that these Chinese migrants are not typical immigrants but are from the wealthy and elite classes. Winters suggests that they are well-funded, possibly even supported by the Chinese government, and are not living in the U.S. as low-wage workers like many other migrants. Instead, they are affluent professionals, raising concerns about their motivations and the lack of thorough vetting.  Dan Fleuette and Natalie Winters discuss Fleuette’s long association with Steve Bannon. Fleuette has worked with him for over 20 years, starting with a 2003 documentary. Fleuette has been involved in various media projects with Bannon, including graphic novels and documentaries, and continues collaborating with WarRoom Films. He expresses frustration over Bannon’s legal challenges, labeling his imprisonment unjust and a result of a two-tier justice system targeting political opponents. Fleuette highlights the broader issue of "lawfare,” where government power is allegedly used against dissenting voices. The conversation shifts to Fleuette’s latest project, Rebels, Rouges, and Outlaws, a pictorial history featuring portraits, stories, and observations. Fleuette shares his excitement about the project, revealing that Winters is featured in the book, complimenting her on her growth in the media space. He humorously notes that Winters is starting to resemble Bannon in her work, implying her increasing influence in political commentary.  Todd Bensman and Natalie Winters discuss the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, focusing on the influx of migrants, including a significant number of wealthy Chinese nationals. Bensman highlights that many immigrants are closely watching the U.S. elections, fearing a potential Trump victory, which they believe would shut down the border, prompting them to rush into the U.S. He notes that wealthy Chinese immigrants, unlike others, can afford cartel passage due to their financial resources, possibly backed by the Chinese government. Additionally, Bensman observes an influx of migrants from across Asia, Africa, and beyond, turning border towns like Tapachula, Mexico, into overcrowded "pressure cookers” filled with people waiting to cross into the U.S. The Biden administration’s CBP One mobile app allows some to secure appointments for border entry, easing pressure in these towns. Bensman emphasizes the chaotic nature of the situation, with migrants flooding in from around the globe, creating a complex humanitarian and political challenge.  In the discussion between Natalie Winters and Nate Hochman, they talk about the impact of mass immigration on small towns like Charleroi, Pennsylvania, which has seen a significant influx of Haitian immigrants. Hochman a senior advisor for America 2100, describes how Charleroi, a de-industrialized town with just over 4,000 native residents, has been overwhelmed by a 1,500% increase in foreign population since 2020. He emphasizes that the local residents were never consulted about this massive demographic shift, which he describes as part of a broader pattern of small, conservative towns being overwhelmed by immigration, driven by a combination of government programs, NGOs, and big business interests. Hochman suggests that this mass migration is coordinated and punishes these communities for their conservative, pro-America values. He also discusses how the media has downplayed or fact-checked these claims, often relying on a few handpicked activists to dispute the scale of the problem. Hochman and Winters agree that the transformation of these towns has led to significant tensions, with overwhelmed school districts, housing shortages, and strained local resources, yet media coverage often portrays these communities as resistant without addressing the real issues they face.  Joe Allen, standing in for Steve Bannon on War Room, discusses the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its psychological impact on society. He emphasizes that AI has evolved to the point where it can communicate with humans in ways that create the illusion of an entity on the other side. Allen points out that AI systems can now organize and relay information independently, but the real concern is the growing number of people who turn to AI for truth, even on spiritual matters. He cites predictions that AI could give rise to new religions and influence spiritual beliefs. Allen also highlights the political divide surrounding AI, with figures like Sam Altman and Eric Schmidt aligned with the left, while Elon Musk and Peter Thiel lean right. However, Allen stresses that the future will be shaped more by technology than politics, noting that politicians will have to grapple with difficult decisions related to AI and its power. Ultimately, he views this as a spiritual war, with political power secondary to higher, divine guidance.  In their discussion, Noor Bin Ladin and Joe Allen delve into concerns about the “intelligent age” and its technological advancements, particularly as framed by elites like Klaus Schwab and tech figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Bin Ladin praises Allen’s critique of this new era and expresses distrust toward the “progress” being driven by these elites, noting that what they view as a utopia could become a dystopia for the rest of society. She emphasizes that these technological changes often benefit a few while negatively impacting the broader population. While Altman and others seem excited about the digital future, Bin Ladin remains skeptical and concerned about the societal consequences. Despite her reservations about technology’s impact, she remains optimistic, grounded in her belief in God and the human spirit, which she believes will help people overcome the challenges ahead.  Grace Chong emphasized the importance of early voting, urging viewers to participate and mobilize others, while acknowledging that some may prefer voting on election day. Joe Allen confirms he is registered but hasn’t voted yet, expressing his commitment to voting his conscience. He praises Chong for her motivation and energy in rallying the supporters, encouraging everyone to remain positive and focused on achieving victory in the upcoming election. The discussion reflects a sense of urgency and excitement among Trump supporters as they push for turnout in the 2024 election.  In their discussion, Joe Allen and Jennifer Billek delve into the themes of Billek’s book, Transsual: Transgender Transhuman. Billek emphasizes that transgenderism and transhumanism are not merely identities but efforts to redefine humanity through technology. She argues that these movements aim to alter societal perceptions of sexuality, detaching them from biological realities and promoting a synthetic view of identity. Billek critiques the portrayal of these ideologies as organic human rights movements, suggesting instead that they are financially backed by powerful figures and organizations, such as the Pritzker family and Martin Rothblatt, who seek to reshape societal norms. She highlights the potential dangers of such changes, particularly for women, who play a crucial role in reproduction. The conversation underscores concern over how these technological ambitions might undermine the traditional understanding of gender and humanity.

Mike Davis described the legal challenges against President Trump as a coordinated effort to obstruct his election campaign, calling it “election obstruction.” He emphasized that Trump has faced severe financial and legal pressure, saying, “They’ve tried to bankrupt him” and “indicted him four times.” Davis also mentioned underfunding Trump’s Secret Service protection, nearly putting his life at risk. He criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith’s actions as politically motivated, describing the release of “165 paid political documents” just before the 2024 election as “highly unusual” and “unprecedented.” Davis argued that this one-sided narrative amounts to a “political assassination” orchestrated by Democrats, including Kamala Harris, due to fear of Trump’s potential victory. He urged Trump supporters to vote early, warning that this is the latest attempt to interfere with the election.  Sam Faddis expressed strong concerns about an individual with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), describing the situation as alarming. He noted that this person has had decades-long connections with China, frequently traveling there and organizing trips for students, some of which were funded by the CCP. Faddis criticized the lack of transparency around these trips, stating, “He has been… reluctant or simply refuse[d] to provide any detail.” Faddis suggested that if the trips weren’t CCP-funded, the individual would likely be more forthcoming. He also pointed out that the individual wasn’t advocating for democracy in China, which the CCP wouldn’t allow, but was instead praising communism and its ideals. Faddis argued that such close involvement with the CCP raises significant concerns, asserting that this person “shouldn’t come within 10 miles of the vice president’s office.”  Natalie Winters talks about a letter from Adam Shiff.  Jonathan Keeperman criticized conservatives who oppose Trump on moral grounds, labeling them as “cowards” using excuses to avoid supporting policies necessary to “save this country.” He referenced Stephen Miller’s revelation that 500,000 Haitians were flown into the U.S. through a loophole created by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, noting that “nobody asked for this” except a few special interest groups. Keeperman argued that fake conservatives lack the political courage to address this issue and send these individuals back. He praised JD Vance’s debate performance for embracing “Bannonism” and returning to an “America First policy” that prioritizes American interests. Keeperman noted that anyone speaking honestly about such topics would become a target, but highlighted the need for leaders who can focus on critical issues, such as Ukraine and Iran, while also putting Americans first.  Missouri Senator Nick Schroer expressed concerns about rising crime linked to illegal immigration and drug cartels in the St. Louis area. He highlighted the influence of gangs like the Black Mafia Family, which are spreading fentanyl, cocaine, and meth, and criticized the city’s mayor for being connected to a cartel-affiliated individual while doing little to address violent crime. Schroer noted that crime is spreading into suburban areas, including his district, O’Fallon, Missouri, one of the safest small cities in America. He shared alarming incidents involving illegal immigrants, including two stabbings, a police officer being run over, and a murder by Honduran nationals. Schroer criticized ICE for failing to deport known criminals, resulting in tragic outcomes. He emphasized that Missouri has become a “border state” and warned about the erosion of the American dream, advocating for “Freedom Fighters” like himself to stand up and protect citizens’ way of life.  Ben Bergquam commented on the growing issue of illegal immigration, focusing on large numbers of immigrants, especially from Venezuela, Haiti, and other countries, being relocated to cities like Cincinnati and Springfield. He highlighted how these communities are overwhelmed by the influx, with resources strained and local citizens neglected in favor of cheap labor. Bergquam criticized big industries and staffing companies for prioritizing cheaper immigrant labor, contributing to job shortages for American citizens in already struggling areas hit by the decline in steel manufacturing and the fentanyl epidemic. He also emphasized the cultural disconnect and rising crime, such as vehicular accidents. According to Bergquam, local leaders, including mayors, profit from this crisis while ordinary citizens suffer. He argued that this situation is emblematic of a broader national issue, with populist interests being sacrificed for corporate profits, a key theme he sees influencing the 2024 election.  Dave Brat opened the conversation on “War Room” by honoring Steve Bannon and praying for his return, emphasizing his leadership in the grassroots movement. Brat then welcomed Matt Boyle, discussing the lack of mainstream media coverage on the recent debate, especially in outlets like Drudge, New York Times, and Bloomberg. Boyle noted that JD Vance won the debate convincingly, while his opponent, Tim Ryan, struggled, particularly when defending Kamala Harris’ record and making gaffes about school shooters and the administration. Matt Boyle highlighted Vance’s skill at the Vice President’s debate on Tuesday in connecting immigration to economic and social issues, which resonated with voters. He praised Vance’s strong performance and noted that Trump’s judgment in backing Vance demonstrated his ability to pick strong candidates despite opposition from the establishment. They discussed the top voter concerns: inflation, immigration, and public safety, while also noting how abortion and healthcare have dropped in importance since the 2022 elections. Boyle praised Vance for handling traditionally Democratic issues well, turning them into strengths. The conversation ended with predictions of October surprises, including a longshoreman strike, national disasters, and escalating global tensions, which could impact the upcoming election.  Dave Brat and Ralph Reed praised JD Vance’s debate performance, highlighting Vance as “one of the brightest” and “a gentleman” who effectively addressed key issues like the economy, inflation, and crime. Reed criticized Tim Ryan for defending a “failed administration” amidst crises such as missile attacks on Israel and border issues. Reed noted the mainstream media’s predictable attempts to shift focus to less relevant topics, like January 6th. Reed also provided an update on door-knocking efforts, with 417,214 doors reached in Pennsylvania and 4 million nationwide. He predicted Evangelical voters will turn out in record numbers, and Vance is poised to secure both the Evangelical and Catholic votes.  Grace Chong issued a rallying cry for the Warren Posse, urging members to engage actively in the upcoming elections by reaching out to 10 to 20 people daily in critical battleground states. She highlighted the importance of using the Early Vote Action and TP Action apps to facilitate calls, texts, and postcard campaigns for voter registration. Chong emphasized the urgency of this mission with just 34 days left until the election, calling on members to take personal responsibility and make a commitment to participate every day to ensure voter turnout and mobilize support effectively  Eric Teetsel, the new Executive Vice President of the Center for Renewing America, discussed his role and the organization’s goals with Dave Bratt. Teetsel emphasized that America has untapped potential and expressed hope for improvement. Reflecting on a recent debate, he described it as “the singular most dominant debate performance” and praised Senator Vance for his brilliance and readiness to lead, contrasting him with Mr. Waltz’s lackluster presentation. The discussion shifted to critical issues, including the economy, border security, and international relations. Teetsel noted, “For a long time now, we have made policy choices… that may work for a certain class of society,” indicating that average Americans have been neglected. He highlighted the importance of tariffs, specifically those proposed by President Trump, as tools for economic revitalization, stating, “We have to make different choices to prevent that from happening” regarding threats from China. Teetsel also called attention to the need for a paradigm shift in policies to better serve national interests and stressed that the fight against the "Deep State” remains crucial. He acknowledged the leadership of Russ Vought, noting his dedication and experience. Teetsel encouraged listeners to connect with the Center for Renewing America and mentioned his podcast, which takes a faith-based approach to current events.

Salleigh Grubbs highlighted growing momentum for Donald Trump, emphasizing high voter turnout in recent elections and record-breaking participation, particularly among lower-propensity Republican voters. Despite not having specific early voting data, Grubbs noted that feedback from poll watchers across Cobb County has been positive, suggesting strong Republican performance. Grubbs shifted focus to ongoing legal challenges in Georgia, mentioning over 85 cases against the Secretary of State. A significant case involves Eternal Vigilance Action, targeting seven rules passed by the Georgia State Election Board. A recent ruling by Judge Cox in Fulton County blocked these rules, potentially impacting the upcoming election. Grubbs emphasized the importance of these rules, specifically those related to ballot counting, which the opposition sought to eliminate. She stressed that the opposition claims to be Republican but acts against what she considers "common-sense” rules. In response, the Georgia GOP and the RNC filed an appeal, with Grubbs submitting a strong amicus brief. She expressed hope that the Supreme Court will issue an expedited, favorable ruling to ensure these election rules are reinstated. Grubbs called for persistence, urging supporters to continue the legal battle to secure fair election processes in Georgia.  Natalie Winters talked about her feelings about Liz Cheney.  Maureen Bannon discusses the details of the First Step Act request filed by her Dad’s legal team in August that was denied just recently. She repeats her story from yesterday about her frustrations over the Bureau of Prison’s denial. Steve Bannon is still scheduled to be released from prison on Oct. 29.  Jim Hoft gives updates on his stories about Overseas Voting, which is being fact-checked by the same organization that Natalie Winters is being fact-checked for, which she says she broke on the WarRoom program a couple of weeks ago, and they share those details.  Mike Davis repeats his story about President Trump’s need to start a criminal probe as soon as possible into the tactics and actions of the administrative state and the Intelligence community.  Ben Harnwell interviewed Michelle Morrow, who is running for office in North Carolina.  Erin Joyce discusses the election in Virginia and her observations on low-propensity voters there. She says it looks good for Trump and other down-ballot races.  Sabin Howard is a Populist Artist who has discussed the history of sculptures and art in the United States. He recently finished a long-term project on World War One. Howard has a unique philosophy about power in art and the need to return to the tenets of Western Civilization in culture and art.  Brandon Showalter and Ben Harnwell’s discussion focuses on the spiritual and moral battles they perceive in current events, both globally and in the U.S. Showalter highlights a “stark contrast between spiritual evil and good,” citing recent public displays he views as demonic, including a controversial event in Georgia and the 2024 Olympics in France, which he believes mocked Christian symbols. He references Biblical teachings on spiritual warfare, emphasizing the power of Christian prayer to combat such perceived evil. Harnwell adds context with a legal battle in Alabama. He explains that the state’s restrictions on gender-affirming treatments for minors have reached the Supreme Court. Alabama’s law, one of the strictest, criminalizes certain medical procedures for children, and the ensuing legal disputes have uncovered what Showalter describes as disturbing activism within influential health organizations, including allegations involving Rachel Levine at the Department of Health and Human Services. The discovery phase has revealed the involvement of prominent activists in shaping healthcare guidelines, further fueling the controversy. Both Showalter and Harnwell underscore the intensity of the moral and political conflicts, with a particular emphasis on prayer and legal measures as means to uphold their views of Christian values.

Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts and ideas about Election integrity topics and how Democrats have been responsible for imprisioning numerous supporters of President Trump.  Jim Womack talked about his Election Integrity fundraiser, some of the cases he follows and promotes media interest in, and the media coverage of elections.  Grace Chong read her article from the other day again and discussed Steve’s statement regarding the First Step Act.  She also encouraged the audience to write out postcards for Get Out The Vote efforts.  Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts and feelings about what she calls the Deep State and the Deep State Generals, and she says that they do not support the America First Agenda.  Colin Aamot talked about his frustration that the House Oversight Committee appears to be ignoring some documents that highlight the connections between the Democrat Vice President candidate and his association with the Chinese Communist Party.  Natalie Winters discussed her thoughts and feelings about how a managerial class must get rich by destroying the United States of America.  Darren Beattie talked about the various news organizations and their endorsements or lack of endorsements and said that he felt Joe Biden should endorse Donald Trump.  Karen Sidgemund highlighted the American Freedom Alliance’s recent initiatives, emphasizing efforts to raise awareness about critical security threats. She mentioned past events, including “World War III: The Early Years,” which began in Los Angeles with Steve Bannon’s support. These events have been ongoing, with the latest held in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and available on their Rumble channel due to YouTube’s restrictions. “YouTube can be quite finicky when you address actual reality,” she noted, pointing to censorship challenges. Sidgemund stressed the importance of informed voting, saying their aim is to combat misinformation and provide “true information about the threats” that America faces. Upcoming efforts will focus on disseminating concise video clips to reach broader audiences. According to her, the initiative is about preserving freedoms and protecting the constitutional republic, highlighting that “this is not about politics, it’s about policies.” She encouraged supporters to visit their website, AmericanFreedomAlliance.org, and follow their Rumble and social media platforms for the latest updates. Sidgemund’s mission is clear: to inform the public so they vote from an “informed perspective” rather than being misled by disinformation. Retired U.S. Navy Captain James Fanell, a former senior naval intelligence officer, shared his concerns regarding recent remarks by retired Generals John Kelly and Mark Milley about former President Trump. Fanell, co-author of “Embracing Communist China: America’s Greatest Strategic Failure,” emphasized the seriousness of their statements. He criticized these former military leaders, saying their public accusations, including references to Trump as a “fascist,” breach military ethics. According to Fanell, such behavior undermines the oath they took to defend the Constitution and the principle of civilian control over the military: "They should have formally resigned while they were in office,” if they had such concerns, he asserted. Fanell expressed disappointment with General Milley’s actions, labeling him “arrogant” and an “elitist,” especially given Milley’s lucrative post-retirement roles tied to defense firms. He contrasted this with the integrity shown by past military figures who maintained neutrality, such as George Marshall, who famously refrained from voting to preserve military professionalism. As the conversation transitioned to international concerns, Fanell noted the aggressive behavior of the People’s Republic of China, highlighting its strategic threats to U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region. He urged Americans to reflect on these global challenges when considering their choices in the upcoming election.  Colonel Derek Harvey examined escalating threats posed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and criticized the military leadership of figures like General Milley. Harvey emphasized that the current geopolitical climate is far worse than it was four years ago, stating, "We can say without a doubt that we’re worse off today.” He pointed out recent aggressive maneuvers by China, including the "joint sword 2024 Bravo” exercises, which involved 153 aircraft sorties aimed at testing a blockade of Taiwan. He noted that on one day, China conducted 140 sorties, a significant increase from previous years. "This is a dangerous time,” he warned, highlighting the growing threats in the South China Sea and China’s harassment of Indonesian operations. Colonel Harvey expressed disappointment in military leaders like Milley, stating, "Generals like Milley and Kelly have not been focused on winning.” He criticized them for their political ties, claiming their actions have been influenced by the "authoritarian left.” Harvey warned that the real threats stem from the "weaponization of the DOJ and the FBI,” which he deemed a form of fascism. Furthermore, he expressed concern over Israel’s trust in the U.S. amid rising tensions with Iran. "The United States cannot be trusted by Israel,” he asserted, citing systemic issues within the current administration that view Iran favorably while regarding Israel as the problem. Harvey’s insights underscore the complex interplay of global threats and military leadership inadequacies.

Gavin Wax and Steve Bannon discussed the Trump campaign’s momentum and New York City’s strategic role in the 2024 election. Wax observed a noticeable lack of energy from the left in NYC, describing a "defeatism going through the ranks” compared to past years of vocal opposition, which he sees as a shift in favor of the populist right. Wax and Bannon believe Trump’s focus on winning over diverse, working-class demographics—including Black and Hispanic voters—is resonating well, especially with his New York energy and style. Wax notes that Trump’s appeal goes beyond policy, connecting with low-propensity voters who have felt overlooked by traditional GOP outreach. Highlighting the New York Young Republicans Club’s role in these efforts, Wax shared their extensive grassroots activities, like door-knocking and phone banking across NYC and swing counties, which he believes are vital to expanding populism’s influence. The conversation concluded with excitement about their upcoming gala, which Wax called "the event of the year,” aiming to celebrate populism and build support for the ongoing political movement. TICKETS  Eric Metaxas, with Steve Bannon, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the media’s hostile treatment of Bannon. Metaxas shared his shock at the overt disdain journalists showed, stating, “The level of hostility was utterly despicable.” He described the media as “pampered perfumed fools,” noting they acted more like “the information Warfare Department of the political class” rather than impartial truth-seekers. Bannon and Metaxas agreed that mainstream journalists no longer seek objectivity, calling it a display of contempt for Americans and “team reality.” Bannon remarked that such media hostility reflects the broader, combative state of American politics, which he labeled a "blood sport.” Metaxas, a Yale classmate of Wolf’s, noted his disillusionment, saying he avoids journalists as they "disgust [him] so profoundly.” Despite this, he observed the experience was “horrifying” and emblematic of the societal divide, as he, Bannon, and Wolf—former ideological opposites—have united in pursuit of “what is real and what is true.”  Steve Bannon and Naomi Wolf explored populist themes, personal freedoms, and political unity, challenging the usual labels applied to populist movements. Bannon argued that populism represents a diverse America, with people across races and religions engaging, despite attempts to label these gatherings as “fascist.” Wolf, recalling her own experience, said Bannon’s platform allowed her to warn the public about potential health risks associated with the mRNA vaccine, despite censorship she faced. "Instead of helping women protect their fertility, they lifted [my warnings] out to silence me,” she said, adding that Bannon’s audience provided essential support. Wolf praised Trump for building what she described as a “unity party,” aligning with figures like RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Elon Musk, emphasizing that Trump’s coalition now speaks to concerns across demographics: “black people, white people, Hispanic people, women, men.” She also acknowledged Bannon’s role in producing the “Pfizer Papers,” a report revealing alleged vaccine harms, which Wolf says was key in sharing information the government wanted hidden. Bannon emphasized the importance of grassroots support, particularly as November approaches, with projects like Daily Clout providing tools for voter transparency. He also mentioned that Wolf’s work has become integral to his campaign, even accessible to inmates at his correctional facility. Wolf urged continued support, highlighting the role of platforms like War Room in "moving the needle.”  Natalie Winters summarized Steve Bannon’s Press conference earlier on Tuesday.  You can read our coverage of that press conference:  Bannon’s Out, and He’s Not Backing Down: "Dems are Going to Fight Dirty and MAGA Won’t be Silenced”   Monica Crowley talked about the loss of hope in the Population after seeing the Biden-Harris administration in action and said that she believed more and more people were discovering that they saw renewed hope for their situation in President Trump.

Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters examined election-related tensions in Pennsylvania, describing what they called the "chaos” surrounding the 2024 election. Posobiec noted that Trump and his supporters are frustrated by alleged tactics to restrict Republican poll watchers and create complications with mail-in voting. Bannon highlighted a claim by Bill McGinley, a senior election lawyer, who said Republicans are countering issues with mail-in ballots by encouraging voters to hand-deliver ballots to ensure receipt. Winters emphasized that election officials, notably influenced by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), have implemented "election security measures,” which critics argue limit transparency, such as covering windows to obstruct poll watcher views. Posobiec linked these measures to a broader "narrative programming” approach, suggesting that federal and state entities, including the FBI, might be preparing narratives to counter election fraud claims by branding them as foreign disinformation. Bannon and winters argued that this approach serves to delegitimize Republican poll watchers and prime the public for potential delays and security measures that, they believe, primarily restrict MAGA observers. Posobiec also referenced recent issues in Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Michigan, pointing out election software concerns and incidents that he sees as undermining transparency. Bannon suggested these actions represent a fifth-dimensional information warfare against MAGA voters, implying a deep-seated bias in election oversight. Reflecting on this landscape, they urged voters in Pennsylvania to remain vigilant, especially after legal battles in areas like Bucks County led to an extension of voting hours.  Nikki Jam, a renowned musician of Puerto Rican descent, has withdrawn his endorsement of Donald Trump following controversial comments about Puerto Rico made by a comedian at a Trump rally. Despite Trump’s campaign trying to distance itself from these remarks, the incident has led to significant backlash. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a supporter of Trump and of Puerto Rican descent herself, defends Trump, emphasizing that he did not make the offensive remarks and has consistently shown support for the Latino and Hispanic communities. She argues that while the situation is unfortunate, it should not overshadow Trump’s overall record and relationship with these communities. Guilfoyle suggests Trump should continue focusing on his support for these groups and possibly visit Puerto Rico to reaffirm his commitment. She also touches on the broader implications for the election, stressing the importance of voter integrity and the need for Trump to concentrate on battleground states in the final days of the campaign.  Jack Posobiec discussed recent issues regarding alleged election law violations in Pennsylvania, specifically Bucks County, where he claims that officials attempted to shut down voting processes in ways he argues are against the law. He recounted spending time gathering affidavits and videos with lawyers and witnesses to document these instances for a legal challenge. According to Posobiec, a judge ultimately rejected these alleged attempts to limit voting, stating that such actions violated election law. He also pointed out that Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and other Democratic officials have not addressed these claims directly, instead labeling them as "misinformation.” Posobiec encouraged others to document similar occurrences nationwide, asserting that these efforts could replicate the approach taken in Bucks County to monitor and address potential issues in other states as well. He underscored Pennsylvania and Arizona as critical states for ensuring voting transparency in the upcoming election.  Natalie Winters talked about the rising esclations from the Democrats and their tactics to try to win the election.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon got into the economic and political challenges facing the United States. Patrick highlighted concerns about inflation, fiscal policies, and the rising national debt, emphasizing how these factors have placed economic strain on middle-class Americans. He pointed to government spending and Federal Reserve policies as major contributors to inflationary pressures and discussed the potential long-term effects on the economy and U.S. dollar. Bannon, focusing on political dynamics, echoed Patrick’s concerns, arguing that fiscal irresponsibility undermines the nation’s stability. He criticized policymakers for failing to address core economic issues, attributing this inaction to a lack of political will and accountability. Bannon also stressed the importance of economic nationalism, advocating for policies that prioritize American industries and reduce reliance on foreign economies. Both agreed on the need for reform, with Bannon framing the conversation within the broader America First agenda, calling for a grassroots movement to challenge the political establishment. Their discussion painted a picture of urgency, with a shared belief that without significant economic and political change, the U.S. could face deeper systemic issues in the future.  Tyler Bwoyer from Turning Point USA Action shared with Steve Bannon their aggressive voter mobilization efforts in Arizona. Boyer described their work as “kicking butt,” with volunteers working "from sunup to sundown” to reach low-propensity and disengaged Republican voters. Through the “Commit 100” initiative, they aim to turn out voters who haven’t consistently participated in past elections, targeting those identified as likely conservatives. Bowyer explained, "We’ve mobilized folks to chase 100 of the most necessary ballots,” using personalized, community-based approaches similar to Democratic strategies under Obama. Bannon highlighted the importance of this groundwork, especially in early voting, to avoid "cannibalizing” Election Day turnout. Bowyer reassured him, stating, "We’re seeing dramatic results,” adding that Arizona’s high number of mail-in voters aids their tracking of engagement. Both expressed optimism, with Bowyer noting this week as pivotal: "We’re on a good trajectory to turn out the people we need to win.” In closing, Bannon underscored the value of alternative media for informing voters, as mainstream sources often overlook these local mobilization efforts.

Steve Bannon’s recent remarks highlight the War Room’s intense focus on mobilizing voters for upcoming elections, aiming to secure a major victory for the MAGA movement. Positioned in Washington, D.C., near the Capitol, Bannon described the movement’s current state as a battle between grassroots mobilization and established opposition. He criticized what he sees as "delegitimization” efforts reminiscent of tactics used against Trump in 2016 and emphasized the need for supporters to rally in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona to help ensure voting integrity. Bannon called for "mass mobilization” efforts, outlining plans for comprehensive coverage by his team, including appearances from figures like Peter Navarro, Natalie Winters, and Charlie Kirk. He expressed confidence in winning if supporters stay vigilant, particularly with early voting. Stressing the stakes, he compared the current fight to a “match play” contest in golf, where victory hinges on reaching the electoral threshold of 270 votes. This approach, he noted, aligns with the Founding Fathers’ vision of the U.S. as a constitutional republic rather than a simple democracy. Bannon explained that the War Room’s strategy relies on grassroots activism rather than large monetary contributions or media campaigns. He emphasized the role of Christian voters and encouraged faith-based communities to view participation as a moral duty, framing this moment as a "spiritual war.” In Bannon’s view, the stakes are existential, calling for steadfast dedication to the cause to secure a political win and a reclamation of cultural values. The push, he added, is merely the beginning of a larger process in the ongoing populist movement.  Dave Brat’s remarks emphasize the crucial role of mobilizing Christian voters in key states to secure electoral victories. He believes that a strong Christian turnout could tip the scales in places like Arizona and Virginia, aligning with a “match play” strategy to win targeted electoral votes rather than a broad sweep. Brat urges Christian communities to organize by reaching out to their congregational lists, encouraging pastors to send voting reminders, and focusing on economic concerns, the border situation, and religious values. By leveraging grassroots efforts similar to those he used in his own campaign, Brat contends that an active, unified Christian electorate could bring about decisive results. “If we all do that, 100 million folks show up, and it’s game over,” he says, calling for a concerted effort among traditional Christian voters to show up and vote for their values.  Steve Bannon and Scott Presler underscore the urgent push for Republican voter mobilization in key areas, especially Pennsylvania. Bannon lauds Presler as the “Johnny Appleseed” of grassroots voter engagement, crediting him with tireless dedication. Presler highlights efforts in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where Republican turnout is surging and Democrat voter registration is dwindling. He notes that Democrats had “voter protection” groups aimed at limiting Republican voting, leading to an extended early voting period due to a court ruling. The numbers are promising: the Democrat lead of 1.1 million voters in 2020 is now down to 387,000, a significant shift. Presler emphasizes, “We have every metric going in our direction,” but warns against complacency. He stresses the need for outreach across demographics—veterans, hunters, young men and women—and encourages engaging voters at everyday locations like gas stations and supermarkets to ensure everyone has a voting plan. Bannon and Presler both emphasize that this level of mobilization is crucial to victory, with Presler adding, "You vote like your very lives depend on winning this November.” Bannon observes a visible enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans, attributing it to an uncharismatic Democrat candidate. He encourages continued community organizing, asserting, "This is a time to unite black, white, brown, blue-collar… that’s the new populist.” Presler and Bannon’s unified message is clear: relentless grassroots engagement is essential to secure a decisive turnout on Election Day.  Steve Bannon and Breitbart’s Matt Boyle are marking a historic shift as Republicans lead early voting in battleground states like Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada—traditionally Democratic strongholds. For the first time, GOP early voting is up, thanks to outreach efforts that are successfully drawing in "low-propensity” voters who are less likely to withstand long Election Day lines. The GOP’s targeted early turnout in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin is crucial, as flipping even one of these states could pave Trump’s path to victory. Early voting numbers in Pennsylvania show potential Democratic vulnerability, with the GOP gaining ground in traditionally blue regions, aided by a legal win that preserved early voting in Bucks County. Boyle highlights that this surge is largely due to grassroots mobilization by alternative media, social platforms, and influencers like Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk, who have driven a powerful GOTV (Get Out the Vote) effort to rally men and other key demographics to vote early. As Boyle and Bannon emphasize, the GOP’s plan to beat Democrats at their own game of early mobilization has worked, but they urge Republicans to push hard through Election Day, particularly focusing on male voter turnout to cement their gains.   Natalie Winters discussed the importance of election officials counting only the ballots of certifiable legal votes and bypassing illegal votes.  Mike Benz exposes the tactics of censoring the social media posts of Conservatives.  Darren Beattie discusses his coverage on Revolver News of Jamie Raskin objecting to President Trump’s victory after the votes are counted.  Rudy Giuliani passionately emphasized the importance of mobilizing efforts for the upcoming election, urging Americans to stay vigilant and proactive. Reflecting on past elections, Giuliani warned of potential threats, stating, "They tried everything,” referring to alleged attempts to disqualify candidates and influence outcomes. He voiced concerns about extreme actions, cautioning that "they may try to kill you,” while adding, "I wouldn’t exclude that possibility,” drawing on his experience as an investigator. Giuliani advised supporters to get involved by volunteering for the party and organizations like Turning Point, emphasizing that greater turnout and oversight could help secure election integrity. He noted, "The more people we can turn out for inspections, the more frightened they get.” Giuliani encouraged the public to stay engaged, adding, "Don’t sit back; there’s something you can do,” stressing active participation on the days leading up to Election Day.

Steve Bannon and Chris Buskirk discussed turnout efforts in the upcoming election, focusing on mobilizing low and mid-propensity voters who already support Donald Trump but may not have a strong voting history. Their campaign strategy relies on new FEC rules that allow outside groups, like Turnout for America, to collaborate with campaign data, enabling a targeted approach without duplication of effort. This is seen as a game-changer, especially given limited resources. Buskirk explained that their strategy is data-driven, using information on voters’ prior turnout behavior to pinpoint and engage potential supporters. So far, this has proven effective in swing states, with early voting participation reportedly surpassing 2016 and 2020 rates among Trump supporters. Additionally, Bannon and Buskirk contrasted their approach with the Democrats’, who are also trying to mobilize their base but appear to lack enthusiasm among their low-propensity voters. Buskirk emphasized that their success hinges on grassroots efforts and adapting to early voting, a shift from prior GOP habits. The overall message was that this new approach is making a measurable impact on voter engagement, which they believe is crucial to achieving victory  Natalie Winters talked about her investigation into the connections between the Arizona Secretary of State and the person she calls the Colour Revolution Architect.  In this conversation, Caroline Wren and Steve Bannon discuss the high voter turnout among Republicans in Arizona, where GOP early voting has taken a significant lead. Wren attributes this surge to discontent with current administration policies and to grassroots organizing led by Bannon’s "War Room Posse.” She highlights that these efforts have activated local GOP chapters, especially in Arizona, driving a strong turnout. Wren and Bannon then discuss Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake’s polling lead over her Democratic opponents, contrasting this with the lack of support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. They also cover a recent legal development concerning unverified voters in Arizona: a court ruling mandated the release of information on nearly 289,000 voters whose citizenship status was unconfirmed. However, despite America First Legal’s legal victory, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled these individuals cannot be removed from voting rolls. Concerns over potential voter suppression due to long wait times at mass voting centers in Maricopa County were raised, with Wren advising voters to stay in line to ensure their votes are counted.  Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon addressed the economic struggles faced by working-class Americans, citing inflation, rising credit card debt, and high-interest rates. According to Navarro, middle and lower-income Americans are burdened by steep credit card APRs, which reach up to 29%, forcing them into debt for basic necessities. The cost of living is rising, especially with essentials like food and housing, and people are increasingly using credit cards just to get by. Navarro noted that many are “choosing between food on the table and medicine in the cabinet,” and inflation only compounds these issues. They attribute much of this economic stress to what they call “politician error,” arguing that Federal Reserve policies and high interest rates are worsening inflation and mortgage costs. Bannon pointed out that when Trump left office, the ten-year treasury rate was under 1%, but it has since risen, affecting loan rates and economic stability. The two argue that these economic challenges have led working-class Americans to support Trump’s policies, believing his tenure offered better conditions, including tariffs on steel and aluminum to protect U.S. industries. Navarro cited Trump’s actions as beneficial for American manufacturing and job security, especially in areas like Pennsylvania, where industries benefited from protective tariffs. Navarro urged voters to show up in large numbers in the next election to ensure the outcomes reflect public sentiment, emphasizing Trump’s “100 actions in 100 days” if re-elected.  In a conversation with Steve Bannon, Sigal Chattah emphasized the significant strides Republicans have made in Nevada, describing efforts to dismantle the longstanding Democratic "Harry Reid machine” and indicating a promising lead in Republican votes. She highlighted a current 40,000 Republican vote advantage, noting that this lead surpasses Trump’s 2020 loss margin in the state, suggesting potential for a Trump victory in 2024. Chattah discussed extensive ballot-harvesting strategies, including creative initiatives like using Halloween gatherings as opportunities for ballot collection. She explained that early voting was still underway, and efforts to "bank ballots” would continue through Election Day, enabled by Nevada’s 2020 decision to decriminalize ballot harvesting. Bannon praised Chattah and her team’s mobilization and commended their commitment to converting Nevada for Trump. They briefly discussed media attention on Chattah as a potential attorney general pick and the strategy to prioritize securing both the presidency and Congress. Bannon also encouraged followers to stay updated on Chattah’s efforts through her social media. Chattah expressed confidence in delivering Nevada to Trump, citing support from various groups and a well-coordinated ballot-chasing operation.  Natalie Winters talked about how the admin state and the corporate media are pushing for an amendment to the US Constutition in order to stop President Trump from returning to the White House.  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Jeff Clark discuss the legal and political complexities surrounding efforts to prevent Donald Trump from assuming office if re-elected, focusing on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars those who engaged in insurrection from holding office. They highlight a recent Supreme Court decision in Colorado rejecting attempts to remove Trump from the ballot. Clark explains that the justices upheld Trump’s eligibility because barring a presidential candidate in one state could lead to chaos, resulting in inconsistent ballots across states. However, Clark notes that while the ruling was unanimous in Trump’s favor on this basis, the justices were split on broader questions, such as the enforceability of Section 3 and whether a new statute is needed to apply it. Bannon and Clark speculate on Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin’s possible maneuvers, particularly his suggestion that Congress might refuse to certify Trump’s presidency on January 6, 2025, if he is labeled an insurrectionist. This, they argue, could trigger an emergency Supreme Court case. Clark is concerned about potential further indictments from Special Counsel Jack Smith and how these might be leveraged in January if Democrats, led by Hakeem Jeffries in the House, attempt to block Trump. Clark also raises concerns about potential abuses in the voting process, particularly through the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which he claims could be exploited due to lenient residency requirements. Both Bannon and Clark underscore the significance of these legal strategies, arguing that figures like Mark Elias and Raskin are determined to prevent Trump from regaining power through judicial and legislative tactics.  Part Two:  Grace Chong commends the resilience and dedication of the WarRoom audience, supporters who rallied together following the incarceration of Steve Bannon. She describes his imprisonment as a "blessing in disguise,” igniting a sense of urgency and action among the group. Chong encourages continued participation, particularly in support of Joe Kent’s congressional race in Washington’s third district, emphasizing the importance of sending postcards and verifying ballot statuses due to potential issues with mail-in ballots. The recent fire in Clark County, which may have compromised hundreds of ballots, highlights the need for voters to ensure their ballots are accepted. Chong praises JoJo, a key leader in the effort, as well as the team members who kept operations running smoothly. As early voting comes to a close, she underscores the importance of persistence and determination, anticipating potential challenges at the polls. She stresses the need for unity and readiness, urging supporters to press forward through Election Day to achieve victory, which can then be leveraged by allies like Boris Epstein, Jeff Clark, Bill McGinley, and Mike Davis in ongoing efforts.

Steve Kenny, Senior Litigation Counsel at the Republican National Committee (RNC), is central to defending and challenging election laws. Davis notes that Kenny has been pivotal in legal victories, describing him as “the secret weapon” behind Senate Judiciary Committee successes in confirming President Trump’s judges during Davis’ tenure as Chief Counsel. Kenny explains that the RNC is engaged in “the most active litigation docket of any cycle in history,” handling 126 cases across 26 states. Their efforts focus on two main strategies: defending existing election laws from left-wing challenges and proactively filing lawsuits when state officials violate election laws. This shift toward proactive litigation is largely due to the leadership of President Trump and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley. Kenny emphasizes that many Democratic officials refuse to defend election integrity laws, leaving the RNC to step in. He also highlights successes in states like Pennsylvania, where the RNC has defended the requirement for absentee ballots to be signed and dated, calling it a critical tool in preventing voter fraud. He mentions a case where a fraudulent ballot from a deceased voter was detected due to the date requirement, explaining, “It performs a very important voter integrity function.” Election Integrity Battles in Swing States:
Kenny provides updates on key swing states: Pennsylvania: The RNC successfully defended the ballot dating requirement multiple times, and Kenny expects the issue to resurface in upcoming litigation. Michigan: The RNC won against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s attempts to introduce secret instructions that would presume the validity of absentee ballot signatures. Kenny says, “This violates the Michigan Constitution, which requires neutral verification.” Wisconsin: The RNC challenged a policy allowing voters to re-vote by spoiling absentee ballots. They also won lawsuits ensuring Republican representation in nursing homes and poll watcher access. North Carolina: Recent victories include blocking digital student IDs as valid voter IDs and challenging overseas voter regulations that allow individuals who never lived in the state to vote. Georgia: The state has seen the RNC defend several provisions of Senate Bill 202, an election integrity law passed after the 2020 election. Kenny notes, “Nearly all of that law will be in effect for this November.” Arizona: The RNC successfully defended citizenship verification requirements and continues to fight for documentary proof of citizenship in voter registrations. Kenny believes many of these cases will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. Kenny concludes by outlining ongoing legal battles in Nevada, emphasizing that these efforts aim to secure fair elections and ensure that election integrity laws are upheld across the nation.  Maureen Bannon talked about the various voter registration deadlines in various states, and also about the Get Out The Vote Efforts that are necessary to win the ground game for President Trump.  In a discussion between Mike Davis and Mark Lucas from the Article 3 Project, the conversation focuses on preventing non-citizens from voting in key battleground states ahead of the 2024 election. Lucas emphasized that non-citizen voting is a central tactic the left may employ, with Elon Musk highlighting the rising number of illegal migrants. He encouraged War Room listeners to take action through A3P’s website by contacting election officials responsible for verifying citizenship. Lucas pointed out Arizona, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as critical states, with issues like non-citizens possessing driver’s licenses or state IDs. “We know that non-citizens are illegally voting in past elections,” said Lucas, citing examples from Virginia and Texas. He stressed the need for legislation like the “Save American Elections Act” to combat this threat, concluding with a call for the War Room audience to engage in efforts to safeguard the election process.  In this discussion between Mike Davis and Jeff Clark, they reacted to an article by Eli Honig in New York Magazine that criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith and Judge Tanya Chutkan for their handling of Donald Trump’s legal case following the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity. Jeff Clark noted that the original title of the article, “Jack Smith’s October Surprise,” was changed to “Jack Smith’s October Cheap Shot.” He emphasized that Honig, a former prosecutor and frequent critic of Trump, acknowledged Smith’s disregard for legal norms, saying Smith had “abandoned all objectivity” and shredded the Justice Department’s manual, violating Trump’s due process rights. Clark echoed these concerns, describing Smith’s actions as unconstitutional and designed to interfere with the 2024 election by releasing unexamined evidence against Trump. Davis added that this behavior amounts to “jury pool tampering” and “electoral pool tampering.” They discussed how a future Trump administration should reform the Justice Department, including firing Jack Smith and FBI Director Chris Wray, and ensuring that the department focuses on real crime rather than pursuing January 6th participants. Clark highlighted the need to align the DOJ’s role with the president’s authority, in line with constitutional principles.  Natalie Winters highlighted a recent DOD memo that had made changes in definitions about Assassinations.  Lee Smith talked about a recent article of his titled The FBI Entraps Another Fake Assassin and spoke about other groups who are elevating the theory that the men who tried to assassinate President Trump are fake.  Natalie Winters criticizes the response to Hurricane and the Biden-Harris administration’s approach to the suffering of people impacted as being like a Death to America chant.  Kari Bailey-Chapman talked about her concerns that the EV regulations of the Biden and Harris administrations and by the Democrats in general were actually to ban the combustion engine and how their regulations could actually favor governments and groups who are far less eco-friendly than the United States.  Natalie Winters questioned why Deoocart voting groups were not concerned about the voting problems in areas that are damaged by Hurricane Helene last week.  Natalie Winters talked about her continuing theme of why she is frustrated with Republicans and why she believes Republicans do not want President Trump to win the 2024 Presidential election, and she talked about her anger with Speaker Mike Johnson.

Natalie Winters referred to some corporate media reports and their claims that illegals don’t vote.  State Sen. Jake Hoffman talked about what he has seen in his district with Democrats trying to flip the state “blue” to their side and using illegal aliens to vote to help that happen.  Natalie Winters reacts critically to a clip of Andy Weissmann.  Jason Goodman discussed his appearance during the discussion with Andy Weissman (above) and his point of view on what Lawfare is and how it currently impacts politics.  Noor Bin Ladin discussed her experiences with NATO and her theories about the organization’s purpose as a military arm to enforce Globalism.  In a discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell from Rasmussen Reports, they examined the significance of betting markets, particularly PolyMarket, in gauging public perception of the 2024 presidential election. Harnwell noted that Trump’s support has surged in recent betting, leading him by a substantial margin, reflecting public belief that he will win. Mitchell emphasized that while betting markets can fluctuate, polling data is still more reliable. “Polling is more accurate,” Mitchell said, referencing recent Rasmussen data that showed Trump leading by two points in the national popular vote. Mitchell also pointed out that despite left-leaning media narratives, Trump’s lead is becoming undeniable. “At some point, people on the left… are going to have to wake up to the cognitive dissonance,” he stated. He criticized the mainstream media for being slow to report Trump’s gains, suggesting that polling bias might influence their narrative. According to Mitchell, Trump will likely win key swing states like Pennsylvania, with recent data reflecting a growing advantage. Both emphasized that betting markets and polling are converging on the reality that Trump is favored, despite media reluctance to acknowledge it.  Dave Walsh recently discussed Florida’s energy infrastructure, focusing on the challenges posed by the state’s increasing reliance on solar power. He praised linemen working tirelessly to restore power during storms but highlighted flaws in Florida’s energy strategy. According to Walsh, utilities like Duke Energy and FPL are investing billions in solar farms while neglecting reliable energy sources such as gas, nuclear, and coal. "No new gas-fire, combined cycle plants, no new nuclear plants,” Walsh emphasized, criticizing the closure of coal plants and the lack of investment in dependable baseload power. Walsh pointed out that despite massive solar installations, fossil fuel use has increased. "Duke Energy’s fossil fuel utilization is up two percent,” he noted, revealing solar power’s inefficiency in replacing traditional energy sources. Additionally, Walsh expressed concern over the fragmented nature of solar infrastructure, making it harder to maintain during severe weather events like the recent Category 5 hurricane. He also noted that industries dependent on continuous electricity, such as paper mills and steel plants, are ill-served by intermittent solar and wind power. “Solar and wind cannot be the nation’s sole energy source,” Walsh concluded, calling for a shift back to more reliable, continuous power generation methods.   Jim Womack has one of numerous election integrity groups in North Carolina who are concerned about the impact that the damage in Western North Carolina will have on the November election, and he is asking for donations to his group.  Brian Schimming, Chair of the GOP in Wisconsin, praised the recent rally held by Donald Trump in Dodge County, describing the event as highly successful. Schimming noted, “We had well over ten thousand people” in attendance, emphasizing the strong energy and enthusiasm. He observed that the crowd’s intensity felt as though “the election is two days away,” highlighting the excitement for the upcoming election. Schimming shared that people began lining up hours before the rally, with many arriving as early as 6 a.m., showing immense dedication. “There were thousands of cars parked around that airport,” he said, underscoring the scale of the event. One of the key messages from the rally was the importance of early voting. “The biggest banner… was ‘vote early,'” Schimming said, refuting claims that Trump isn’t serious about early voting. Trump stressed the need for early participation, noting that early voting in Wisconsin starts on October 22. Schimming also discussed the economic concerns resonating with Wisconsin voters, tying them to the broader dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration. He remarked, “Kamala Harris has to run away from Joe Biden,” reflecting voter frustration over issues such as the economy, Afghanistan, and the border crisis.  Cliff Mahoney highlighted the extensive efforts underway in Pennsylvania to secure victory in the upcoming election, emphasizing a door-knocking campaign aimed at reaching 500,000 doors. "We’ve nearly hit 200,0
