Founding Father John Adams wrote that "facts are stubborn things.”  Armed with facts, it is essential to correct the record regardingFinancial Timesjournalist Demetri Sevastopulo’s 31 January published interview with Biden administration’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.  Sullivan attempts to explain away the Biden administration’s failures, but the stubborn facts of the disastrous Biden national security policy cannot be ignored.  I focus on five of the most salient Sullivan made in the interview.
First, the "new Washington consensus” touted by Sullivan as a boon for the American middle class is anything but an aid to them.  It was Biden’s effort to continue the failed globalist approach of engagement with the PRC.  That is, foolishly believing that engaging with Beijing would change its behavior.  Biden continued engagement under the name "new Washington consensus,” whereby U.S. continued its support for the economy of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and thus the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the existential foe of the U.S.  The "new Washington consensus” remains centered on rewarding globalism at the expense of the American economy and workforce and so continues to undermine the American middle and working classes.  These policies, it must be noted, enriched the Biden family, as Chairman James Comer’s investigation has revealed.  In fact, only the first Trump administration reversed course to augment the security of the United States.  In contrast to what Sullivan contends, a full-scale decoupling would be devastating for the CCP at a time when they are supremely vulnerable.
Second, Sullivan notes that he was "taken by complete surprise” at Biden’s obvious and dangerous mental decline, stating that "it was not at all consistent with my experience.”   The Biden administration inflicted one of the greatest national security risks in the history of the U.S.  Adversaries in Moscow and Beijing took advantage of a weak and enfeebled president.  This demands accountability regarding who was in control of the U.S. government.  The families of the 13 U.S. servicemembers killed in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan deserve an answer.
Third, Sullivan relates that he is proud that he created a situation where "the core engines of American power are humming.”  In fact, the Biden administration did what it could to weaken those "core engines,” by continuing to make the PRC stronger through trade and investment in the PRC, not halting intellectual property theft and cyber attacks most recently against the U.S. Treasury and "Salt Typhoon,” perhaps the most damaging cyber penetration in U.S. history.  Moreover, DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley and the U.S. national security community by revealing a Sputnik Moment.  DeepSeek shows that Biden administration was asleep while the PRC was making great progress in Artificial Intelligence, the key technology of the 21stCentury.
Fourth, Sullivan touts the Biden’s administration’s China policy, claiming that the U.S. is in a "better position in the long-range competition with China than we were.”  In fact, the Biden administration weakened support for our partners like Taiwan and allies like the Republic of the Philippines that faces the PRC’s aggression at Sabina Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal, and elsewhere.  In 2023, Biden cancelled a trip to Australia to address the Australian Parliament, where he would also have met Indian Prime Minister Modi, for reasons that were never fully explained, and to the great embarrassment of our Australian allies.  Also in 2023, the PRC’s spy balloon floated over U.S. soil for many days, reportedly changing course indicating it was under control.  But Sullivan implies that it was not.  Additionally, Sullivan himself stated that the PRC is "undertaking the largest peacetime military build-up in human history.”  Indeed, during Biden’s presidency, two commanders of U.S. Strategic Command have noted that the PRC’s nuclear expansion has been "breathtaking.”   Yet, Biden’s response was not to redouble U.S. conventional and military might, but to continue to engage with the PRC, which actually funds the PRC’s military expansion and sustains the CCP’s tyranny.
Furthermore, the PRC’s leader Xi Jinping encouraged Putin to invade Ukraine and has offered, at a minimum, economic and diplomatic support to sustain Russia’s war while Xi labors to solidifying a bloc of the PRC, Russia, North Korea, and Iran to threaten U.S. interests.  At the same time, Xi is committing gross human rights abuse throughout the PRC, including genocide against the Muslim peoples of Xinjiang.
Fifth, Sullivan’s remarks on Ukraine centered on what the Trump administration should do rather than how the Biden administration failed to deter the aggression or to pressure the PRC to end its support for Moscow.  On Iran, Sullivan views it as the weakest now that it has been since 1988.  This is at a time when there are reports it is a half-step from having nuclear weapons.  Sullivan’s discussion of Gaza underplays the great pressure Biden placed on Israeli leader Netanyahu, which hindered Israel’s response to the great threats it faces in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and against the Houthis in Yemen.
Tellingly, two of the most acute national security threats, Biden’s open border and the fentanyl epidemic, were not mentioned in the interview.
The Biden administration was the worst in U.S. history.  The interview is a paltering exercise.  Sullivan can attempt to elide and dissemble the empirical record of the Biden administration, but the facts are stubborn things and cannot be ignored.  Accountability is needed for the strategic errors of the Biden administration.  Under the leadership of President Trump, the U.S. is correcting Biden’s terrible mistakes through policies based on "peace through strength” for the benefit of the American people and U.S. national security.

According to a House Judiciary Committee letter, in 2023, Mark Pomerantz, a former Manhattan prosecutor who was working underneath DA Alvin Bragg, and who led investigations into Donald Trump’s finances and stirred up a huge controversy when he stomped off in a huff and resigned, faced questioning over his actions by the House Judiciary Committee, led then by US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). And his bizarre behavior and reaction to being questioned about his anti-Trump demands are re-merging this week, threatening to take down the dreams of Trump’s opponents like a fragile house of cards. The WarRoom is front and center on this issue and deconstructs how we got here and where this might be headed. On Thursday, the same Judiciary committee, led by Jordan, officially and finally released the footage of the 2023 Jordan meeting with Pomerantz. So, the released 2023 footage is cited in a Thursday report, along with a link to a 300-page interim report that was released last week. WarRoom, which has focused on this report for days, reported on the huge interim report at the time of its release, titled AN ANATOMY OF A POLITICAL PROSECUTION: THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE’S VENDETTA AGAINST PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. Now, something is happening. According to US Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FLA), Pomerantz chose, in 2023, to plead the Fifth Amendment to almost every question that was posed to him during the Judiciary interview, raising concerns then about the potential future dismissal of cases against Trump. Those questions and answers are coming up again during the same time a multipronged campaign, led by Steve Bannon and the WarRoom,is demanding a broader probe by the entire US House into a potential criminal conspiracy against President Trump. KEY POINT ON POMERANTZ ISSUE: In 2023, Pomerantz participated in numerous high-profile media interviews in the context of his tell-all book on Trump, which was really a temper tantrum where he criticized Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg for not pursuing charges against Trump quickly enough and on Pomerantz’s timing. Pomerantz’s book, “People versus Donald Trump,” alleges that Trump committed financial crimes and should have been prosecuted more extensively- so quit his job, pouted off, wrote a book and did interviews to spread his message that Trump needed to be prosecuted and Bragg wasn’t going fast enough for him. Then he was hauled into DC and asked about all of this, but he refused to answer because he would incriminate himself. SO! Pomerantz’s decision to plead the Fifth raises questions about the strength of the cases against Trump and potential violations of legal ethics statutes during his time at the Manhattan DA’s office. At the time, in 2023, Gaetz talked about this question of whether his actions would derail the whole Trump case openly.  In a video then, Gaetz said that he believed that there is was subject matter waiver of Pomerantz’s Fifth Amendment rights; he hints at the possibility of compelling him to respond through a court order. Therefore- It is not new information that Gaetz interrogated Pomerantz. Still, it is noteworthy that Gaetz posted footage of Pomperantz taking the fifth in 2023 on Thursday amidst a week and a half of the consistent torrent of political moves by numerous US House members to finally fight back against President Donald J. Trump’s lawfare. This appears to slowly be building Bannon’s case that a serious investigation into a potential criminal conspiracy against Trump and others is warranted. And it shows that Bannon is right to suspect that someone is to blame for Republicans not being more organized and on the offense to help Trump. On Thursday, Gaetz’s  X post caught the attention of Steve Bannon: “Trump Prosecutor PLEADS FIFTH when asked if he BROKE THE LAW investigating Trump!” Gaetz posted on X. NEW VIDEO: Trump Prosecutor PLEADS FIFTH when asked if he BROKE THE LAW investigating Trump! pic.twitter.com/enDGztIhtD — Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) May 2, 2024  Bannon played the shocking footage of Pomerantz repeatedly taking the fifth as a cold open and briefly addressed the Gaetz post on his morning WarRoom program. Later, Mike Davis sounded off about the afternoon program with Natalie Winters, suggesting that the House Judiciary Committee could give Pomerantz immunity to testify about what Bragg was doing. Bannon then, in WarRoom’s final hour, further sounded off the Pomerantz footage, showing that the situation could be a key issue:  Bannon questioned numerous times why this footage was coming out now and expressed frustration that if it were not for people like the WarRoom audience demanding action, nothing would happen. It appeared that House Republicans would keep dragging their feet about protecting Trump. That point is foundational in why Bannon demands that Speaker Mike Johnson must be unseated, so this Pomerantz issue is also about the looming Motion to Vacate.

Resources for this article: Personnel Is Policy Press statement from President Donald J. Trump: Bannon recalls his own experience with Trump in 2016. "When Reince [Priebus] and I were announced, it was right after the election,” he says. He expects a similar timetable now, with top roles named by this weekend, perhaps even Sunday. "They want to name the top ten shortly,” Bannon predicts. He stresses the need for a clear direction right from the start, setting up the administration for decisive action. One of Bannon’s concerns is who may be influencing the personnel choices. He points to figures like Jeff Miller, a lobbyist closely tied to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Bannon doesn’t mince words on Miller’s role: "Jeff Miller is the swamp,” he says. Miller, a lobbyist powerhouse, was McCarthy’s central lobbyist, and Bannon holds him partly responsible for what he describes as the "horrible debt ceiling deal” that led to McCarthy’s historic removal as Speaker. “Miller’s all over Mar-a-Lago, telling corporate clients he’s running the deal,” Bannon says, highlighting his worry that corporate interests may again seep into Trump’s circle. Bannon argues that Miller represents a “corporate lobbyist mentality” mindset, particularly on immigration reform. "Their clients want cheap labor, so they push for open borders,” he says. For Bannon, this mindset is at odds with the populist movement he champions, and it’s something he hopes Trump’s new team will avoid. He warns against "sleazy lobbyists” who are "the connective tissue between Wall Street and Silicon Valley.” Amid these concerns, Bannon does see a promising start with appointing Susie Wiles as Trump’s Chief of Staff. Wiles, the first female in this role, has Bannon’s respect. He recalls her role in Trump’s 2016 Florida campaign, where she was crucial in securing the state for Trump. "Susie is steady Eddy,” Bannon says, praising her calm and even-handed approach. While some criticize Wiles for not being the most "dynamic individual,” Bannon sees her as a reliable leader capable of keeping the administration focused and grounded. Bannon also notes the importance of Wiles as a stabilizing figure, particularly with the urgency and intensity that Trump’s administration will bring. "With the urgency of people around President Trump and others helping from the outside, you need a steady hand,” he says. Wiles’ background, handling challenging situations without fanfare, is something Bannon thinks will benefit Trump’s operation. Looking forward, Bannon expects announcements on other high-impact roles in the coming days, like heads for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the National Security Council (NSC), and the National Economic Council (NEC). These offices, according to Bannon, are the "connective tissue” of government, managing everything from budget control to national defense. Bannon says, "OMB controls the actual government,” a post he hopes goes to someone like Russ Vought, who shares his commitment to fiscal responsibility. For the NSC, Bannon stresses the need for a strategic thinker capable of handling intense global affairs right from the Oval Office. Bannon warns that poor staffing choices could compromise Trump’s policy vision and alienate Trump’s growing coalition. He believes there’s real momentum for Trump’s populist policies and warns against letting lobbyists and corporate interests derail the plan. "People want the administration to deliver on populist policies,” he insists, highlighting the growing support Trump’s agenda has among working-class Americans, including Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. Bannon’s remarks outline a cautious optimism, seeing the early personnel choices, especially Wiles, as signs of hope. However, he remains wary of potential influences that could compromise the administration’s commitment to the movement. His message is clear: staffing choices will determine Trump’s ability to execute the policies that brought him to office and fulfill the promises made to his supporters. "We need warriors, not lobbyists,” Bannon says, setting the tone for what he hopes will be a focused and determined team. For more context, watch this Thursday WarRoom segment:

Steve Bannon and Rob Bluey discussed the upcoming challenges and critical actions President Trump will face upon taking office. They highlighted the importance of Trump’s executive orders on day one, which could range from immigration reforms to addressing the national debt and trade issues. Bannon emphasized the need for a swift and efficient Senate confirmation process to ensure that Trump’s team is in place to implement these orders, especially with a looming resistance from the “deep state” in the federal bureaucracy. Bluey shared a poll showing that nearly 50% of federal employees plan to resist Trump’s directives, particularly those who voted for Kamala Harris. He stressed that, unlike Democrats in 2021, Republicans must urgently confirm Trump’s cabinet to avoid delays in his agenda. The conversation also touched on the broader issue of entrenched bureaucrats who remain in power across administrations, undermining the president’s authority. Both Bannon and Bluey agreed on the need for action and unity among Republicans to support Trump’s priorities. They concluded by mentioning Daily Signal’s focus on Congress and their efforts to cover the confirmation hearings and provide timely updates on the administration’s progress.  Josh Pettit and Steve Bannon discussed the challenges in California politics, highlighting that the state’s problems are as deep, if not deeper, than those at the federal level. Pettit emphasized that despite efforts like recalling Governor Gavin Newsom or addressing local political incompetence, the core issues in California lie within its entrenched administrative and bureaucratic structures. He pointed out that California’s most powerful lobby isn’t the tech or labor lobby but the environmental lobby, which has shaped state politics for decades. The environmental industrial complex, Pettit explained, has gained immense control, particularly through agencies like the California Department of Water Resources and the California Coastal Commission. These agencies, he argued, hinder vital infrastructure projects such as water storage capacity, which could address California’s long-standing water shortages. Despite record rainfall in recent years, Pettit stressed that money allocated for water infrastructure had been misappropriated and funneled into environmental projects that benefit lobbyists and consultants. Pettit also discussed how California’s environmental laws, especially the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), have been weaponized to block projects. This, combined with constant litigation, delays critical infrastructure projects, leading to inefficiencies like the stalled high-speed rail project. Ultimately, Pettit warned that no political change could address California’s deep-rooted issues without dismantling these bureaucratic systems. He plans to expose this in future discussions further.  David Drucker joined the discussion, highlighting the strategic thinking behind the upcoming political battles, particularly focusing on the midterm elections. He pointed out that figures like Hakeem Jeffries are preparing to raise two billion dollars to flip key seats and regain control of the House. This power shift would set the stage for another round of impeachment efforts against former President Trump, signaling a return to familiar political confrontations. Drucker noted the significant involvement of high-profile figures like Mark Zuckerberg, who contribute millions to influence the outcome. He also referenced his piece in The Dispatch, where he discussed how political players anticipate these moves and position themselves strategically for the midterms.  Natalie Winters recounted recent events involving Mark Zuckerberg.  Darren Beattie talked about his recent investigations into the actions of Norm Eisen and Jen Rubin.  Ben Freeman talked his investigations into the actions of think tanks in the United States.  Natalie Winters mocked Michael Cohen

In this discussion between Ben Bergquam and Steve Bannon, they addressed the ongoing challenges at the U.S.-Mexico border and broader societal implications. Bergquam described his recent observations in San Diego, highlighting the surge of illegal immigrants, sanctuary policies protecting them, and organizations like Catholic Charities facilitating their entry. He criticized what he called the “illegal alien industrial complex,” alleging that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international entities profit from these activities while undermining American sovereignty. Bergquam linked the border crisis to a broader agenda, claiming it paves the way for domestic destabilization, including potential terror attacks and civil unrest similar to past events like the George Floyd riots. He warned of pre-positioning efforts by NGOs and complicit media to resist immigration reforms under a future Trump administration, despite the November 5th election results signaling public demand for change. Bannon emphasized that modern politics has evolved into a form of warfare, where systemic resistance to MAGA policies persists regardless of electoral outcomes. Both discussed the need for defunding and prosecuting organizations collaborating with cartels or undermining U.S. laws. They urged vigilance against what they described as a deliberate effort to create chaos and render illegal immigration permanent. The conversation highlighted concerns about national security, the weaponization of government apparatuses, and the erosion of public trust in institutions, framing these issues as part of a larger battle over America’s future.  Steve Bannon and Ava Chen discussed the current state of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Xi Jinping’s leadership, analyzing Xi’s New Year’s message and its implications. Bannon highlighted Xi’s declaration that Taiwan is a province of China and his warnings against foreign interference. Chen described the dire state of China’s economy, worsening living conditions, and growing resistance to the CCP, noting these signs of desperation could lead to extreme measures. Chen pointed out Xi’s increased control over Macau and Hong Kong, emphasizing the CCP’s use of threats against Taiwan. She connected current events to past warnings, such as the U.S.-China trade talks in 2019, where Xi’s regime allegedly hinted at opening a "Pandora’s box,” later linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. She outlined the CCP’s strategy, including economic manipulation, cyberattacks, and propaganda, aimed at destabilizing the West. Bannon and Chen warned of the CCP’s collaboration with Russia in escalating conflicts, such as the Ukraine invasion, and its long-term agenda against the U.S. Chen underscored the importance of exposing the CCP’s tactics through independent media like the New Federal State TV, calling for vigilance against these threats.  Steve Bannon and Brian Kennedy discussed the resilience of the American people in defending their nation and the challenges posed by the “dark enlightenment” narrative. Kennedy dismissed claims that Americans lack the morality and energy to preserve their civilization, citing grassroots efforts and the Trump movement as proof of their resolve. He emphasized the need to dismantle the administrative and Deep State, aligning with Trump’s vision for governance. The discussion contrasted this belief in self-governance with the technocratic, post-national ideologies promoted by figures like Elon Musk, who envision a future detached from the U.S. Constitution and sovereignty.  Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell discussed tensions within the MAGA movement, focusing on H1B visas and their impact on American workers. Harnwell argued that the movement, rooted in working-class support, faces challenges from billionaire elites pushing for policies like expansive immigration reform. He called for loyalty to President Trump while holding him accountable when necessary. Bannon emphasized unwavering support for American workers, advocating a total moratorium on immigration, legal or otherwise, citing concerns over abuses in programs like H1B. Both criticized President Trump’s promotion of a Boston Globe editorial, noting the publication’s anti-MAGA stance. They resolved to stay aligned with MAGA’s foundational principles, rejecting corporate and elite influences.  Natalie Winters talks about the state of employment in the United States and gives updates on the recent national controversy with the H-1B Visa debate.

On January 3, 2025, Steve Bannon reflected on the political shifts marking the new year, focusing on the 118th Congress and its historical significance. He highlighted the grassroots effort that led to the unprecedented removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, underscoring the audience’s critical role in reshaping political leadership. McCarthy, now pursuing ventures in artificial intelligence, symbolizes the shift from establishment politics to a movement rooted in populist accountability. Bannon emphasized the erosion of the constitutional republic, attributing the nation’s decline to a betrayal of its foundational principles and the exploitation of its sovereignty by elites. This discontent, he noted, was the catalyst for Donald Trump’s rise in 2016, defying a well-funded and fragmented Republican establishment. Bannon recounted pivotal moments like Dave Brat’s grassroots victory over Eric Cantor in 2014, illustrating the power of citizen-led revolts against entrenched interests. Bannon criticized the Biden administration’s handling of immigration, claiming millions of illegal entries had strained resources and disadvantaged American citizens, particularly minorities. He argued that both legal and illegal immigration systems were rigged against the average American. Concluding, Bannon called for renewed focus on the "task and purpose” of Congress under Speaker Mike Johnson. He urged his audience to remain engaged, using their agency to hold leaders accountable and advance Trump’s agenda. The ultimate goal, he stressed, is not just navigating obstacles but defining the movement’s path forward with clarity and purpose.  Steve Bannon delivered a wide-ranging commentary on the structural, procedural, and policy challenges facing Congress and the nation, highlighting the complexities of governance and the interplay of political and economic forces. He criticized backroom deals in Congress, particularly under Kevin McCarthy, which he claims betrayed voters and deepened the national debt. He praised the structural reforms achieved during the 118th Congress, such as empowering conservatives on the Rules Committee and increasing transparency in appropriations, but emphasized the need for continued vigilance and reform. Bannon underscored the stakes of the 119th Congress, including the selection of a Speaker and critical legislative battles over border security, crime reduction, and government weaponization. He argued that fiscal mismanagement, exemplified by deficits and unrestrained spending, is pushing the U.S. toward bankruptcy. Bannon criticized reliance on the Federal Reserve’s money-printing and warned of global challenges to the dollar’s dominance, driven by inflation and alternative currency strategies from BRICS nations. He stressed the importance of citizen engagement and transparency, encouraging Americans to understand legislative processes and hold politicians accountable. Bannon also touched on pressing issues such as the Ukraine conflict, border security, and immigration reform, framing them as critical to U.S. sovereignty. He concluded by urging bold leadership to address the nation’s economic and geopolitical crises, portraying the current moment as pivotal for restoring conservative values and national stability.  Steve Bannon outlined his strategy and expectations for addressing pressing political issues under a prospective Trump administration. He emphasized the need for strategic decision-making, leveraging timing, and prioritizing critical objectives. These include resolving the financial crisis, ending foreign conflicts without direct U.S. involvement, addressing illegal immigration, and dismantling the administrative state. Bannon acknowledged the challenges ahead but underscored the necessity of these steps to fulfill the populist agenda. Bannon expressed dissatisfaction with current political realities, including the complexities of selecting a Speaker of the House and the limitations of legislative processes. He supported using reconciliation to bypass Senate filibusters and fast-track critical policies. His proposed focus for reconciliation includes immigration reforms, such as border security, deportations, and visa overhauls, coupled with energy policies to bolster the "Make America Great Again” agenda. Reflecting on Trump’s anticipated second term, Bannon advocated for an aggressive, multifaceted approach, including executive orders to reverse Biden-era policies. He suggested that legislative and executive actions be launched simultaneously, creating momentum and overwhelming opposition. Bannon also criticized the establishment and deep state for obstructing reform efforts, highlighting the need for precision and resilience in leadership. While skeptical of Speaker candidate Mike Johnson’s capabilities, Bannon emphasized the importance of unity and clear direction to navigate upcoming political turbulence. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon passionately addressed the audience, emphasizing the need for the 119th Congress to bring transformative changes to “Make America Great Again.” He criticized the establishment’s legislative agenda, particularly the “Dignity Act,” which he described as favoring foreign workers over American citizens. Bannon called for a moratorium on immigration and a reevaluation of current policies, arguing that the system exploits American workers to benefit corporate and global interests. He criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for failing to deliver substantive reforms, accusing him of negotiating behind closed doors and pushing a 1,500-page spending bill riddled with wasteful provisions. Bannon called for accountability and transparency, urging his audience to demand promises be kept. Bannon highlighted “kitchen table issues,” emphasizing the financial struggles of American families. He argued that unchecked immigration undercuts wages and economic opportunities for citizens, particularly minorities. Drawing historical parallels, he suggested that the MAGA movement could create a “1932-style coalition” uniting African Americans, Hispanics, and working-class Americans disillusioned with the Democratic Party. He urged the audience to stay vigilant, stressing the fight against entrenched powers, such as corporatists and financial elites, who prioritize endless wars and wealth concentration over citizens’ well-being. Bannon framed this struggle as a moral imperative to prioritize American workers and families, advocating for policies that support economic self-sufficiency and national sovereignty. In conclusion, Bannon painted the ongoing political battle as a defining moment for restoring American values and empowering the working class. Part One:  Natalie Winters joined Steve Bannon to echo Bannon’s point of view on the H-1B Visas and Dignity Act interference. Part Two:  Steve Bannon delivered an impassioned critique of the current political and economic landscape, emphasizing the urgency of reform within the GOP and broader U.S. governance. He highlighted the Freedom Caucus’s reluctant support for Speaker Johnson, driven by loyalty to President Trump rather than Johnson’s policies. Trump, Bannon noted, has been a pivotal figure in unifying factions within the Republican Party around his agenda. Bannon criticized the entrenched reliance on “easy money” and modern monetary theory, likening it to addiction that requires a painful detoxification process. He underscored the need for fiscal responsibility, highlighting the burden of debt and high-interest rates. This, he argued, necessitates prioritizing American citizens over expenditures on foreign aid and illegal immigration. The speaker race and broader Congressional inaction were central to Bannon’s critique. He accused Republican leaders of performative politics, citing failures in defending border security and energy independence. He condemned policies that auctioned off border wall materials and called out GOP complicity in enabling President Biden’s fiscal agenda. Bannon also spotlighted the dangers of unchecked immigration, particularly from countries like China, framing it as a threat to American sovereignty. He advocated for systemic reforms to asylum laws and immigration policies to prioritize American workers. Finally, Bannon outlined preparations for a potential second Trump term, emphasizing the importance of staffing key positions to ensure swift action. He called for accountability within government institutions and robust efforts to dismantle entrenched bureaucracy and ideological opposition.

In their exchange, Steve Bannon and Congressman Chip Roy delved into critical issues surrounding Congress’s reconciliation processes, budget debates, and House Speaker Johnson’s leadership. Roy expressed frustration over insufficient guardrails for conservative priorities and the lack of a structured reconciliation plan that aligns with deficit reduction and border security. He emphasized the need for a robust rules committee to ensure conservative legislation reaches the floor, advocating for a two-bill approach to separately address border security and broader spending reforms. Roy criticized recent events, including the controversial 1,500-page spending bill negotiated with Democrats, calling it a failure of leadership and a betrayal of conservative principles. While he acknowledged Speaker Johnson’s efforts and apologized missteps, Roy stressed the necessity of accountability and a shift away from rushed, opaque legislative processes. Bannon echoed Roy’s concerns, highlighting the urgency of delivering clear wins on Trump-era policies like border security and energy reforms, which underpin the MAGA economic agenda. Both emphasized the importance of swift action and vigilance to ensure future legislative efforts reflect conservative values and public mandates. The discussion concluded with a shared commitment to holding Speaker Johnson accountable and securing decisive legislative victories.  Steve Bannon emphasized the importance of the WarRoom audience as the “vanguard” in addressing the challenges facing the United States. He highlighted issues like massive budget deficits, administrative state overreach, and unsustainable debt. Bannon critiqued legislative strategies, advocating for clear and decisive action, particularly on border security, immigration, and energy policies. He called for swift passage of focused bills that prioritize working-class interests, criticizing corporate and lobbyist influence over policymaking. Bannon urged transparency and accountability, emphasizing that Americans, particularly MAGA supporters, have the common sense to support meaningful reforms. He warned of tough times ahead but expressed optimism that populist priorities like fair taxation and economic reforms could prevail. Stressing urgency, he called for comprehensive investigations, particularly into immigration and January 6-related matters, to ensure nothing is hidden from the public. His closing message emphasized determination and the need for immediate wins in advancing populist goals.  Steve Bannon hosted Mike Davis on WarRoom to discuss the breaking developments surrounding Donald Trump’s legal battles. Judge Juan Merchan in New York has ruled that Trump, despite being the president-elect, is not immune from sentencing for charges brought against him. This ruling refutes Trump’s legal team’s argument that his presidential immunity should delay or dismiss sentencing, stemming from 34 felony convictions related to business practices. Trump is required to appear in court on January 10, either in person or virtually, for sentencing. Mike Davis criticized Judge Merchan as biased, citing alleged political affiliations and connections to Democratic figures. Davis argued that the case is driven by partisan motives, aiming to tarnish Trump’s image before his inauguration. He highlighted procedural errors, such as breaches of presidential immunity, and labeled the charges as baseless. Bannon echoed Davis’s sentiments, portraying the legal proceedings as part of a broader campaign to undermine Trump and the MAGA movement. He emphasized the movement’s resilience and accused the establishment of attempting to prevent Trump’s return to power. Both expressed skepticism over the legal fairness of the process, forecasting appeals and further legal maneuvers by Trump’s team. Part One:  Part Two:  Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon delved into a complex web of incidents involving an individual with alleged connections to advanced technology and national security threats. Posobiec detailed the suspect’s erratic behavior, including reported infidelity, mental health issues, and a failed attempt to join Ukrainian brigades before returning to the U.S. The individual later conducted an attack and sent emails warning of leadership failures and threats to national security, which Posobiec highlighted as alarming yet unverified. The emails referenced advanced drone technology allegedly developed by the Chinese Communist Party, hinting at potential drone strikes from Chinese submarines along the Atlantic. Posobiec and Bannon discussed connections to Sequoia Capital and Elon Musk, speculating on the role of U.S. corporations in enabling such technology. They emphasized the need for heightened security measures, including drone jammers and geofencing of autonomous vehicles, particularly with the upcoming inauguration in mind. Bannon stressed the gravity of emerging threats, whether domestic or foreign, and the urgency for robust security preparations to mitigate potential attacks. Posobiec echoed these concerns, emphasizing the importance of timely intelligence sharing and proactive measures to prevent catastrophic incidents.  Natalie Winters talked about the negatives of the H-1B Visa program, including the general idea that the program is for bringing over talent that the United States citizen does not have.  Chris Fenton and others have raised concerns about the implications of educating international students, particularly from countries like China, at elite U.S. universities. They argue that this trend may disadvantage American students by taking spots that could otherwise go to domestic talent. Additionally, Chinese students are perceived as being under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), raising fears that their U.S. education and expertise could be weaponized against American interests or used to strengthen adversarial nations. Economic concerns also feature prominently, as international graduates often remain in the U.S., competing for jobs with Americans and exacerbating challenges for blue-collar and middle-class workers. Critics of the current system propose policies mandating that international students return to their home countries after graduation or limiting their admission at elite institutions to prioritize American citizens. They also highlight systemic issues in academia, such as universities relying on full-paying international students to fund tenured professors and administrative expenses, which is seen as prioritizing financial incentives over national interests. While the contributions of international students are acknowledged, the discussion emphasizes safeguarding American innovation and competitiveness, reflecting broader debates on immigration, education, and national security.  Steve Bannon and Brian Costello discussed alarming concerns about Chinese technology, specifically drones, and the implications of U.S. investment ties to China. Costello emphasized the involvement of American venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital, in funding Chinese companies aligned with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), enabling the development of advanced military technologies, including drones. They pointed to a tragic incident involving a veteran in Las Vegas, who reportedly took his life to highlight these issues. According to a manifesto linked to the event, the individual alleged that drones over U.S. airspace were of Chinese origin and increasingly aggressive, raising questions about national security and the risks of unchecked investment in China. The conversation delved into how some technologies, like those developed for consumer platforms such as TikTok, have dual-use applications, including military command systems. Bannon and Costello criticized the ongoing reluctance of U.S. policymakers to impose strict restrictions on outbound investments into China, calling this approach “asinine” given the CCP’s integration of civilian and military industries. They stressed the need for immediate congressional action and leadership change within U.S. security agencies to address these threats. Bannon also connected the discussion to broader political challenges, urging urgent reforms in intelligence and defense leadership. Highlighting the critical state of national security, he called for a more aggressive stance to protect American interests, signaling the importance of prioritizing this issue in upcoming discussions. The conversation underscored the urgency of addressing China’s technological and military advances.

Natalie Winters talked about the fires in California ad called into question the leadership of Gavin Newsom. Part One:  Part Two:  Mike Cernovich talked to Natalie Winters about the details of the fires in California and what he knew about people who lived in the area as well as the political problems in the state that may have increased the likelihood of the tragic fires.  Cernovich told Winters he felt that President Trump should consider a federal takeover the state.  In this discussion on Steve Bannon’s War Room, Mike Davis highlighted the contentious North Carolina Supreme Court race, where Democrat Allison Riggs claimed victory by 734 votes. Davis argued that 60,000 ballots cast without required voter identification—driver’s license numbers or Social Security digits—were illegitimate. He criticized Democratic operatives for attempting to certify these votes and praised the North Carolina Supreme Court for pausing certification to address the legality of these ballots. Davis implied that such issues point to broader concerns about voter integrity and potentially unlawful practices. Bannon and Davis linked this controversy to broader themes, such as the importance of judicial elections and the role of external organizations like Davis’s Article III Project. Davis urged War Room listeners to support President Trump’s agenda actively, particularly in securing qualified cabinet picks. He stressed the significance of grassroots mobilization and the War Room audience’s influence on political outcomes. Bannon echoed Davis’s sentiments, commending his past efforts in judicial confirmations and advocacy for election integrity. Together, they underscored the importance of vigilant action in safeguarding democracy and ensuring fair governance.  In their conversation, Jason Jones, currently in Turkey, discusses his mission with Steve Bannon on WarRoom. Jones explains that he is meeting with persecuted Christian and minority communities across the Middle East through his Vulnerable People Project, which has advocated for these groups since 2003. He highlights the ongoing genocide and decimation of ancient Christian communities in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon, urging Middle Eastern leaders to protect these vulnerable populations. Jones acknowledges Turkey’s strategic significance, despite its political complexities. He emphasizes Turkish President Erdoğan’s aspirations to re-establish the Ottoman Empire and its caliphate roots, underpinned by a resurgence of the Muslim Brotherhood. Bannon agrees, describing Turkey as a serious geopolitical force with a vision of regaining dominance over Islamic holy sites. Jones notes that the Middle East’s diversity is often misunderstood in the West and stresses the need for partnerships to preserve its ethnic and religious communities. He praises Bannon’s influence and thanks him for the platform to advocate for Christian minorities. The conversation also briefly touches on Jones’s article critiquing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s positions on international issues.  John Mills joined Steve Bannon on WarRoom to discuss the geopolitical tensions in South Korea and the region’s significance as a major U.S. ally. With 28,000 U.S. troops stationed there and critical military installations, Mills emphasizes the United States’ unwavering support for South Korea. Mills outlines escalating domestic and regional challenges. He highlights a power struggle in South Korea, where the Democratic Party is allegedly using unconstitutional tactics to consolidate power, including actions involving the National Election Commission. President Yoon Suk-yeol’s recent declaration of martial law, purportedly to address corruption, underscores the gravity of the situation. On the international front, North Korea’s recent mobilization of artillery from underground shelters into firing positions signals heightened tensions. Mills warns that the Chinese Communist Party might exploit the unrest to assert influence in the region. Bannon and Mills commend South Korea’s resilience and strong Christian heritage, emphasizing the need for vigilance and solidarity. Mills provides updates on social media platforms, promising ongoing coverage of the unfolding situation. The discussion underscores the strategic importance of South Korea in maintaining stability in East Asia amid growing threats from North Korea and China.

On Thursday evening’s WarRoom, Steve Bannon delivered a fiery critique of former President George W. Bush’s behavior at Jimmy Carter’s state funeral. Bannon highlighted Bush’s blatant snub of Donald Trump, walking past the former president without acknowledgment. In contrast, Bush leaned into Barack Obama with a jovial jab, which Bannon described as classless and disrespectful. Bannon criticized the Bush family and their allies for lacking integrity and responsibility, particularly over their role in national crises like the Iraq War, 9/11, and the 2008 financial collapse. He labeled Bush as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, second only to James Buchanan. Bannon also took aim at other establishment figures, including Karl Rove and Mike Pence, accusing them of spinelessness and betrayal of MAGA values. Bannon’s sharpest condemnation was reserved for the use of John Lennon’s Imagine—a song he called "atheistic” and "depraved”—at the National Cathedral during the funeral. He framed the moment as emblematic of the cultural decline MAGA seeks to reverse. Despite the slight to Trump, Bannon underscored that Trump’s focus remains on his mission to save the country, standing above the pettiness of his detractors. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly delved into critical updates on legal challenges facing Donald Trump, focusing on tomorrow’s scheduled sentencing in New York and developments in Florida regarding Jack Smith’s report. Bannon noted Judge Merchan’s likely prepared condemnation of Trump during sentencing, emphasizing the political underpinnings of the case. Kelly highlighted that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, overseeing an emergency stay application, has yet to act, raising concerns about potential partisan motivations. The discussion shifted to Jack Smith’s controversial draft report, intermingling classified documents and January 6 cases, which Trump’s legal team is trying to prevent from being publicized. The 11th Circuit granted Trump’s request to file an amicus brief, and Judge Cannon issued an order temporarily blocking the DOJ from sharing the report outside its ranks. Kelly explained that co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago case have requested further hearings, adding complexity to the legal battle. Bannon and Kelly criticized Jay Bratt, a former DOJ prosecutor tied to the Mar-a-Lago raid, accusing him of partisan motives and unethical practices. Bratt recently resigned after a controversial career. The conversation underscored the politicization of Trump’s legal challenges, the liberal judicial bias alleged by Kelly and Bannon, and the broader implications for 2024. Kelly concluded with updates on her platforms, promising real-time coverage as these pivotal events unfold. Both commentators framed the legal struggles as emblematic of ongoing political warfare targeting Trump and his allies.  Steve Bannon hosted Texas Republican Party Chairman Abraham George to discuss key political tensions in Texas, particularly the House Speaker’s race and its implications for conservative governance. They highlighted grassroots MAGA supporters’ significant contributions in securing Republican victories, emphasizing Texas as a stronghold for the movement. The conversation turned to George W. Bush’s perceived snub of Donald Trump at the National Cathedral, which George criticized as disrespectful, especially in Trump-supporting Texas. The discussion delved into longstanding issues with Texas House leadership. George explained that moderate Republicans have historically aligned with Democrats to select the Speaker, granting Democrats influential committee positions that hinder conservative legislation. He noted grassroots efforts demanding the Speaker be chosen solely by Republican caucus members to advance the party’s priorities. Bannon and George emphasized the immense power of the Texas House Speaker, who controls critical legislative outcomes. While George outlined grassroots strategies to address the problem, the conversation was cut short, leaving the solution incomplete. Bannon underscored the stakes, portraying the situation as a microcosm of broader political battles, including resistance against the Bush political apparatus and establishment forces undermining MAGA’s agenda.  Natalie Winters talked about the failures of Gavin Newsome and the Democrats in California that led up to a disastrous result with the most recent fire damage to property.  Jeremy Kauffman argues that the left denies reality and then becomes angry when the consequences emerge. He highlights this in several areas, including diversity initiatives, forest management, and insurance markets, particularly in California. Kauffman criticizes policies that ignore merit, such as prioritizing inclusivity over competence in critical roles like firefighting, leading to predictable adverse outcomes. On the insurance market, Kauffman points out that California’s law restricting insurers to using only historical data for pricing prevents them from accounting for future risks, like increasing wildfire threats. As a result, insurers, unable to charge appropriate premiums for high-risk areas like the Palisades, dropped thousands of homeowners, as insurance is a business and not a charity. Kauffman also criticizes environmental policies that prevent effective forest management, leading to a buildup of fire risks. He predicts that California politicians will scapegoat insurance companies, demand bailouts, and impose further regulations instead of addressing the root causes, perpetuating a cycle of denial and failure.  Savanah Hernandez highlights California’s severe wildfire crisis and the state government’s failures in fire prevention and response. During her visit to San Diego, she witnessed homeless encampments as sources of fires, which often grow into massive, destructive blazes. She then traveled to Altadena, where residents faced devastating fires without sufficient firefighter presence or preparation despite prior warnings about strong winds. One resident recounted watching fires rage for over an hour before evacuating, with no fire crews or helicopters responding due to the winds. Many locals resorted to protecting their homes with personal sprinklers and hoses. In one case, a woman was blocked by police from delivering fire hoses to her property. Hernandez criticized California’s outdated infrastructure, noting no new water reservoirs have been built since the 1980s. She also pointed to government negligence, such as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass being abroad during citywide evacuations, and the lack of forest and fire management. Hernandez highlighted frustrations among residents paying high taxes but receiving little help. Many suspect some fires were intentionally set, and she emphasized the role of homelessness in contributing to fires, exposing systemic mismanagement and misplaced priorities in the state.  Natalie Winters talked about the likelihood that Lawfare is not going to simply go away when President Trump gets back to the White House, as Jack Smith and Judge Merchan are attempting to box Trump in, and label him a felon, before the 20th when Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president of the US.

Natalie Winters talked about her opinion of the government and her continued themes of why she dislikes Republicans and the GOP.  Derrek Harvey critiques U.S. and Israeli military strategy in responding to attacks from Iran. He acknowledges that the IDF, supported by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, managed to intercept some of the nearly 200 missiles, but he warns that “the strategy of just absorbing attacks from Iran is not going to succeed.” Harvey argues that Iran is willing to sacrifice Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank in its efforts to destroy Israel. He advocates for a direct response, stating, “The only response is going to have to be…damaging their economy,” by targeting Iran’s oil and gas capabilities and military assets. Additionally, Harvey suggests the U.S. should focus on non-combatant evacuations, protecting embassies, and responding decisively if attacked. He criticizes the Biden administration, saying, “We do not understand deterrence” and “winning wars matters because it sets the conditions for peace.”  Mark Mitchell criticizes mainstream media, particularly MSNBC, for dividing America by pushing false narratives. He highlights that “66% of voters are concerned that the outcome of this election will be affected by cheating,” dismissing claims of the “big lie.” Mitchell rebuffs accusations that his polling is right-leaning, stating that even “The New York Times is to the right of us.” He claims media pollsters consistently use tactics like oversampling Democrats, particularly with Kamala Harris, and presents his own firm as unbiased, noting, “Every time anyone gives us a dime, we declare our sponsorship.” Mitchell predicts that Kamala Harris is losing critical swing states like Michigan and faces further challenges, such as supply chain shortages, rising prices, and potential war in the Middle East. He believes this bodes well for Donald Trump, adding, “Trump’s going to outperform the polling.” He emphasizes that these issues could lead to a shift in support away from Harris, as political narratives evolve closer to Election Day.  Mike Benz argues that censorship using AI, particularly regarding public health issues, is not a future threat but something that has already been happening for years. He explains that “AI keywords” have been used to censor online discussions, particularly during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Benz highlights the involvement of figures like Bill Gates, who is a co-investor in U.S. State Department and military endeavors, and claims that Gates benefits from taxpayer-funded efforts to protect his reputation online against conspiracy theories. He explains that a Pentagon contractor, Graphika, received $7 million to use AI to scan conversations in NATO countries and suppress content critical of Gates. This, according to Benz, violates the First Amendment as public health crises are used as “a humanitarian intervention excuse” to justify military and intelligence involvement. He emphasizes that this censorship, designed to protect Gates’ financial empire, is an ongoing reality rather than a hypothetical concern.  In their discussion, Mike Davis and Mark Paoletta highlight the weaponization of law enforcement, drawing parallels between past and present political battles. Davis introduces Paoletta, praising his crucial role in Supreme Court confirmations, especially for Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas. Paoletta recounts his experience during Thomas’s confirmation, emphasizing the left’s viciousness and their attempts to “destroy” Thomas, not just defeat him. He recalls the intense opposition Thomas faced for being a “black man who thinks on his own,” which Paoletta sees as the left’s cardinal sin. Paoletta also reflects on his work defending Thomas and describes how these experiences shaped his understanding of political weaponization. They compare this to the current attacks on Donald Trump, with Davis noting that Trump has been indicted multiple times and faced attempts to remove him from ballots. Davis and Paoletta argue that Trump is facing the same kind of lawfare they saw used against Thomas and other conservative figures. Looking ahead to a potential second Trump administration, Paoletta outlines the need for accountability. He advocates for firing FBI Director Christopher Wray and Special Counsel Jack Smith, dissolving the January 6 unit, and reviewing the prosecutions related to January 6. Paoletta stresses that these steps are crucial to prevent the left’s use of law enforcement to interfere in future elections. Part One:  Part Two:  In a conversation on election integrity, Mike Davis, Cleta Mitchell, and Mark Lucas addressed concerns about non-citizen voting and the challenges posed in swing states like Arizona, Virginia, and Georgia. Mitchell highlighted a report from Arizona, where 218,000 registered voters failed to provide proof of citizenship, a significant increase from the previously identified 98,000. She mentioned officials downplaying the issue, stating, “It’s just a glitch, but it’s a big problem.” In Virginia, a citizens’ group found around 1,000 votes cast by non-citizens, which Mitchell emphasized as a growing issue across the country, noting, “This is their new political majority for the Democrats.” Davis discussed the Article 3 Project’s efforts to push the Save Act, which targets illegal voting, and their campaign to raise awareness. In Georgia, Lucas discussed ongoing legal challenges regarding election machines and board oversight, with Davis emphasizing the tension between state election boards and progressive opposition, stating, “The whole establishment media is howling.” Part One:  Part Two:

Natalie Winters responded to the Vanity Fair article about Steve Bannon and the WarRoom, criticizing people who are continuing to support Ukraine as a priority for American spending.  Darren Beattie discussed the investigations of the Pipe bombs from Jan. 6th, 2021, and a new report that he has been following and reporting on—showing Federal informant involvement on that date. He questioned the timing of holding the report back until after the November election.  Mike Benz talked about the CIA and the DOD and their operations and talked about his suspicion over a case with a person who had been detained for terrorism being delayed.  Natalie Winters referred to the Vanity Fair article about Steve Bannon.  In this conversation between Ben Harnwell and Brandon Showalter of The Christian Post, they discussed recent data from the CDC, which showed 3.3% of high school students identify as transgender, with an additional 2.2% questioning their gender. Showalter argued that this is not a natural phenomenon, but the result of “ideological indoctrination” within schools. He claimed that the concept of being “born in the wrong body” is an “anthropological falsehood” and part of a broader agenda. Showalter emphasized the dangers of medical treatments for gender dysphoria, likening gender-affirming care to “atrocious medical scandals” such as lobotomies. He criticized the inconsistency of allowing gender transition procedures for minors while prohibiting tattoos. Showalter also noted how some European countries are scaling back on such treatments, contrasting them with the U.S. and Canada, which are continuing these practices.  He concluded by promoting his documentary series, Generation Indoctrination, which explores the transgender debate and its impact on families In their conversation, Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell discussed the state of polling and media narratives surrounding the 2024 presidential race. Mitchell expressed satisfaction that Rasmussen’s predictions, particularly about Donald Trump leading Joe Biden, have been accurate, saying, "I should be taking a victory lap.” He noted that the polls have consistently shown Trump ahead, and media claims of sudden shifts are misleading, with the polling staying “locked in steady.” Mitchell emphasized that Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, has consistently struggled, saying, “She overwhelmingly lost” when compared to a “fresh start” candidate. He also pointed out the media’s efforts to paint her as a strong contender, despite her own admission of being an underdog. Referring to Trump’s dominance, Mitchell remarked, "She needs an act of God to win.” They also touched on betting markets, where Mitchell explained that Trump’s chances have dramatically increased, with movements in key battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, now leaning towards Trump. He concluded that, despite some denial in the media, the numbers clearly indicate that “Trump is winning this thing,” and that even poll aggregators like Nate Silver may soon reflect this reality.   Ben Harnwell and Col. John Mills, Mills discusses concerns over foreign influence on U.S. elections, the effectiveness of intelligence agencies, and the integrity of election laws. Mills shares details about a meeting with intelligence agencies, including the FBI and Homeland Security, where officials briefed about foreign involvement in U.S. elections. Mills was critical, saying, “For $80 billion a year, we’re not necessarily getting our top people.” He questioned why U.S. Code 611, which requires U.S. citizenship to vote, was omitted from discussions on election laws: “It’s not debatable. You have to be a U.S. citizen to vote.” Mills also raised concerns about a deep-state agenda, suggesting that intelligence agencies might use election interference as a pretext to expand domestic spying. He said, “They want to go after populists… they want to manipulate the vote.” Mills also pointed out discrepancies, such as the omission of assassination attempts by Iranian operatives, linking Iran’s actions to China’s influence: “Iran would not exist today if it wasn’t for China.” The conversation highlights skepticism about the intelligence community’s handling of election security and foreign interference.  Ben Harnwell and Sigal Chattah discussed the urgency of ballot harvesting efforts in Nevada ahead of the 2024 election, following its decriminalization in 2020. Chattah emphasized the need for action, saying, “We are officially going to start changing gears to ballot harvesting operations,” and highlighted the involvement of groups like America First, Turning Point USA, and others. She encouraged voters to speak to neighbors and ensure they vote, noting that economic challenges, such as a 22% inflation rate and high gas prices, can only be addressed by supporting Donald Trump. Chattah also stressed the importance of voting down ballot to maintain the Republican majority in Nevada’s legislature. She warned, “If Republicans do not maintain the Senate this legislative cycle, we will see a state income tax passed.” She urged people to sign up at the Nevada GOP website and join the ballot-harvesting efforts. Chattah mentioned Trump’s upcoming events in Reno and encouraged participation while reminding listeners of her observance of Yom Kippur.  Grace Chong’s comments highlight the significant influence of Steve Bannon’s War Room show and its dedicated audience, which she calls the “Army of the Awakened.” Chong enthusiastically shares that a recent Vanity Fair article acknowledges the War Room’s impact, especially noting how Bannon has turned the show into a platform for educating everyday Americans on the global power structure. She emphasizes that Bannon’s reference to his audience as “peasants” is a badge of honor, symbolizing their crucial role in challenging the elite and corrupt systems. According to Chong, Bannon views the movement’s strength as lying in the ordinary Americans, who together can make a difference. Chong encourages the War Room Posse to read the article and keep the momentum going, especially as early voting begins across crucial battleground states. She stresses the importance of ensuring voter registration before deadlines in states like North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada. Additionally, Chong highlights the need for early ballot chasing to counter the Democrats’ extended efforts in the previous election cycle. She motivates the audience to stay involved, urging them to spread the word and continue their activism, which she says is visibly shaking the system.   Chong also thanks everyone who has sent JoJo encouraging notes to uplift her spirits. JoJo has also shared these notes with the WarRoom team for encouragement, reporting that the team likes to talk about the supportive messages they are getting.

Natalie Winters discussed her theories about a looming disinformation censorship campaign, a House memo on misinformation on social media, Barack Obama, and children being taught to identify misinformation.  Jeff Lark and Eric Teetsel from the Center for Renewing America reacted to an Axios article. They confirmed that they believe Democrats will allow them to skip the certification process when President Trump wins.  Tom Fitton from Judicial Watch group discussed their efforts to ensure election integrity and combat corruption in government. Judicial Watch has been actively involved in legal battles to clean up voter rolls, leading to the removal of over four million names across the country. Fitton emphasized the importance of states maintaining accurate voter rolls, stating, “You just can’t be mailing out ballots to dirty lists.” Fitton also criticized the Biden administration’s spending on illegal immigration while neglecting American citizens, particularly in crises, calling it “an invasion” that undermines the country. He expressed frustration with Congress for not fulfilling their oversight responsibilities, saying, “They do some hearings, but a lot more needs to be done.” Judicial Watch is also involved in lawsuits exposing “woke” DEI mandates in military academies, which Fitton argued are alienating future military leaders by promoting left-wing ideologies. He underscored the need to fight back against these policies, calling them “outrageously taught.” Fitton concluded by urging the public to stay informed about Judicial Watch’s work, stating that their fight on these essential issues is critical to “the future of the country.”  Brandon Straka provided an update on his latest work with the WalkAway campaign, emphasizing the continued exodus from the Democratic Party. He released a new video, a “sequel” to his original WalkAway video, highlighting the erosion of freedoms, culture, and voting systems under Democratic leadership. Straka explained, "We’re texting one million undecided voters in swing states,” with a focus on racial minorities, pointing to Obama’s recent attempt to sway Black men toward Kamala Harris. He noted that people are increasingly questioning traditional generational voting patterns, particularly in minority communities. Straka discussed how fear, instilled by left-wing media, keeps many loyal to the Democratic Party. His outreach includes minority town halls and educational videos to challenge media narratives. He also mentioned that the WalkAway movement now includes high-profile figures, like Cherie Currie and Susan Olsen, leaving Hollywood and speaking out against the left’s “woke agenda.” Straka concluded by encouraging people to join the movement, stating, "I don’t want to be part of the further degradation of our country.”  Tina Desovich, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, shared her thoughts on the media’s push of transgender ideology, particularly in schools. She highlighted alarming statistics, noting, "Five and a half percent of American students are either identifying as transgender or questioning their gender,” calling it an epidemic. Desovich expressed concern over schools teaching children as young as four that they can change their gender, saying, "When you send your child to public school, what are they teaching them about their gender?” She emphasized the role of Moms for Liberty in empowering parents to reclaim control over their children’s education, medical care, and religion. The organization provides resources and tools, including model policies for school districts, to counteract gender ideology. Desovich also discussed Moms for Liberty’s involvement in a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration’s Title IX rewrite, which they argue undermines protections for girls’ sports and spaces. "We’ve had over 5,000 schools exempt from applying the new Title IX rewrite,” she stated. Desovich reaffirmed the group’s mission to "unify, educate, and empower” parents to protect their children’s rights and education from what she sees as an overreach by schools and the state.  Brian Kennedy emphasized the ongoing concern over election integrity in the U.S., stating, “A lot of Americans think the 2020 election was stolen, maybe half the country.” He noted that despite efforts from groups like Judicial Watch, the system has not significantly changed as the country heads toward the 2024 election. However, Kennedy expressed more confidence in the current state of election systems in key swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, which he believes are improved from 2020. He also echoed President Trump’s approach, saying that in 2024, the focus should be on making the election "too big to rig.” Kennedy criticized Vice President Kamala Harris as a weak candidate, stating, "The more she’s on television, the worse it gets.” He predicted a “suppressed” Democratic vote and an overwhelming turnout for Trump, fueled by dissatisfaction with the current administration and strong support for Trump. Kennedy urged everyone to encourage their friends and family to vote, describing it as a “clarion call” for those who believe in human decency.

Natalie Winters reacts to a news article that calls her out for her remarks about retribution when President Trump is re-elected, saying that certain people will face “Treason” charges.  Winters doubles down, saying Miley will also face “Treason” charges from Trump in her rant.  Davis critiqued the legal and political actions taken against Donald Trump and others associated with him, describing them as part of a broader “lawfare” strategy aimed at undermining Trump’s political career. He argues that Obama, Biden, and their teams engaged in illegal actions, such as the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, to spy on Trump and protect figures like Hillary Clinton. Davis claims Clinton’s actions, including foreign bribery through the Clinton Foundation, were hidden, and similar tactics were used in 2020 to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. He criticizes the indictments against Trump and his allies as politically motivated attempts to interfere with the 2024 election. Davis calls for a criminal investigation into what he views as a conspiracy against Trump, emphasizing that justice, not retribution, should be the goal. He also highlights concerns about a Colorado Supreme Court judge, Monica Marquez, who he believes is a left-wing radical, urging voters to remove her from office due to her extreme views. Part One:  Part Two:  Jim Hoft, in his commentary on The Gateway Pundit, focuses on the alleged overseas voting fraud and media backlash. He highlights that the media, particularly outlets like MSNBC, are now discussing overseas votes after his team exposed the lack of voter ID requirements for overseas ballots. Hoft criticizes the system, claiming that individuals, including non-citizens, can vote using just an email address, without proving citizenship or residency in certain states like Michigan. He argues this loophole can be exploited to sway elections in swing states, noting several lawsuits in states like North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have emerged since his reports. Hoft also dismisses claims that exposing these issues is an attack on military voters, emphasizing that his focus is on potential fraud, not legitimate military votes. He calls on Republicans to take legal action in battleground states to address what he sees as a fraudulent system being used by Democrats to influence the 2024 election.  Benjamin Roberts, associate editor of I’m 1776, discussed the systemic issues in Springfield, Ohio, where NGOs and local churches, often backed by federal subsidies, play a significant role in facilitating the resettlement of Haitian migrants. Roberts revealed that these organizations prioritize migrant housing and employment, often to the detriment of local citizens, including newly homeless Americans. He pointed to Springfield’s mayor, whose LLC rents properties to multi-generational Haitian families, and noted a rise in crime, sexual harassment, and unlicensed driving by migrants. Local women reported being followed in public spaces, but law enforcement often ignored their complaints. Additionally, rising rent costs have displaced many residents, as landlords, sometimes in collaboration with NGOs, prioritize migrant families. Roberts criticized the federal government’s involvement and warned of the broader implications for small American towns overwhelmed by unregulated immigration.  Natalie Winters, again, talked about her dislike of the Republican party.  Caroline Wren criticized the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), led by Mitch McConnell, for its ineffective spending in Republican Senate races. She highlighted SLF’s poor track record over the last four election cycles, pointing out that internal polling used by SLF showed questionable data. Wren questioned why, despite this polling, SLF was allocating funds disproportionately to weaker candidates, such as spending millions on Larry Hogan and Bernie Moreno while neglecting stronger contenders like Carrie Lake and Ted Cruz. Wren suggested that SLF’s decisions are politically motivated, particularly to avoid supporting candidates like Cruz and Lake, who oppose funding for the Ukraine war. She also criticized the consultant culture surrounding SLF, particularly figures like Karl Rove, whom she claims have continuously failed yet still influence campaign spending. Ultimately, Wren argued that SLF’s involvement is a "kiss of death” for candidates and that Donald Trump’s success in key states, rather than SLF’s funding decisions, will determine Republican victories in Senate races. She urged people to disregard the recent SLF polling memo and expressed confidence in candidates like Lake and McCormick, expecting them to win alongside Trump.  Brian Schimming, the Wisconsin GOP chair, shared his insights on the state’s role as a critical battleground for the 2024 election. He emphasized the intensity of the race, noting that Kamala Harris’s multiple visits to cities like Milwaukee and Green Bay signal "panic” in her campaign. "Polling shows Wisconsin and other swing states are within two points,” Schimming explained, adding that Trump is currently up by around one to two points in their internal data. Schimming highlighted how Wisconsin’s history of tight races—decided by fewer than 30,000 votes—makes every voter crucial. Trump’s frequent campaign visits, including stops in La Crosse and Wausau, are energizing grassroots efforts, Schimming said, attracting "thousands of people,” even in rural areas. Trump’s push for early voting also stood out. According to Schimming, Trump encouraged Republicans to vote early, explaining it could "save resources” and target persuadable voters. Schimming emphasized the importance of mobilizing non-voters, particularly among conservative groups. "If we can get even a percentage of these people to vote, Trump will win Wisconsin,” Schimming concluded, calling for volunteers to join the GOP’s efforts in the final weeks of the campaign.  Michele Morrow talked about a debate she is participating in tonight in Southern Pines.  Grace Chong delivered a motivational message to the WarRoor audience, focusing on voter registration and participation as the 2024 election nears. She emphasized the importance of mobilizing support in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. "It’s critical to register voters in these final days,” Chong urged, as voter registration deadlines approach. Chong also stressed the significance of early voting, stating, "We must vote early this year, especially in battleground states.” She explained that securing early votes would provide more time to ensure all ballots are counted and help "beat the Democrats at their own game.” Chong recommended several apps to assist with voter mobilization, including the Early Vote Action app and TP Action app. She encouraged the audience to "get out 10 to 20 people a day” and ensure they follow through by voting. She also reminded people to sign up for the WarRoom.org newsletter for updates on grassroots activism and other articles to share with friends. In closing, Chong reminded listeners of Trump’s supporters’ loyalty, stating, "In January 2020, it was the Posse that had President Trump’s back.” She rallied them for the "home stretch,” encouraging them to stay energized and help "close the deal” by getting Trump reelected.  Jenny Holland discusses the alarming influence of corporate media across Western nations, particularly the way media misrepresents events to fit a globalist agenda. She highlights an analysis by Italian journalist Enrico Francescani, who attributed UK riots not to a tragic murder but to Russian trolls and misinformation. Holland, a media professional, found this narrative shocking, noting that it wasn’t limited to American media but echoed across European outlets as well. She points to a growing “transnational media class” that shares more in common with elites abroad than with their own populations. This disconnect leads to biased reporting, especially regarding nationalist movements. Holland cites a case in Ireland where the fiancé of a murdered woman was unfairly portrayed by the media for advocating for prioritizing citizens. She believes this media distortion contributes to social unrest and public frustration across various nations. Holland continues to write about these issues on her Substack.

VIDEO Natalie WInters talked about how the government elite are using an excuse of misinformation being spread on social media to censor people’s speech online. VIDEO VIDEO Jeremy Carl is an author has believes that President Trump needs to be more aggressive in getting the “White vote” claiming that Trump has not focused on White voters. VIDEO Darren Beattie talked about the MacArthur Fellowship awards being given to people for exhibiting radical far-leftist ideology, including DEI. VIDEO Daily Mail correspondent Katelynn Richardson talked about her latest article that exposes the pressure on parents to affirm their children’s transgender ideas. VIDEO Natalie Winters played a video of Rachel Madow reacting to the Vanity Fair article from last week focusing on Steve Bannon.  Winters reacted and said that people should be more like Steve Bannon than Rachel Maddow. VIDEO Lance Wallnau and Dave Brat delivered powerful messages about the intersection of faith and politics. Wallnau highlighted the importance of Christian civic engagement, recounting a recent event at the National Mall where a quarter of a million people gathered, joined by millions online. He stressed, "There is a movement of Awakening that’s happening,” urging pastors to encourage their congregations to vote, lamenting that "31 million evangelicals will sit out the election” due to pastoral reluctance to address political issues. He argued that encouraging just five million votes could make a difference. Wallnau criticized the media for demonizing Christian involvement in politics, particularly their support for Donald Trump. He also emphasized that Christian values align with political action, drawing from Biblical examples like Daniel’s involvement in political affairs under King Cyrus. "If our angel is supporting a heathen… how much more can we stand with Donald Trump?” Wallnau remarked. Dave Brat expanded on this, addressing the theological misconception that Christians should avoid politics. He called this mindset "bad theology,” noting how America’s prosperity allows for such disengagement. Brat reminded listeners of the founding principles rooted in Christianity, adding that early American institutions like Harvard were steeped in religious ideals. Both Wallnau and Brat argued that the separation of church and state is misunderstood, and that Christian engagement is crucial to preserving the nation’s values. VIDEO Steve Soukup argues that corporations, driven by powerful asset management firms like BlackRock, are prioritizing political agendas over their fiduciary responsibilities to investors. He describes this as “unfair” to people who simply want to invest for retirement or run their businesses without political interference. Soukup highlights how companies are pressured to focus on issues like climate change and diversity, which he believes are secondary to investor returns. He points to the influence of asset management giants—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—collectively managing over $20 trillion. These firms, Soukup claims, decide how businesses should operate based on politics rather than financial priorities. “Larry Fink is the most powerful man in the world,” Soukup asserts, criticizing Fink for using clients’ money to advance political agendas. To counter this trend, Soukup emphasizes the need for grassroots action. He suggests building smaller, independent institutions that resist the influence of large asset managers. Soukup believes that only a "revolution from beneath,” inspired by the principles of America’s founders, can reverse the trend. He calls for an awakening in the financial services world to ensure businesses focus on their core mission of serving investors, not politics. VIDEO Mark Paoletta and Dave Brat highlighted the deep state’s overreach and its impact on everyday Americans. Paoletta emphasized the 33rd anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation, noting his importance in standing up against “the left’s vicious attacks.” He praised both Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch for their strong stance on protecting individuals from the overwhelming number of laws and regulations, which Paoletta called a “blizzard of laws…designed to trip you up.” Paoletta discussed Gorsuch’s focus on how bureaucratic overreach affects ordinary people, referencing a fisherman prosecuted under corporate law for throwing fish back into the water, which “destroyed his life.” He criticized the left’s attempts to discredit conservative justices, particularly Gorsuch and Thomas, and underscored the significance of elections in shaping the Supreme Court. With Election Day approaching, Paoletta stressed that “President Trump is winning” and that voters must respond to the “lies on social media” by supporting Trump’s agenda to “secure our border” and “stamp out violent crime.” He concluded by calling the upcoming election “the most important of our lifetime” and expressed confidence that Trump would win comfortably. VIDEO Grace Chong talked about the process of ballot chasing and said that Steve Bannon sent a message from prison that he wants everyone to work like they are 10 points down.

Natalie Winters discredited former Rep. Liz Cheney for her disruptive actions while she was on the J6 Committee and acting in unethical ways with witnesses.  eff Clark discusses legal concerns surrounding Liz Cheney’s interactions with Cassidy Hutchinson during her representation by attorney Stefan Passantino, suggesting possible legal implications for those involved. He criticizes Cheney’s approach as unethical, claiming that Cheney was involved in secret meetings to prepare Hutchinson’s testimony, which he finds ironic and hypocritical, given Cheney’s past positions. Clark emphasizes that if political dynamics shift, figures like Jack Smith may rely on "prosecutorial immunity” to defend themselves, further adding irony since Smith argued against immunity for Trump. Clark also touches on a broader issue of “weaponized” bar complaints and character assassinations, particularly aimed at Hutchinson’s former lawyer. He expresses disbelief that Passantino would coach Hutchinson to lie, suggesting that her claims against him reflect a deeper ethical problem. He criticizes the media and legal establishment for what he sees as a hypocritical double standard, particularly in relation to Cheney’s conduct. Finally, Clark argues that President Trump’s requests for key documents related to election interference are crucial to his defense but are being improperly restricted by the courts, undermining due process rights.  Jack Posobiec, on Steve Bannon’s War Room, shared his observations about Kamala Harris’s campaign struggles in Pennsylvania. He noted that Harris is failing to engage with local leaders and union members, especially in critical areas like Philadelphia. He contrasted this with Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign, where Obama built independent structures to gain local support. Posobiec criticized Harris’s campaign manager, Nikki Loud, as being out of touch with the ground realities. He also highlighted growing frustrations in Philadelphia over crime and drug issues, with people demanding action. Posobiec further speculated that Harris’s lack of attention to the ground game could signal potential ballot fraud operations. He raised concerns about irregularities in Michigan, citing an imbalance between registered voters and actual citizens in some cities, which he attributes to poor election practices. Posobiec’s discussion underscores a broader worry about the integrity of future elections.  Jonathan Kepperman discussed the FBI’s recent revision of crime statistics and criticized the Biden administration for downplaying rising crime. He pointed out that although the administration claimed crime had decreased by 5.8%, more comprehensive data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed a significant 55% rise in violent crime over the last three years. Kepperman expressed frustration, stating that “people see what’s in front of them,” and accused the government of gaslighting the public about crime, inflation, and immigration. He emphasized that “people are fed up with being lied to” and are increasingly aware of the reality, even if they don’t discuss it openly with their peers. Kepperman called for systemic changes, including “mass deportation” and a “complete overhaul at the FBI,” to address these issues. He urged listeners to follow his work at Passage Press and stay informed on the real crime statistics.  Eli Crane provided an update on Donald Trump’s strong polling lead, noting Trump is 20 points ahead in the betting markets. Crane emphasized that "everything is to play for” as the election approaches, especially in battleground states like Arizona. He expressed disappointment with a recent ruling by a Biden-appointed judge preventing measures to ensure that only legal citizens vote before the election. Crane criticized this decision, saying, "the border is wide open” and suggested that allowing illegal immigrants to vote is part of a broader strategy. He mentioned efforts to challenge election practices, referencing work with figures like Greg Phillips from “2000 Mules.” Crane urged transparency in the election process, encouraging citizens to record any suspicious activity at polling stations. He also highlighted the importance of supporting candidates like Justin Heap, who is fighting to clean up Arizona’s election system, and praised Trump’s momentum in Arizona, noting the energy at recent rallies.  Noah Formica has been actively registering voters across Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. "I have registered 2,750 voters here in the state of Pennsylvania for Donald Trump,” he reported, while traveling across the state. He emphasized the importance of vigilance regarding drop boxes, advising caution since it’s challenging to regulate who uses them. Formica supports Trump’s push for early in-person voting to ensure transparency. Trump is making multiple appearances in Pennsylvania before the voter registration deadline on the 21st, including events in Pittsburgh. Formica highlighted efforts to capitalize on these rallies and encouraged supporters to volunteer, even beyond voter registration, by knocking on doors and making phone calls. For those wanting to assist, Formica directed them to contact him via Twitter (@nformicaGOP) or through the website dpaction.com. “We’ve got to pull out all the stops,” he stressed, urging grassroots participation to maximize voter turnout for Trump.  Salleigh Grubbs, chair of Cobb County GOP in Georgia, expressed concern over recent rulings about election procedures, calling the media’s portrayal “propaganda.” She criticized a Superior Court decision requiring immediate certification of election results despite ongoing Republican efforts to combat voter fraud. “It saddens me,” she said, noting issues like ballots stuck in scanners that inflate vote counts. Grubbs defended the proposed election rules, arguing that they align with Georgia’s legislative acts and are necessary to ensure integrity. “These proposals are common sense,” she insisted, countering claims that the timing of rule changes would cause administrative chaos. She blamed the delays on “previous members of the election board who refused to do their job.” Despite the late introduction of these rules, Grubbs emphasized that the current board members are working diligently to secure fair elections in Georgia, stating that “reasonable members” are now in place to restore trust in the process.  Sophie Georges discussed how minorities fared better under the Trump administration compared to the current one, particularly in homeownership. She highlighted that “the policies during the Trump Administration were beneficial for all Americans,” noting that low inflation and low mortgage rates, around 2%, made homes more affordable. During 2017-2021, homeownership rates increased for Latinos by 4%, Asians by 3%, and Blacks by 2%. In contrast, current high inflation and mortgage rates, now over 6%, have disproportionately harmed ethnic minorities, pushing many into affordable housing categories. Georges noted that “people who were middle class have now fallen into that affordable housing qualifying category” due to rising home prices and a housing shortage. She emphasized that the issue isn’t just policy but competent management of the economy, explaining that “empowerment of people” through homeownership is key to building wealth. Current economic conditions, she added, are creating significant financial strain, especially for retirees who “are hanging by a thread.” Georges shared her research on her website, realsafyrealestate.com, to provide valuable insights on these issues.

Natalie Winters highlights the National Pulse article with Steve Bannons complete statement from prison regarding his incarceration.  Natalie Winters comments on the influx of unvetted Chinese nationals entering the U.S., highlighting that around 60,000 have entered in the past 18 months, with many passing through the southern border. She points out that these Chinese migrants are not typical immigrants but are from the wealthy and elite classes. Winters suggests that they are well-funded, possibly even supported by the Chinese government, and are not living in the U.S. as low-wage workers like many other migrants. Instead, they are affluent professionals, raising concerns about their motivations and the lack of thorough vetting.  Dan Fleuette and Natalie Winters discuss Fleuette’s long association with Steve Bannon. Fleuette has worked with him for over 20 years, starting with a 2003 documentary. Fleuette has been involved in various media projects with Bannon, including graphic novels and documentaries, and continues collaborating with WarRoom Films. He expresses frustration over Bannon’s legal challenges, labeling his imprisonment unjust and a result of a two-tier justice system targeting political opponents. Fleuette highlights the broader issue of "lawfare,” where government power is allegedly used against dissenting voices. The conversation shifts to Fleuette’s latest project, Rebels, Rouges, and Outlaws, a pictorial history featuring portraits, stories, and observations. Fleuette shares his excitement about the project, revealing that Winters is featured in the book, complimenting her on her growth in the media space. He humorously notes that Winters is starting to resemble Bannon in her work, implying her increasing influence in political commentary.  Todd Bensman and Natalie Winters discuss the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, focusing on the influx of migrants, including a significant number of wealthy Chinese nationals. Bensman highlights that many immigrants are closely watching the U.S. elections, fearing a potential Trump victory, which they believe would shut down the border, prompting them to rush into the U.S. He notes that wealthy Chinese immigrants, unlike others, can afford cartel passage due to their financial resources, possibly backed by the Chinese government. Additionally, Bensman observes an influx of migrants from across Asia, Africa, and beyond, turning border towns like Tapachula, Mexico, into overcrowded "pressure cookers” filled with people waiting to cross into the U.S. The Biden administration’s CBP One mobile app allows some to secure appointments for border entry, easing pressure in these towns. Bensman emphasizes the chaotic nature of the situation, with migrants flooding in from around the globe, creating a complex humanitarian and political challenge.  In the discussion between Natalie Winters and Nate Hochman, they talk about the impact of mass immigration on small towns like Charleroi, Pennsylvania, which has seen a significant influx of Haitian immigrants. Hochman a senior advisor for America 2100, describes how Charleroi, a de-industrialized town with just over 4,000 native residents, has been overwhelmed by a 1,500% increase in foreign population since 2020. He emphasizes that the local residents were never consulted about this massive demographic shift, which he describes as part of a broader pattern of small, conservative towns being overwhelmed by immigration, driven by a combination of government programs, NGOs, and big business interests. Hochman suggests that this mass migration is coordinated and punishes these communities for their conservative, pro-America values. He also discusses how the media has downplayed or fact-checked these claims, often relying on a few handpicked activists to dispute the scale of the problem. Hochman and Winters agree that the transformation of these towns has led to significant tensions, with overwhelmed school districts, housing shortages, and strained local resources, yet media coverage often portrays these communities as resistant without addressing the real issues they face.  Joe Allen, standing in for Steve Bannon on War Room, discusses the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its psychological impact on society. He emphasizes that AI has evolved to the point where it can communicate with humans in ways that create the illusion of an entity on the other side. Allen points out that AI systems can now organize and relay information independently, but the real concern is the growing number of people who turn to AI for truth, even on spiritual matters. He cites predictions that AI could give rise to new religions and influence spiritual beliefs. Allen also highlights the political divide surrounding AI, with figures like Sam Altman and Eric Schmidt aligned with the left, while Elon Musk and Peter Thiel lean right. However, Allen stresses that the future will be shaped more by technology than politics, noting that politicians will have to grapple with difficult decisions related to AI and its power. Ultimately, he views this as a spiritual war, with political power secondary to higher, divine guidance.  In their discussion, Noor Bin Ladin and Joe Allen delve into concerns about the “intelligent age” and its technological advancements, particularly as framed by elites like Klaus Schwab and tech figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Bin Ladin praises Allen’s critique of this new era and expresses distrust toward the “progress” being driven by these elites, noting that what they view as a utopia could become a dystopia for the rest of society. She emphasizes that these technological changes often benefit a few while negatively impacting the broader population. While Altman and others seem excited about the digital future, Bin Ladin remains skeptical and concerned about the societal consequences. Despite her reservations about technology’s impact, she remains optimistic, grounded in her belief in God and the human spirit, which she believes will help people overcome the challenges ahead.  Grace Chong emphasized the importance of early voting, urging viewers to participate and mobilize others, while acknowledging that some may prefer voting on election day. Joe Allen confirms he is registered but hasn’t voted yet, expressing his commitment to voting his conscience. He praises Chong for her motivation and energy in rallying the supporters, encouraging everyone to remain positive and focused on achieving victory in the upcoming election. The discussion reflects a sense of urgency and excitement among Trump supporters as they push for turnout in the 2024 election.  In their discussion, Joe Allen and Jennifer Billek delve into the themes of Billek’s book, Transsual: Transgender Transhuman. Billek emphasizes that transgenderism and transhumanism are not merely identities but efforts to redefine humanity through technology. She argues that these movements aim to alter societal perceptions of sexuality, detaching them from biological realities and promoting a synthetic view of identity. Billek critiques the portrayal of these ideologies as organic human rights movements, suggesting instead that they are financially backed by powerful figures and organizations, such as the Pritzker family and Martin Rothblatt, who seek to reshape societal norms. She highlights the potential dangers of such changes, particularly for women, who play a crucial role in reproduction. The conversation underscores concern over how these technological ambitions might undermine the traditional understanding of gender and humanity.

Mike Davis described the legal challenges against President Trump as a coordinated effort to obstruct his election campaign, calling it “election obstruction.” He emphasized that Trump has faced severe financial and legal pressure, saying, “They’ve tried to bankrupt him” and “indicted him four times.” Davis also mentioned underfunding Trump’s Secret Service protection, nearly putting his life at risk. He criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith’s actions as politically motivated, describing the release of “165 paid political documents” just before the 2024 election as “highly unusual” and “unprecedented.” Davis argued that this one-sided narrative amounts to a “political assassination” orchestrated by Democrats, including Kamala Harris, due to fear of Trump’s potential victory. He urged Trump supporters to vote early, warning that this is the latest attempt to interfere with the election.  Sam Faddis expressed strong concerns about an individual with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), describing the situation as alarming. He noted that this person has had decades-long connections with China, frequently traveling there and organizing trips for students, some of which were funded by the CCP. Faddis criticized the lack of transparency around these trips, stating, “He has been… reluctant or simply refuse[d] to provide any detail.” Faddis suggested that if the trips weren’t CCP-funded, the individual would likely be more forthcoming. He also pointed out that the individual wasn’t advocating for democracy in China, which the CCP wouldn’t allow, but was instead praising communism and its ideals. Faddis argued that such close involvement with the CCP raises significant concerns, asserting that this person “shouldn’t come within 10 miles of the vice president’s office.”  Natalie Winters talks about a letter from Adam Shiff.  Jonathan Keeperman criticized conservatives who oppose Trump on moral grounds, labeling them as “cowards” using excuses to avoid supporting policies necessary to “save this country.” He referenced Stephen Miller’s revelation that 500,000 Haitians were flown into the U.S. through a loophole created by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, noting that “nobody asked for this” except a few special interest groups. Keeperman argued that fake conservatives lack the political courage to address this issue and send these individuals back. He praised JD Vance’s debate performance for embracing “Bannonism” and returning to an “America First policy” that prioritizes American interests. Keeperman noted that anyone speaking honestly about such topics would become a target, but highlighted the need for leaders who can focus on critical issues, such as Ukraine and Iran, while also putting Americans first.  Missouri Senator Nick Schroer expressed concerns about rising crime linked to illegal immigration and drug cartels in the St. Louis area. He highlighted the influence of gangs like the Black Mafia Family, which are spreading fentanyl, cocaine, and meth, and criticized the city’s mayor for being connected to a cartel-affiliated individual while doing little to address violent crime. Schroer noted that crime is spreading into suburban areas, including his district, O’Fallon, Missouri, one of the safest small cities in America. He shared alarming incidents involving illegal immigrants, including two stabbings, a police officer being run over, and a murder by Honduran nationals. Schroer criticized ICE for failing to deport known criminals, resulting in tragic outcomes. He emphasized that Missouri has become a “border state” and warned about the erosion of the American dream, advocating for “Freedom Fighters” like himself to stand up and protect citizens’ way of life.  Ben Bergquam commented on the growing issue of illegal immigration, focusing on large numbers of immigrants, especially from Venezuela, Haiti, and other countries, being relocated to cities like Cincinnati and Springfield. He highlighted how these communities are overwhelmed by the influx, with resources strained and local citizens neglected in favor of cheap labor. Bergquam criticized big industries and staffing companies for prioritizing cheaper immigrant labor, contributing to job shortages for American citizens in already struggling areas hit by the decline in steel manufacturing and the fentanyl epidemic. He also emphasized the cultural disconnect and rising crime, such as vehicular accidents. According to Bergquam, local leaders, including mayors, profit from this crisis while ordinary citizens suffer. He argued that this situation is emblematic of a broader national issue, with populist interests being sacrificed for corporate profits, a key theme he sees influencing the 2024 election.  Dave Brat opened the conversation on “War Room” by honoring Steve Bannon and praying for his return, emphasizing his leadership in the grassroots movement. Brat then welcomed Matt Boyle, discussing the lack of mainstream media coverage on the recent debate, especially in outlets like Drudge, New York Times, and Bloomberg. Boyle noted that JD Vance won the debate convincingly, while his opponent, Tim Ryan, struggled, particularly when defending Kamala Harris’ record and making gaffes about school shooters and the administration. Matt Boyle highlighted Vance’s skill at the Vice President’s debate on Tuesday in connecting immigration to economic and social issues, which resonated with voters. He praised Vance’s strong performance and noted that Trump’s judgment in backing Vance demonstrated his ability to pick strong candidates despite opposition from the establishment. They discussed the top voter concerns: inflation, immigration, and public safety, while also noting how abortion and healthcare have dropped in importance since the 2022 elections. Boyle praised Vance for handling traditionally Democratic issues well, turning them into strengths. The conversation ended with predictions of October surprises, including a longshoreman strike, national disasters, and escalating global tensions, which could impact the upcoming election.  Dave Brat and Ralph Reed praised JD Vance’s debate performance, highlighting Vance as “one of the brightest” and “a gentleman” who effectively addressed key issues like the economy, inflation, and crime. Reed criticized Tim Ryan for defending a “failed administration” amidst crises such as missile attacks on Israel and border issues. Reed noted the mainstream media’s predictable attempts to shift focus to less relevant topics, like January 6th. Reed also provided an update on door-knocking efforts, with 417,214 doors reached in Pennsylvania and 4 million nationwide. He predicted Evangelical voters will turn out in record numbers, and Vance is poised to secure both the Evangelical and Catholic votes.  Grace Chong issued a rallying cry for the Warren Posse, urging members to engage actively in the upcoming elections by reaching out to 10 to 20 people daily in critical battleground states. She highlighted the importance of using the Early Vote Action and TP Action apps to facilitate calls, texts, and postcard campaigns for voter registration. Chong emphasized the urgency of this mission with just 34 days left until the election, calling on members to take personal responsibility and make a commitment to participate every day to ensure voter turnout and mobilize support effectively  Eric Teetsel, the new Executive Vice President of the Center for Renewing America, discussed his role and the organization’s goals with Dave Bratt. Teetsel emphasized that America has untapped potential and expressed hope for improvement. Reflecting on a recent debate, he described it as “the singular most dominant debate performance” and praised Senator Vance for his brilliance and readiness to lead, contrasting him with Mr. Waltz’s lackluster presentation. The discussion shifted to critical issues, including the economy, border security, and international relations. Teetsel noted, “For a long time now, we have made policy choices… that may work for a certain class of society,” indicating that average Americans have been neglected. He highlighted the importance of tariffs, specifically those proposed by President Trump, as tools for economic revitalization, stating, “We have to make different choices to prevent that from happening” regarding threats from China. Teetsel also called attention to the need for a paradigm shift in policies to better serve national interests and stressed that the fight against the "Deep State” remains crucial. He acknowledged the leadership of Russ Vought, noting his dedication and experience. Teetsel encouraged listeners to connect with the Center for Renewing America and mentioned his podcast, which takes a faith-based approach to current events.

Salleigh Grubbs highlighted growing momentum for Donald Trump, emphasizing high voter turnout in recent elections and record-breaking participation, particularly among lower-propensity Republican voters. Despite not having specific early voting data, Grubbs noted that feedback from poll watchers across Cobb County has been positive, suggesting strong Republican performance. Grubbs shifted focus to ongoing legal challenges in Georgia, mentioning over 85 cases against the Secretary of State. A significant case involves Eternal Vigilance Action, targeting seven rules passed by the Georgia State Election Board. A recent ruling by Judge Cox in Fulton County blocked these rules, potentially impacting the upcoming election. Grubbs emphasized the importance of these rules, specifically those related to ballot counting, which the opposition sought to eliminate. She stressed that the opposition claims to be Republican but acts against what she considers "common-sense” rules. In response, the Georgia GOP and the RNC filed an appeal, with Grubbs submitting a strong amicus brief. She expressed hope that the Supreme Court will issue an expedited, favorable ruling to ensure these election rules are reinstated. Grubbs called for persistence, urging supporters to continue the legal battle to secure fair election processes in Georgia.  Natalie Winters talked about her feelings about Liz Cheney.  Maureen Bannon discusses the details of the First Step Act request filed by her Dad’s legal team in August that was denied just recently.

Mike Davis repeats his story about President Trump’s need to start a criminal probe as soon as possible into the tactics and actions of the administrative state and the Intelligence community.  Ben Harnwell interviewed Michelle Morrow, who is running for office in North Carolina.  Erin Joyce discusses the election in Virginia and her observations on low-propensity voters there. She says it looks good for Trump and other down-ballot races.  Sabin Howard is a Populist Artist who has discussed the history of sculptures and art in the United States. He recently finished a long-term project on World War One. Howard has a unique philosophy about power in art and the need to return to the tenets of Western Civilization in culture and art.  Brandon Showalter and Ben Harnwell’s discussion focuses on the spiritual and moral battles they perceive in current events, both globally and in the U.S. Showalter highlights a “stark contrast between spiritual evil and good,” citing recent public displays he views as demonic, including a controversial event in Georgia and the 2024 Olympics in France, which he believes mocked Christian symbols. He references Biblical teachings on spiritual warfare, emphasizing the power of Christian prayer to combat such perceived evil. Harnwell adds context with a legal battle in Alabama. He explains that the state’s restrictions on gender-affirming treatments for minors have reached the Supreme Court. Alabama’s law, one of the strictest, criminalizes certain medical procedures for children, and the ensuing legal disputes have uncovered what Showalter describes as disturbing activism within influential health organizations, including allegations involving Rachel Levine at the Department of Health and Human Services. The discovery phase has revealed the involvement of prominent activists in shaping healthcare guidelines, further fueling the controversy. Both Showalter and Harnwell underscore the intensity of the moral and political conflicts, with a particular emphasis on prayer and legal measures as means to uphold their views of Christian values.

Eric Underwood highlighted Nebraska’s early voting situation and its critical importance this election cycle. He emphasized that voters still have time to register in person until 11:59 p.m. this Friday at election commission offices or county clerk locations. “We’re seeing an amazing amount of early vote turnout,” he noted, underscoring increased in-person participation. The stakes are high, with both Senate seats up for grabs due to Senator Ricketts finishing Senator Sasse’s term and Senator Deb Fischer seeking re-election. Underwood pointed out Nebraska’s pivotal Second Congressional District, which holds a unique electoral vote that could determine the presidential race: "This could be the determination of whether or not you have President Trump in or you have four more years of Biden.” He expressed confidence in the district going “2016 red,” highlighting a robust ground game targeting low-propensity voters. Nebraska has seen a notable shift in voter registration, with the Republican base growing.

Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts and ideas about Election integrity topics and how Democrats have been responsible for imprisioning numerous supporters of President Trump.  Jim Womack talked about his Election Integrity fundraiser, some of the cases he follows and promotes media interest in, and the media coverage of elections.  Grace Chong read her article from the other day again and discussed Steve’s statement regarding the First Step Act.  She also encouraged the audience to write out postcards for Get Out The Vote efforts.  Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts and feelings about what she calls the Deep State and the Deep State Generals, and she says that they do not support the America First Agenda.  Colin Aamot talked about his frustration that the House Oversight Committee appears to be ignoring some documents that highlight the connections between the Democrat Vice President candidate and his association with the Chinese Communist Party.  Natalie Winters discussed her thoughts and feelings about how a managerial class must get rich by destroying the United States of America.  Darren Beattie talked about the various news organizations and their endorsements or lack of endorsements and said that he felt Joe Biden should endorse Donald Trump.  Karen Sidgemund highlighted the American Freedom Alliance’s recent initiatives, emphasizing efforts to raise awareness about critical security threats. She mentioned past events, including “World War III: The Early Years,” which began in Los Angeles with Steve Bannon’s support. These events have been ongoing, with the latest held in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and available on their Rumble channel due to YouTube’s restrictions. “YouTube can be quite finicky when you address actual reality,” she noted, pointing to censorship challenges. Sidgemund stressed the importance of informed voting, saying their aim is to combat misinformation and provide “true information about the threats” that America faces. Upcoming efforts will focus on disseminating concise video clips to reach broader audiences. According to her, the initiative is about preserving freedoms and protecting the constitutional republic, highlighting that “this is not about politics, it’s about policies.” She encouraged supporters to visit their website, AmericanFreedomAlliance.org, and follow their Rumble and social media platforms for the latest updates. Sidgemund’s mission is clear: to inform the public so they vote from an “informed perspective” rather than being misled by disinformation. Retired U.S. Navy Captain James Fanell, a former senior naval intelligence officer, shared his concerns regarding recent remarks by retired Generals John Kelly and Mark Milley about former President Trump. Fanell, co-author of “Embracing Communist China: America’s Greatest Strategic Failure,” emphasized the seriousness of their statements. He criticized these former military leaders, saying their public accusations, including references to Trump as a “fascist,” breach military ethics. According to Fanell, such behavior undermines the oath they took to defend the Constitution and the principle of civilian control over the military: "They should have formally resigned while they were in office,” if they had such concerns, he asserted. Fanell expressed disappointment with General Milley’s actions, labeling him “arrogant” and an “elitist,” especially given Milley’s lucrative post-retirement roles tied to defense firms. He contrasted this with the integrity shown by past military figures who maintained neutrality, such as George Marshall, who famously refrained from voting to preserve military professionalism. As the conversation transitioned to international concerns, Fanell noted the aggressive behavior of the People’s Republic of China, highlighting its strategic threats to U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region. He urged Americans to reflect on these global challenges when considering their choices in the upcoming election.  Colonel Derek Harvey examined escalating threats posed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and criticized the military leadership of figures like General Milley. Harvey emphasized that the current geopolitical climate is far worse than it was four years ago, stating, "We can say without a doubt that we’re worse off today.” He pointed out recent aggressive maneuvers by China, including the "joint sword 2024 Bravo” exercises, which involved 153 aircraft sorties aimed at testing a blockade of Taiwan. He noted that on one day, China conducted 140 sorties, a significant increase from previous years. "This is a dangerous time,” he warned, highlighting the growing threats in the South China Sea and China’s harassment of Indonesian operations. Colonel Harvey expressed disappointment in military leaders like Milley, stating, "Generals like Milley and Kelly have not been focused on winning.” He criticized them for their political ties, claiming their actions have been influenced by the "authoritarian left.” Harvey warned that the real threats stem from the "weaponization of the DOJ and the FBI,” which he deemed a form of fascism. Furthermore, he expressed concern over Israel’s trust in the U.S. amid rising tensions with Iran. "The United States cannot be trusted by Israel,” he asserted, citing systemic issues within the current administration that view Iran favorably while regarding Israel as the problem. Harvey’s insights underscore the complex interplay of global threats and military leadership inadequacies.

Gavin Wax and Steve Bannon discussed the Trump campaign’s momentum and New York City’s strategic role in the 2024 election. Wax observed a noticeable lack of energy from the left in NYC, describing a "defeatism going through the ranks” compared to past years of vocal opposition, which he sees as a shift in favor of the populist right. Wax and Bannon believe Trump’s focus on winning over diverse, working-class demographics—including Black and Hispanic voters—is resonating well, especially with his New York energy and style. Wax notes that Trump’s appeal goes beyond policy, connecting with low-propensity voters who have felt overlooked by traditional GOP outreach. Highlighting the New York Young Republicans Club’s role in these efforts, Wax shared their extensive grassroots activities, like door-knocking and phone banking across NYC and swing counties, which he believes are vital to expanding populism’s influence. The conversation concluded with excitement about their upcoming gala, which Wax called "the event of the year,” aiming to celebrate populism and build support for the ongoing political movement. TICKETS  Eric Metaxas, with Steve Bannon, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the media’s hostile treatment of Bannon. Metaxas shared his shock at the overt disdain journalists showed, stating, “The level of hostility was utterly despicable.” He described the media as “pampered perfumed fools,” noting they acted more like “the information Warfare Department of the political class” rather than impartial truth-seekers. Bannon and Metaxas agreed that mainstream journalists no longer seek objectivity, calling it a display of contempt for Americans and “team reality.” Bannon remarked that such media hostility reflects the broader, combative state of American politics, which he labeled a "blood sport.” Metaxas, a Yale classmate of Wolf’s, noted his disillusionment, saying he avoids journalists as they "disgust [him] so profoundly.” Despite this, he observed the experience was “horrifying” and emblematic of the societal divide, as he, Bannon, and Wolf—former ideological opposites—have united in pursuit of “what is real and what is true.”  Steve Bannon and Naomi Wolf explored populist themes, personal freedoms, and political unity, challenging the usual labels applied to populist movements. Bannon argued that populism represents a diverse America, with people across races and religions engaging, despite attempts to label these gatherings as “fascist.” Wolf, recalling her own experience, said Bannon’s platform allowed her to warn the public about potential health risks associated with the mRNA vaccine, despite censorship she faced. "Instead of helping women protect their fertility, they lifted [my warnings] out to silence me,” she said, adding that Bannon’s audience provided essential support. Wolf praised Trump for building what she described as a “unity party,” aligning with figures like RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Elon Musk, emphasizing that Trump’s coalition now speaks to concerns across demographics: “black people, white people, Hispanic people, women, men.” She also acknowledged Bannon’s role in producing the “Pfizer Papers,” a report revealing alleged vaccine harms, which Wolf says was key in sharing information the government wanted hidden. Bannon emphasized the importance of grassroots support, particularly as November approaches, with projects like Daily Clout providing tools for voter transparency. He also mentioned that Wolf’s work has become integral to his campaign, even accessible to inmates at his correctional facility. Wolf urged continued support, highlighting the role of platforms like War Room in "moving the needle.”  Natalie Winters summarized Steve Bannon’s Press conference earlier on Tuesday.  You can read our coverage of that press conference:  Bannon’s Out, and He’s Not Backing Down: "Dems are Going to Fight Dirty and MAGA Won’t be Silenced”   Monica Crowley talked about the loss of hope in the Population after seeing the Biden-Harris administration in action and said that she believed more and more people were discovering that they saw renewed hope for their situation in President Trump.

Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters examined election-related tensions in Pennsylvania, describing what they called the "chaos” surrounding the 2024 election. Posobiec noted that Trump and his supporters are frustrated by alleged tactics to restrict Republican poll watchers and create complications with mail-in voting. Bannon highlighted a claim by Bill McGinley, a senior election lawyer, who said Republicans are countering issues with mail-in ballots by encouraging voters to hand-deliver ballots to ensure receipt. Winters emphasized that election officials, notably influenced by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), have implemented "election security measures,” which critics argue limit transparency, such as covering windows to obstruct poll watcher views. Posobiec linked these measures to a broader "narrative programming” approach, suggesting that federal and state entities, including the FBI, might be preparing narratives to counter election fraud claims by branding them as foreign disinformation. Bannon and winters argued that this approach serves to delegitimize Republican poll watchers and prime the public for potential delays and security measures that, they believe, primarily restrict MAGA observers. Posobiec also referenced recent issues in Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Michigan, pointing out election software concerns and incidents that he sees as undermining transparency. Bannon suggested these actions represent a fifth-dimensional information warfare against MAGA voters, implying a deep-seated bias in election oversight. Reflecting on this landscape, they urged voters in Pennsylvania to remain vigilant, especially after legal battles in areas like Bucks County led to an extension of voting hours.  Nikki Jam, a renowned musician of Puerto Rican descent, has withdrawn his endorsement of Donald Trump following controversial comments about Puerto Rico made by a comedian at a Trump rally. Despite Trump’s campaign trying to distance itself from these remarks, the incident has led to significant backlash. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a supporter of Trump and of Puerto Rican descent herself, defends Trump, emphasizing that he did not make the offensive remarks and has consistently shown support for the Latino and Hispanic communities. She argues that while the situation is unfortunate, it should not overshadow Trump’s overall record and relationship with these communities. Guilfoyle suggests Trump should continue focusing on his support for these groups and possibly visit Puerto Rico to reaffirm his commitment. She also touches on the broader implications for the election, stressing the importance of voter integrity and the need for Trump to concentrate on battleground states in the final days of the campaign.  Jack Posobiec discussed recent issues regarding alleged election law violations in Pennsylvania, specifically Bucks County, where he claims that officials attempted to shut down voting processes in ways he argues are against the law. He recounted spending time gathering affidavits and videos with lawyers and witnesses to document these instances for a legal challenge. According to Posobiec, a judge ultimately rejected these alleged attempts to limit voting, stating that such actions violated election law. He also pointed out that Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and other Democratic officials have not addressed these claims directly, instead labeling them as "misinformation.” Posobiec encouraged others to document similar occurrences nationwide, asserting that these efforts could replicate the approach taken in Bucks County to monitor and address potential issues in other states as well. He underscored Pennsylvania and Arizona as critical states for ensuring voting transparency in the upcoming election.  Natalie Winters talked about the rising esclations from the Democrats and their tactics to try to win the election.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon got into the economic and political challenges facing the United States. Patrick highlighted concerns about inflation, fiscal policies, and the rising national debt, emphasizing how these factors have placed economic strain on middle-class Americans. He pointed to government spending and Federal Reserve policies as major contributors to inflationary pressures and discussed the potential long-term effects on the economy and U.S. dollar. Bannon, focusing on political dynamics, echoed Patrick’s concerns, arguing that fiscal irresponsibility undermines the nation’s stability. He criticized policymakers for failing to address core economic issues, attributing this inaction to a lack of political will and accountability. Bannon also stressed the importance of economic nationalism, advocating for policies that prioritize American industries and reduce reliance on foreign economies. Both agreed on the need for reform, with Bannon framing the conversation within the broader America First agenda, calling for a grassroots movement to challenge the political establishment. Their discussion painted a picture of urgency, with a shared belief that without significant economic and political change, the U.S. could face deeper systemic issues in the future.  Tyler Bwoyer from Turning Point USA Action shared with Steve Bannon their aggressive voter mobilization efforts in Arizona. Boyer described their work as “kicking butt,” with volunteers working "from sunup to sundown” to reach low-propensity and disengaged Republican voters. Through the “Commit 100” initiative, they aim to turn out voters who haven’t consistently participated in past elections, targeting those identified as likely conservatives. Bowyer explained, "We’ve mobilized folks to chase 100 of the most necessary ballots,” using personalized, community-based approaches similar to Democratic strategies under Obama. Bannon highlighted the importance of this groundwork, especially in early voting, to avoid "cannibalizing” Election Day turnout. Bowyer reassured him, stating, "We’re seeing dramatic results,” adding that Arizona’s high number of mail-in voters aids their tracking of engagement. Both expressed optimism, with Bowyer noting this week as pivotal: "We’re on a good trajectory to turn out the people we need to win.” In closing, Bannon underscored the value of alternative media for informing voters, as mainstream sources often overlook these local mobilization efforts. Part One:  Part Two:  Maureen Banon talked about encouraging people to stand in line to vote, and to have a plan to vote.  Raheem Kassam talked about his point of view about what he sees as a Color Revolution in the Unted States.  Natalie Winters talked about election integrity issues.

Steve Bannon’s recent remarks highlight the War Room’s intense focus on mobilizing voters for upcoming elections, aiming to secure a major victory for the MAGA movement. Positioned in Washington, D.C., near the Capitol, Bannon described the movement’s current state as a battle between grassroots mobilization and established opposition. He criticized what he sees as "delegitimization” efforts reminiscent of tactics used against Trump in 2016 and emphasized the need for supporters to rally in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona to help ensure voting integrity. Bannon called for "mass mobilization” efforts, outlining plans for comprehensive coverage by his team, including appearances from figures like Peter Navarro, Natalie Winters, and Charlie Kirk. He expressed confidence in winning if supporters stay vigilant, particularly with early voting. Stressing the stakes, he compared the current fight to a “match play” contest in golf, where victory hinges on reaching the electoral threshold of 270 votes. This approach, he noted, aligns with the Founding Fathers’ vision of the U.S. as a constitutional republic rather than a simple democracy. Bannon explained that the War Room’s strategy relies on grassroots activism rather than large monetary contributions or media campaigns. He emphasized the role of Christian voters and encouraged faith-based communities to view participation as a moral duty, framing this moment as a "spiritual war.” In Bannon’s view, the stakes are existential, calling for steadfast dedication to the cause to secure a political win and a reclamation of cultural values. The push, he added, is merely the beginning of a larger process in the ongoing populist movement.  Dave Brat’s remarks emphasize the crucial role of mobilizing Christian voters in key states to secure electoral victories. He believes that a strong Christian turnout could tip the scales in places like Arizona and Virginia, aligning with a “match play” strategy to win targeted electoral votes rather than a broad sweep. Brat urges Christian communities to organize by reaching out to their congregational lists, encouraging pastors to send voting reminders, and focusing on economic concerns, the border situation, and religious values. By leveraging grassroots efforts similar to those he used in his own campaign, Brat contends that an active, unified Christian electorate could bring about decisive results. “If we all do that, 100 million folks show up, and it’s game over,” he says, calling for a concerted effort among traditional Christian voters to show up and vote for their values.  Steve Bannon and Scott Presler underscore the urgent push for Republican voter mobilization in key areas, especially Pennsylvania. Bannon lauds Presler as the “Johnny Appleseed” of grassroots voter engagement, crediting him with tireless dedication. Presler highlights efforts in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where Republican turnout is surging and Democrat voter registration is dwindling. He notes that Democrats had “voter protection” groups aimed at limiting Republican voting, leading to an extended early voting period due to a court ruling. The numbers are promising: the Democrat lead of 1.1 million voters in 2020 is now down to 387,000, a significant shift. Presler emphasizes, “We have every metric going in our direction,” but warns against complacency. He stresses the need for outreach across demographics—veterans, hunters, young men and women—and encourages engaging voters at everyday locations like gas stations and supermarkets to ensure everyone has a voting plan. Bannon and Presler both emphasize that this level of mobilization is crucial to victory, with Presler adding, "You vote like your very lives depend on winning this November.” Bannon observes a visible enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans, attributing it to an uncharismatic Democrat candidate. He encourages continued community organizing, asserting, "This is a time to unite black, white, brown, blue-collar… that’s the new populist.” Presler and Bannon’s unified message is clear: relentless grassroots engagement is essential to secure a decisive turnout on Election Day.  Steve Bannon and Breitbart’s Matt Boyle are marking a historic shift as Republicans lead early voting in battleground states like Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada—traditionally Democratic strongholds. For the first time, GOP early voting is up, thanks to outreach efforts that are successfully drawing in "low-propensity” voters who are less likely to withstand long Election Day lines. The GOP’s targeted early turnout in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin is crucial, as flipping even one of these states could pave Trump’s path to victory. Early voting numbers in Pennsylvania show potential Democratic vulnerability, with the GOP gaining ground in traditionally blue regions, aided by a legal win that preserved early voting in Bucks County. Boyle highlights that this surge is largely due to grassroots mobilization by alternative media, social platforms, and influencers like Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk, who have driven a powerful GOTV (Get Out the Vote) effort to rally men and other key demographics to vote early. As Boyle and Bannon emphasize, the GOP’s plan to beat Democrats at their own game of early mobilization has worked, but they urge Republicans to push hard through Election Day, particularly focusing on male voter turnout to cement their gains.   Natalie Winters discussed the importance of election officials counting only the ballots of certifiable legal votes and bypassing illegal votes.  Mike Benz exposes the tactics of censoring the social media posts of Conservatives.  Darren Beattie discusses his coverage on Revolver News of Jamie Raskin objecting to President Trump’s victory after the votes are counted.  Rudy Giuliani passionately emphasized the importance of mobilizing efforts for the upcoming election, urging Americans to stay vigilant and proactive. Reflecting on past elections, Giuliani warned of potential threats, stating, "They tried everything,” referring to alleged attempts to disqualify candidates and influence outcomes. He voiced concerns about extreme actions, cautioning that "they may try to kill you,” while adding, "I wouldn’t exclude that possibility,” drawing on his experience as an investigator. Giuliani advised supporters to get involved by volunteering for the party and organizations like Turning Point, emphasizing that greater turnout and oversight could help secure election integrity. He noted, "The more people we can turn out for inspections, the more frightened they get.” Giuliani encouraged the public to stay engaged, adding, "Don’t sit back; there’s something you can do,” stressing active participation on the days leading up to Election Day.

Steve Bannon and Chris Buskirk discussed turnout efforts in the upcoming election, focusing on mobilizing low and mid-propensity voters who already support Donald Trump but may not have a strong voting history. Their campaign strategy relies on new FEC rules that allow outside groups, like Turnout for America, to collaborate with campaign data, enabling a targeted approach without duplication of effort. This is seen as a game-changer, especially given limited resources. Buskirk explained that their strategy is data-driven, using information on voters’ prior turnout behavior to pinpoint and engage potential supporters. So far, this has proven effective in swing states, with early voting participation reportedly surpassing 2016 and 2020 rates among Trump supporters. Additionally, Bannon and Buskirk contrasted their approach with the Democrats’, who are also trying to mobilize their base but appear to lack enthusiasm among their low-propensity voters. Buskirk emphasized that their success hinges on grassroots efforts and adapting to early voting, a shift from prior GOP habits. The overall message was that this new approach is making a measurable impact on voter engagement, which they believe is crucial to achieving victory  Natalie Winters talked about her investigation into the connections between the Arizona Secretary of State and the person she calls the Colour Revolution Architect.  In this conversation, Caroline Wren and Steve Bannon discuss the high voter turnout among Republicans in Arizona, where GOP early voting has taken a significant lead. Wren attributes this surge to discontent with current administration policies and to grassroots organizing led by Bannon’s "War Room Posse.” She highlights that these efforts have activated local GOP chapters, especially in Arizona, driving a strong turnout. Wren and Bannon then discuss Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake’s polling lead over her Democratic opponents, contrasting this with the lack of support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. They also cover a recent legal development concerning unverified voters in Arizona: a court ruling mandated the release of information on nearly 289,000 voters whose citizenship status was unconfirmed. However, despite America First Legal’s legal victory, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled these individuals cannot be removed from voting rolls. Concerns over potential voter suppression due to long wait times at mass voting centers in Maricopa County were raised, with Wren advising voters to stay in line to ensure their votes are counted.  Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon addressed the economic struggles faced by working-class Americans, citing inflation, rising credit card debt, and high-interest rates. According to Navarro, middle and lower-income Americans are burdened by steep credit card APRs, which reach up to 29%, forcing them into debt for basic necessities. The cost of living is rising, especially with essentials like food and housing, and people are increasingly using credit cards just to get by. Navarro noted that many are “choosing between food on the table and medicine in the cabinet,” and inflation only compounds these issues. They attribute much of this economic stress to what they call “politician error,” arguing that Federal Reserve policies and high interest rates are worsening inflation and mortgage costs. Bannon pointed out that when Trump left office, the ten-year treasury rate was under 1%, but it has since risen, affecting loan rates and economic stability. The two argue that these economic challenges have led working-class Americans to support Trump’s policies, believing his tenure offered better conditions, including tariffs on steel and aluminum to protect U.S. industries. Navarro cited Trump’s actions as beneficial for American manufacturing and job security, especially in areas like Pennsylvania, where industries benefited from protective tariffs. Navarro urged voters to show up in large numbers in the next election to ensure the outcomes reflect public sentiment, emphasizing Trump’s “100 actions in 100 days” if re-elected.  In a conversation with Steve Bannon, Sigal Chattah emphasized the significant strides Republicans have made in Nevada, describing efforts to dismantle the longstanding Democratic "Harry Reid machine” and indicating a promising lead in Republican votes. She highlighted a current 40,000 Republican vote advantage, noting that this lead surpasses Trump’s 2020 loss margin in the state, suggesting potential for a Trump victory in 2024. Chattah discussed extensive ballot-harvesting strategies, including creative initiatives like using Halloween gatherings as opportunities for ballot collection. She explained that early voting was still underway, and efforts to "bank ballots” would continue through Election Day, enabled by Nevada’s 2020 decision to decriminalize ballot harvesting. Bannon praised Chattah and her team’s mobilization and commended their commitment to converting Nevada for Trump. They briefly discussed media attention on Chattah as a potential attorney general pick and the strategy to prioritize securing both the presidency and Congress. Bannon also encouraged followers to stay updated on Chattah’s efforts through her social media. Chattah expressed confidence in delivering Nevada to Trump, citing support from various groups and a well-coordinated ballot-chasing operation.  Natalie Winters talked about how the admin state and the corporate media are pushing for an amendment to the US Constutition in order to stop President Trump from returning to the White House.  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Jeff Clark discuss the legal and political complexities surrounding efforts to prevent Donald Trump from assuming office if re-elected, focusing on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars those who engaged in insurrection from holding office. They highlight a recent Supreme Court decision in Colorado rejecting attempts to remove Trump from the ballot. Clark explains that the justices upheld Trump’s eligibility because barring a presidential candidate in one state could lead to chaos, resulting in inconsistent ballots across states. However, Clark notes that while the ruling was unanimous in Trump’s favor on this basis, the justices were split on broader questions, such as the enforceability of Section 3 and whether a new statute is needed to apply it. Bannon and Clark speculate on Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin’s possible maneuvers, particularly his suggestion that Congress might refuse to certify Trump’s presidency on January 6, 2025, if he is labeled an insurrectionist. This, they argue, could trigger an emergency Supreme Court case. Clark is concerned about potential further indictments from Special Counsel Jack Smith and how these might be leveraged in January if Democrats, led by Hakeem Jeffries in the House, attempt to block Trump. Clark also raises concerns about potential abuses in the voting process, particularly through the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which he claims could be exploited due to lenient residency requirements. Both Bannon and Clark underscore the significance of these legal strategies, arguing that figures like Mark Elias and Raskin are determined to prevent Trump from regaining power through judicial and legislative tactics.  Part Two:  Grace Chong commends the resilience and dedication of the WarRoom audience, supporters who rallied together following the incarceration of Steve Bannon. She describes his imprisonment as a "blessing in disguise,” igniting a sense of urgency and action among the group. Chong encourages continued participation, particularly in support of Joe Kent’s congressional race in Washington’s third district, emphasizing the importance of sending postcards and verifying ballot statuses due to potential issues with mail-in ballots. The recent fire in Clark County, which may have compromised hundreds of ballots, highlights the need for voters to ensure their ballots are accepted. Chong praises JoJo, a key leader in the effort, as well as the team members who kept operations running smoothly. As early voting comes to a close, she underscores the importance of persistence and determination, anticipating potential challenges at the polls. She stresses the need for unity and readiness, urging supporters to press forward through Election Day to achieve victory, which can then be leveraged by allies like Boris Epstein, Jeff Clark, Bill McGinley, and Mike Davis in ongoing efforts.

Steve Kenny, Senior Litigation Counsel at the Republican National Committee (RNC), is central to defending and challenging election laws. Davis notes that Kenny has been pivotal in legal victories, describing him as “the secret weapon” behind Senate Judiciary Committee successes in confirming President Trump’s judges during Davis’ tenure as Chief Counsel. Kenny explains that the RNC is engaged in “the most active litigation docket of any cycle in history,” handling 126 cases across 26 states. Their efforts focus on two main strategies: defending existing election laws from left-wing challenges and proactively filing lawsuits when state officials violate election laws. This shift toward proactive litigation is largely due to the leadership of President Trump and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley. Kenny emphasizes that many Democratic officials refuse to defend election integrity laws, leaving the RNC to step in. He also highlights successes in states like Pennsylvania, where the RNC has defended the requirement for absentee ballots to be signed and dated, calling it a critical tool in preventing voter fraud. He mentions a case where a fraudulent ballot from a deceased voter was detected due to the date requirement, explaining, “It performs a very important voter integrity function.” Election Integrity Battles in Swing States:
Kenny provides updates on key swing states: Pennsylvania: The RNC successfully defended the ballot dating requirement multiple times, and Kenny expects the issue to resurface in upcoming litigation. Michigan: The RNC won against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s attempts to introduce secret instructions that would presume the validity of absentee ballot signatures. Kenny says, “This violates the Michigan Constitution, which requires neutral verification.” Wisconsin: The RNC challenged a policy allowing voters to re-vote by spoiling absentee ballots. They also won lawsuits ensuring Republican representation in nursing homes and poll watcher access. North Carolina: Recent victories include blocking digital student IDs as valid voter IDs and challenging overseas voter regulations that allow individuals who never lived in the state to vote. Georgia: The state has seen the RNC defend several provisions of Senate Bill 202, an election integrity law passed after the 2020 election. Kenny notes, “Nearly all of that law will be in effect for this November.” Arizona: The RNC successfully defended citizenship verification requirements and continues to fight for documentary proof of citizenship in voter registrations. Kenny believes many of these cases will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. Kenny concludes by outlining ongoing legal battles in Nevada, emphasizing that these efforts aim to secure fair elections and ensure that election integrity laws are upheld across the nation.  Maureen Bannon talked about the various voter registration deadlines in various states, and also about the Get Out The Vote Efforts that are necessary to win the ground game for President Trump.  In a discussion between Mike Davis and Mark Lucas from the Article 3 Project, the conversation focuses on preventing non-citizens from voting in key battleground states ahead of the 2024 election. Lucas emphasized that non-citizen voting is a central tactic the left may employ, with Elon Musk highlighting the rising number of illegal migrants. He encouraged War Room listeners to take action through A3P’s website by contacting election officials responsible for verifying citizenship. Lucas pointed out Arizona, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as critical states, with issues like non-citizens possessing driver’s licenses or state IDs. “We know that non-citizens are illegally voting in past elections,” said Lucas, citing examples from Virginia and Texas. He stressed the need for legislation like the “Save American Elections Act” to combat this threat, concluding with a call for the War Room audience to engage in efforts to safeguard the election process.  In this discussion between Mike Davis and Jeff Clark, they reacted to an article by Eli Honig in New York Magazine that criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith and Judge Tanya Chutkan for their handling of Donald Trump’s legal case following the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity. Jeff Clark noted that the original title of the article, “Jack Smith’s October Surprise,” was changed to “Jack Smith’s October Cheap Shot.” He emphasized that Honig, a former prosecutor and frequent critic of Trump, acknowledged Smith’s disregard for legal norms, saying Smith had “abandoned all objectivity” and shredded the Justice Department’s manual, violating Trump’s due process rights. Clark echoed these concerns, describing Smith’s actions as unconstitutional and designed to interfere with the 2024 election by releasing unexamined evidence against Trump. Davis added that this behavior amounts to “jury pool tampering” and “electoral pool tampering.” They discussed how a future Trump administration should reform the Justice Department, including firing Jack Smith and FBI Director Chris Wray, and ensuring that the department focuses on real crime rather than pursuing January 6th participants. Clark highlighted the need to align the DOJ’s role with the president’s authority, in line with constitutional principles.  Natalie Winters highlighted a recent DOD memo that had made changes in definitions about Assassinations.  Lee Smith talked about a recent article of his titled The FBI Entraps Another Fake Assassin and spoke about other groups who are elevating the theory that the men who tried to assassinate President Trump are fake.  Natalie Winters criticizes the response to Hurricane and the Biden-Harris administration’s approach to the suffering of people impacted as being like a Death to America chant.  Kari Bailey-Chapman talked about her concerns that the EV regulations of the Biden and Harris administrations and by the Democrats in general were actually to ban the combustion engine and how their regulations could actually favor governments and groups who are far less eco-friendly than the United States.  Natalie Winters questioned why Deoocart voting groups were not concerned about the voting problems in areas that are damaged by Hurricane Helene last week.  Natalie Winters talked about her continuing theme of why she is frustrated with Republicans and why she believes Republicans do not want President Trump to win the 2024 Presidential election, and she talked about her anger with Speaker Mike Johnson.

Natalie Winters referred to some corporate media reports and their claims that illegals don’t vote.  State Sen. Jake Hoffman talked about what he has seen in his district with Democrats trying to flip the state “blue” to their side and using illegal aliens to vote to help that happen.  Natalie Winters reacts critically to a clip of Andy Weissmann.  Jason Goodman discussed his appearance during the discussion with Andy Weissman (above) and his point of view on what Lawfare is and how it currently impacts politics.  Noor Bin Ladin discussed her experiences with NATO and her theories about the organization’s purpose as a military arm to enforce Globalism.  In a discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell from Rasmussen Reports, they examined the significance of betting markets, particularly PolyMarket, in gauging public perception of the 2024 presidential election. Harnwell noted that Trump’s support has surged in recent betting, leading him by a substantial margin, reflecting public belief that he will win. Mitchell emphasized that while betting markets can fluctuate, polling data is still more reliable. “Polling is more accurate,” Mitchell said, referencing recent Rasmussen data that showed Trump leading by two points in the national popular vote. Mitchell also pointed out that despite left-leaning media narratives, Trump’s lead is becoming undeniable. “At some point, people on the left… are going to have to wake up to the cognitive dissonance,” he stated. He criticized the mainstream media for being slow to report Trump’s gains, suggesting that polling bias might influence their narrative. According to Mitchell, Trump will likely win key swing states like Pennsylvania, with recent data reflecting a growing advantage. Both emphasized that betting markets and polling are converging on the reality that Trump is favored, despite media reluctance to acknowledge it.  Dave Walsh recently discussed Florida’s energy infrastructure, focusing on the challenges posed by the state’s increasing reliance on solar power. He praised linemen working tirelessly to restore power during storms but highlighted flaws in Florida’s energy strategy. According to Walsh, utilities like Duke Energy and FPL are investing billions in solar farms while neglecting reliable energy sources such as gas, nuclear, and coal. "No new gas-fire, combined cycle plants, no new nuclear plants,” Walsh emphasized, criticizing the closure of coal plants and the lack of investment in dependable baseload power. Walsh pointed out that despite massive solar installations, fossil fuel use has increased. "Duke Energy’s fossil fuel utilization is up two percent,” he noted, revealing solar power’s inefficiency in replacing traditional energy sources. Additionally, Walsh expressed concern over the fragmented nature of solar infrastructure, making it harder to maintain during severe weather events like the recent Category 5 hurricane. He also noted that industries dependent on continuous electricity, such as paper mills and steel plants, are ill-served by intermittent solar and wind power. “Solar and wind cannot be the nation’s sole energy source,” Walsh concluded, calling for a shift back to more reliable, continuous power generation methods.   Jim Womack has one of numerous election integrity groups in North Carolina who are concerned about the impact that the damage in Western North Carolina will have on the November election, and he is asking for donations to his group.  Brian Schimming, Chair of the GOP in Wisconsin, praised the recent rally held by Donald Trump in Dodge County, describing the event as highly successful. Schimming noted, “We had well over ten thousand people” in attendance, emphasizing the strong energy and enthusiasm. He observed that the crowd’s intensity felt as though “the election is two days away,” highlighting the excitement for the upcoming election. Schimming shared that people began lining up hours before the rally, with many arriving as early as 6 a.m., showing immense dedication. “There were thousands of cars parked around that airport,” he said, underscoring the scale of the event. One of the key messages from the rally was the importance of early voting. “The biggest banner… was ‘vote early,'” Schimming said, refuting claims that Trump isn’t serious about early voting. Trump stressed the need for early participation, noting that early voting in Wisconsin starts on October 22. Schimming also discussed the economic concerns resonating with Wisconsin voters, tying them to the broader dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration. He remarked, “Kamala Harris has to run away from Joe Biden,” reflecting voter frustration over issues such as the economy, Afghanistan, and the border crisis.  Cliff Mahoney highlighted the extensive efforts underway in Pennsylvania to secure victory in the upcoming election, emphasizing a door-knocking campaign aimed at reaching 500,000 doors. "We’ve nearly hit 200,000 doors,” Mahoney said, confident in their progress. He stressed the importance of fixing the mail-in voting system to win the state, noting that current ballot request numbers favor Republicans. Mahoney described a recent rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as a high-energy event: "The energy in the room…you just don’t see that in the political world.” He believes this election will determine the future of the Republic, asserting, "This is the election that will decide the future.” Comparing mail-in ballot requests to 2020, Mahoney pointed out that Democrats are down 400,000 requests, while Republicans are only down 87,000. He said, "We only lost this state by 80,000 votes,” highlighting the momentum shift. Mahoney expressed optimism about voter enthusiasm, especially among groups traditionally supportive of Democrats, and warned that if Democrats lose, their national viability could be in jeopardy. He encouraged continued efforts to secure victory through targeted voter outreach and ballot chasing, adding that the groundwork laid now is critical to winning Pennsylvania.  Matthew Tragesser highlighted the significant impact of migration policies on Pittsburgh and its suburbs, specifically focusing on the town of Charleroi. He noted that Charleroi has experienced a 2,000% increase in its migrant population over the past two years, a striking statistic considering the town only has around 4,000 residents. According to Tragesser, this surge is causing substantial strain on local resources, including education and public services. Taxpayers are now shouldering an additional financial burden, paying "hundreds of thousands of dollars extra” to accommodate the growing demand for social services and public schools. Tragesser also raised concerns about increased crime and pressure on medical facilities, particularly emergency services, describing the situation as unsustainable for Western Pennsylvania. He linked these local issues to broader national challenges, noting that Pennsylvania’s experience is reflective of what is happening in regions across the country. Tragesser concluded by encouraging viewers to read more about the topic on Fox News and follow his updates on Twitter, where he continues to cover the evolving situation in Pennsylvania and beyond.

Natalie talked about her dismay over a couple of National Headlines and talked about Russian Collusion.  Steve Friend joined Natalie Winters to talk about the actions of the Intel agencies, which appeared to him to be in operations as secret police more than American institutions.  Natalie Winters talked about Mark Zuckerberg’s 2020 Get Out the Vote efforts and how the corporate media discussed his operations, which are very different from how they discuss voter engagement and get-out-the-vote efforts from Republicans- especially how they are reporting Elon Musk’s support for President Trump.  Phillip Patrick discussed the rising cost of living under Joe Biden and the truth about the employment rates being lower than has been reported. Patrick also discussed Bidenonomics and inflation.  Citizen Kane discussed the latest posts, polling, and voter registrations and how they are connected, and they also discussed Kamala Harris’s appearance on The View.  Alex DeGrasse talked about people having a list of 10 people who they believe they can influence and get them to vote.  Alex DeGrasse reminded the audience that turnout is the key, adding that young people are turning toward Trump in large numbers, but they often do not show up to vote.  DeGrasse encouraged people to focus on getting young people out to vote.  Grace Chong talked about signing up for the WarRoom newsletter for JoJo’s articles, which will have links on where to go for grassroots and how to get involved with the election. Those articles, she said, are expected to be posted soon and she encouraged people to pass them around by email once they got the articles.  Chong added that people should be following her social media on X for Steve’s older clips, his general messaging, and inspiration. She also talked about the numerous voter apps that she wants people to engage with, making sure to tell people to vote for Republicans so we can hold the House and get the Senate, adding that turnout is essential. Hence, we need to be optimistic about the election and Republican candidates. Chong said that people should email any questions to JoJo, who will give everyone the “White Glove Treatment to help them get engaged in their local area or with groups she knows about,” adding that since she and JoJo started this email campaign a couple of days ago, there has been a “flood of emails,” noting that there is a lot of excitement and questions from the Possee.

Natalie Winters talks about what she calls the Deep State and their weaponization of government tactics.  Mike Davis talked about his experience working on the US Supreme Court nomination process, specifically during the time of Brett Kavanagh. He pointed out that a recent investigation into Kavanagh, based on Sheldon Whitehouse, is the corporate media spreading misinformation and using lawfare tactics against Kavanagh.  Davis reminds the WarRoom audience that at the time of Kvanagh’s nomination, Davis released a list of things that the Senate could have investigated with Senate investigators and chose not to follow up on.  Liz Harrington told us about the latest developments in Georgia regarding the 2020 election and how fraud and corruption were detected there.   Patty McMurray talked about the importance of a lawsuit aimed at halting the counting of overseas ballots in Michigan, where voters do not have to prove residency or citizenship. She explains that the Michigan GOP and RNC filed this lawsuit against Michigan Secretary of State Jasmine Benson and her Director of Elections, Jonathan Breeder, for giving clerks guidance that allows overseas voters, registered under the UOCAVA designation, to vote without proving they lived in Michigan or the U.S. Some overseas voters, Patty claims, may never have resided in Michigan or the U.S., and yet ballots are distributed to them via email. She notes a significant increase in overseas ballots in 2020, which is not widely reported except by The Gateway Pundit, and expresses frustration over the situation.  Natalie Winters talked about a recent interview of Kamala Harris.  Sam Faddis reviewed Vice President candidate Tim Walz’s numerous connections with the Chinese Communist Party.  Grace Chong revised the final dates for registering to vote. She promoted JoJo’s position of answering questions by email regarding getting out the vote for the Trump campaign. Chong said that JoJo had reported getting many emails asking how to get active for the second day.  In a discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and Capt. Jim Fanell, they address increasing threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Indo-Pacific region under the Biden administration. Col. Fanell highlights key points such as China’s intercontinental ballistic missile test, its aggressive military activities, and its expanding naval presence. These actions, including incursions near Taiwan, Japan, and the Philippines, indicate China’s growing ambition to displace U.S. influence and dominate the region. He also points out strategic losses like the potential turnover of Diego Garcia, which compromises U.S. security. Fanell underscores that these developments significantly degraded national security compared to the Trump era, where the Indo-Pacific was more stable. He emphasizes that China is practicing to strike the U.S. with nuclear weapons and notes their increasing aggression toward Taiwan, Japan, and other U.S. allies. The conversation also touches on the geopolitical importance of Taiwan, especially in the context of chip production and political symbolism. They conclude that China’s actions, including military provocations and political warfare, are part of a broader strategy that is likely to intensify before the U.S. elections, reflecting the CCP’s desire to influence global politics.

Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon laid out a detailed plan for Donald Trump’s potential second term, emphasizing a swift and strategic staffing of key government roles to dismantle the "Deep State.” They criticized open borders, anti-tariff policies, and entrenched politicians who obstructed Trump’s first term. Bannon and Navarro suggested that Trump could use a Senate recess within his first 30 days to make numerous appointments, circumventing bureaucratic delays. They called for an open Senate vote on November 13 to confirm support for Trump-friendly Senate leadership, ensuring cooperation with this plan. Navarro highlighted his article in The Washington Times as a blueprint for Trump’s early-term strategy, which he claimed would allow Trump to make sweeping changes in immigration, energy, and trade policies. Navarro and Bannon urged supporters to demand transparency and accountability from their Senators, framing this as crucial for advancing Trump’s vision. By quickly appointing allies and implementing bold policy reforms, they argue, Trump could counter opposition from establishment Republicans and ensure loyalty within the government.  In this conversation, conservative attorney Mike Davis discusses his call for intense legal scrutiny of figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Special Counsel Jack Smith, who have pursued cases against former President Donald Trump and his allies. Davis expresses a strong desire to hold these figures accountable, suggesting they should undergo rigorous investigations by various government committees and agencies. He asserts that, if they’ve acted lawfully, they should have nothing to fear from such probes. Davis positions his stance as a response to what he sees as political bias and interference by these officials in Trump-related cases, suggesting that their actions represent a coordinated effort by the Biden administration against Trump. Davis also addresses broader issues regarding Senate obstruction during Trump’s term, criticizing Republican senators for not pushing through Trump’s judicial and executive appointments more aggressively. He supports the idea of using recess appointments if necessary, particularly if Democrats attempt to obstruct Trump’s agenda in a potential second term. He notes that forcing Senate members to stay in session rather than allowing long weekends could expedite confirmations.  Steve Bannon talks about President Trump’s cabinet choices so far.   Eric Prince and Steve Bannon engage in a candid discussion on U.S. foreign policy, military spending, and the importance of private sector innovation in government operations. Prince starts by describing his current mission to brief new Republican senators about the global geopolitical situation, emphasizing the need to reduce U.S. military involvement abroad and rely more on private contractors rather than expanding the defense budget. He reflects on the failures of U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, suggesting a leaner, contractor-based approach could have saved resources while stabilizing the country. He criticizes the U.S. military-industrial complex, highlighting the inefficiencies and the high costs of current operations. Drawing on historical examples, he advocates for using contractors to maintain global order at a fraction of the cost of traditional military interventions. Prince also stresses the importance of price discovery and cost transparency in defense spending, citing economist Hayek’s argument that a lack of pricing information leads to inefficient resource allocation. He questions the effectiveness of military strategies, like the U.S. Navy’s current operations in the Red Sea, and stresses the need to rethink traditional approaches to global military presence. The conversation then shifts to the political realm, with Prince offering advice to President Trump’s potential transition team. He underscores the importance of granting recess appointments to bypass bureaucratic delays in staffing the government. He also praises private sector innovation, drawing parallels with Elon Musk’s achievements in space travel, and urges the government to adopt a similar approach to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Bannon expresses support for Prince’s perspective and the importance of streamlining government operations. He mentions a recent political firestorm in the Senate, where some MAGA-aligned senators were voting in ways that didn’t align with their constituents’ expectations. Bannon highlights the need for transparency and public accountability, particularly with regard to Senate leadership votes, and hints at revealing who voted for whom, in line with his broader push for openness and MAGA’s influence in Washington. Part One :  Part Two:  Julie Kelly and Steve Bannon discuss ongoing political issues surrounding the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, and the prosecution of individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Kelly highlights growing support on Capitol Hill for investigating the misconduct of special counsel Jack Smith and his team, particularly regarding the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago. She emphasizes the emotional toll the raid had on Melania Trump and calls for a special counsel to investigate it further. Kelly also criticizes the DOJ for its treatment of January 6th defendants, accusing Washington DC judges of bias and mishandling cases. She expresses outrage at the political motivations behind these prosecutions, linking them to broader efforts to punish Trump supporters. Bannon supports Kelly’s views, particularly regarding the need to dismantle the FBI and investigate those responsible for weaponizing the justice system against Trump allies. Both emphasize the need for retribution against those involved in the persecution of January 6th protesters and individuals like Peter Navarro. Kelly also calls for the public to demand accountability, particularly from Republican senators like John Cornyn, whom she accuses of supporting authoritarian tactics. The conversation underscores their belief that revenge and retribution are necessary for the victims of political persecution.  Natalie Winters talked about the most recent battle for the WarRoom over Senate Republicans and the push for transparency about their leadership vote.  Jeff Clark and Steve Bannon discuss the challenges facing conservative leadership within government institutions, emphasizing the deep state’s resistance to strong Republican leadership. Clark points out that much of the career civil service, particularly at the Department of Justice (DOJ), is predominantly Democrat, making it difficult for Republican presidents to implement their agendas. He highlights the importance of having strong, competent individuals in key legal positions to ensure the integrity of the DOJ. Clark also criticizes the weaponization of the National Security Division under the Biden Administration, which he believes has shifted focus from foreign terrorism to targeting domestic political opponents, including conservatives, which he views as unconstitutional and anti-American. Bannon echoes these sentiments, stressing the need for accountability rather than revenge. He critiques the mainstream narrative of unity pushed by the left, arguing that it often seeks to disarm conservatives while failing to hold their own side accountable. Both Clark and Bannon believe that the government has overreached in its efforts to suppress conservative views, citing examples like the FBI’s involvement in monitoring school board meetings. In a broader political context, Clark discusses President Trump’s push for recess appointments, arguing that Senate maneuvers to block such appointments contradict the constitutional framework. He supports Trump’s efforts to assert his mandate and governance powers. Both men emphasize the importance of returning to a constitutional government, with Clark encouraging people to follow his work at the Center for Renewing America.

Natalie Winters talked about an Atlanta article that now condones the idea of a Deep State cling. It protects important career bureaucrats.  Natalie Winters exposes Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was found in contempt of Congress but not required to be punished for his hypocrisy toward Steve Bannon and demanding he be imprisoned.  Phillip Patrick outlined the problems with Bidenonmcs and the issues President Trump faces in his new administration.  Mike Benz talks about the censorship tactics he believes will be used to target supporters of President Trump.  Natalie Winters uses humor to address the very large number of supposed Democratic voters who Supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election but did not vote in the 2024 election.  Steve Bannon reacted with satisfaction to a video of Democratic strategist James Carville expressing anger at the Democratic Party’s losses, saying Carville’s frustrations highlighted the party’s failure to address issues like public safety and an "identity disaster.” Bannon emphasized that Carville’s comments reveal the Democrats’ weakening power, contrasting it with what he sees as a "total and complete” control held by the MAGA movement and Republicans in government. Bannon called for Republicans to protect their power by blocking Democratic judicial appointments, preparing for transitions in government leadership, and gearing up to confront the "Deep State” in the executive branch. He credited grassroots efforts for this success, including precinct strategies and volunteer work that helped turn the tide, particularly when official Republican resources were low. Bannon encouraged his audience to learn from Carville’s frustrations, playfully suggesting he might replay the clip, alongside other MSNBC coverage, to emphasize the Democrats’ "crushing defeat.” He concluded by pointing out that the Republican movement, though often underestimated, has now emerged as the dominant force.  Steve Stern and Steve Bannon discussed their grassroots strategy to empower the America First movement through local and state election integrity efforts.

In this exchange between Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell, they discuss the shifting political landscape in Europe and the growing influence of populist-nationalist movements. Bannon critiques the European political class, especially the elites in Brussels and NATO, who once thought President Trump and populism were finished, but now, with the rise of support for such movements, they are eager to reconnect. Both Bannon and Harnwell reflect on how their phones are now flooded with messages from people who had previously distanced themselves. Harnwell highlights the changing attitudes towards Trump, noting that even the UK is considering granting him a second state visit, showing the shift in global dynamics. They also touch on European issues, such as the Netherlands’ efforts to tackle migration and Italy’s increasing support for American-style populism, with people there looking to leaders like Trump for guidance. Bannon emphasizes the importance of delivering for the people, whether in or out of power, and stresses that the so-called “retribution” against corrupt elites is not about Trump but about representing the will of the American people. They conclude with a discussion on the ongoing fight against the political establishment, underscoring the rise of populism as a force for change.

Steve Bannon passionately outlined the appointments and vision of the incoming Trump administration, emphasizing the selection of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. He praised Gaetz as a fierce, relentless warrior, referencing his critical role in removing Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Bannon portrayed Gaetz as an anti-establishment figure poised to confront entrenched bureaucratic power, or what he calls the “Deep State.” Bannon suggested Gaetz’s nomination symbolizes Trump’s commitment to dismantling government corruption, with Gaetz as a "blow torch” to the Department of Justice. Additionally, Bannon celebrated the unconventional picks of Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence and other allies like Stephen Miller, signaling a radical reshaping of federal leadership under Trump. He spoke confidently about these individuals’ tenacity and described their intent to "deconstruct the administrative state,” targeting long-standing political figures such as Andrew Weissmann and Andrew McCabe. Bannon suggested that such individuals should prepare for rigorous legal scrutiny, hinting at intensified accountability efforts against perceived corruption. Throughout, Bannon framed the day as a pivotal, transformative moment for America, encouraging supporters to embrace the change they championed. He closed by expressing that this "hero’s journey” was only beginning and that the appointments would be instrumental in realizing Trump’s promise to restore America. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon talks about the factors that have made the re-election of Donald Trump into a mandate by the American people for him to set appointments and policies going forward.  Steve Bannon and Caroline Wren discussed the significance of Trump’s nomination of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. According to Bannon and Wren, Gaetz’s nomination marks a monumental shift in the U.S. political landscape, particularly as Trump seeks to regain control over what he views as a weaponized government. Gaetz, who previously faced DOJ investigations that were later dropped, represents someone uniquely suited to clean up the agency, Bannon argued, since he has experienced the agency’s alleged bias firsthand. Wren and Bannon emphasized that Gaetz’s Senate confirmation hearings could expose what they see as corruption within the DOJ. Bannon noted that the same DOJ that investigated Gaetz could face intense scrutiny during these hearings, potentially revealing evidence of political bias. Wren believes that the hearings might actually work to Gaetz’s advantage, allowing him to expose DOJ actions she describes as unjust. Both Wren and Bannon underscored Gaetz’s strategic skills, with Wren calling him a "master chess player” who’s often underestimated. They anticipate that, while the confirmation process will face opposition, particularly from some Republicans aligned with Mitch McConnell, Gaetz’s nomination could gain enough support. They concluded that Gaetz’s leadership in the DOJ could catalyze broader reforms, with Bannon viewing Gaetz as capable of dismantling what he calls the "deep state” and restoring justice.  Darren Beattie emphasized the critical importance of nominating Matt Gaetz as Attorney General in Trump’s second term, describing Gaetz as someone with a deep understanding of the "Deep State” and the determination needed to reform the Department of Justice (DOJ). Beattie highlighted Gaetz’s personal experience with an FBI investigation and his resilience through the ordeal, which he believes qualifies him to lead reform efforts at the DOJ. According to Beattie, Gaetz’s refusal to back down or compromise sets him apart as a true "warrior” against entrenched governmental corruption. Beattie argued that the DOJ, more than any other agency, represents the heart of American law and order, making its politicization especially dangerous. The current corruption within the DOJ, he contended, has led many Americans to view the country as a “banana republic,” where the justice system is used to target political enemies. For Trump’s administration to effectively combat these issues, Beattie believes Gaetz is essential as Attorney General to confront and dismantle the systemic rot within the DOJ and restore the rule of law. Beattie also encouraged readers to visit Revolver News to explore potential key appointments, including Scott Bessent for Treasury, emphasizing the importance of strategic leadership in advancing Trump’s agenda in a potential second term. Steve Bannon described the foundation of the America First movement as the Working Class Americans.  Steve Bannon delivered a fiery call to action, emphasizing that America stands at a "fork in the road” moment, demanding a drastic shift in governance and transparency. He argued that the administrative "Deep State” — intelligence, law enforcement, military, and media apparatuses — has morphed into a power the Founding Fathers never intended, stifling true democratic principles and forcing economic burdens on the average citizen. Bannon praised figures like Matt Gaetz as embodying courage and resilience against the government’s power. He likened their determination to the profiles in courage from history, insisting that, like him and Trump, they represent a spirit that cannot be broken. Bannon contended that the recent election showed a public mandate for a new form of governance, challenging mainstream portrayals of MAGA supporters as undemocratic. He underscored Trump’s plan to install "warrior” leaders, pledging a transparent, people-driven government. He cited historical resonance, invoking the upcoming 250th anniversary of Lexington and Concord, framing the movement as providential. Finally, Bannon warned that the establishment’s toughness would falter once stripped of power, vowing that the public, once exposed to the "truth,” would back Trump’s cause to restore America.

Steve Bannon, in a discussion with Mike Davis, criticized Senate Republicans for failing to counter Democrats’ push to confirm federal judges during the lame-duck session. He highlighted Elizabeth Warren’s leadership in advancing 28 pending judicial nominations and warned of the long-term impact these lifetime appointments could have on reshaping federal courts. Bannon and Davis emphasized the crucial role of appellate courts, where 99% of federal cases are decided, and noted that Biden’s judicial appointments could surpass Trump’s historic achievements. They argued that Senate Republicans must emulate Democrats’ obstruction tactics from Trump’s presidency by showing up to work, voting, and halting these confirmations. Bannon framed the judicial battle as essential to preserving the Trump Revolution and protecting constitutionalist principles, calling on Republicans to prioritize their responsibilities and take immediate action.  In this discussion with Steve Bannon, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) expressed concerns over the escalating Ukraine-Russia conflict, emphasizing that Congress has not formally declared war on Russia, yet U.S. involvement continues to intensify. She questioned what actions the House of Representatives could take to prevent further escalation, suggesting invoking the War Powers Act to ensure the President consults Congress. MTG also highlighted the lack of public support for war and criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict. MTG then shifted to another topic, criticizing the inclusion of a transgender member of Congress, Tim McBride, and the potential threat this poses to women’s privacy. She expressed concerns over men using women’s bathrooms and locker rooms, framing it as an assault on women’s rights. MTG demanded action from Speaker Johnson to protect women’s spaces, noting that the issue must be addressed in Congress’s rules. She concluded by rallying support for President Trump’s future administration, emphasizing the importance of unified resistance to the opposition, including Senators who voted for controversial appointments. MTG called for a focus on American sovereignty, the economy, and ending the military-industrial complex’s influence over Congress. She urged continued grassroots action to challenge the establishment and support America First policies. Part One:   Part Two:  Part Three:  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Garrett Ziegler discuss several key political issues. Ziegler starts by thanking Bannon for his support during Bannon’s time in prison and mentions his efforts to provide election night coverage. The pair criticize the left-wing media for undermining their reporting. Ziegler asserts that their focus on figures like Hunter Biden and the Biden family’s alleged corruption is crucial for the America First movement. They discuss the possibility of Joe Biden issuing pardons for his family, notably Hunter Biden, given his legal troubles. Ziegler suggests that Biden should issue blanket pardons, noting the legal jeopardy Hunter faces. Bannon agrees, emphasizing the dangerous conditions Hunter could face in federal prison, and calls for the justice system to hold all political figures accountable, particularly those involved in corruption. The conversation shifts to the need for stronger leadership in U.S. government agencies, with Ziegler advocating for the firing of corrupt officials in the DOJ and other institutions. They also critique the progressive overreach in agencies like the FCC and DOJ, calling for a return to a more accountable and constitutionally grounded system. Both express their concerns over the misuse of lawfare and the need for a stronger, more unified approach to restoring justice and accountability.

Alex Jones and Steve Bannon discussed the ongoing legal and financial turmoil surrounding Jones’ media platform, InfoWars. Jones described the situation as an unprecedented case of “lawfare,” alleging bankruptcy fraud and irregularities in an auction process meant to determine InfoWars’ ownership. According to Jones, the process was manipulated by Democrat-affiliated groups and Justice Department officials to undermine him and seize control of his brand. Jones recounted how the auction, supposedly authorized by a judge, shifted to a secretive and rigged bid favoring a politically connected group. This group allegedly pledged future earnings from defamation lawsuits against Jones, despite such bids being legally questionable. He highlighted that his team filed lawsuits against this process, claiming it violated bankruptcy laws. The judge overseeing the case expressed confusion and concern about the auction’s legitimacy. Jones detailed the immediate fallout, including a drastic drop in revenue and misinformation campaigns that confused supporters into believing his operations had ceased. He accused his adversaries of seeking to destroy the InfoWars brand by turning it into a parody site promoting progressive ideals, as revealed in internal documents and public statements. Despite these challenges, Jones vowed to continue broadcasting, asserting that his primary revenue streams remain intact. Bannon praised Jones’ resilience, likening his fight to the broader struggle against “weaponized” legal tactics targeting dissenting voices. Jones urged his audience to stay informed via his backup platforms while his legal battles unfold.  Mike Benz highlighted key dynamics surrounding the resistance to Donald Trump’s presidency and his potential second term, focusing on the battle for strategic appointments, particularly the FBI director. He underscored the entrenched opposition from establishment forces aiming to suppress Trump’s populist-nationalist agenda. Benz noted that this resistance manifests through coordinated efforts by the intelligence, media, and tech sectors to marginalize populist voices. Central to his critique was Mike Rogers, a former intelligence leader and contender for FBI director. Benz argued Rogers is emblematic of the establishment’s censorship apparatus, citing his affiliation with the Atlantic Council and its role in training journalists to identify "disinformation,” particularly targeting Trump. He linked Rogers to the CIA-backed International Republican Institute (IRI), which purportedly orchestrates global censorship initiatives, including Brazil’s anti-misinformation laws and the EU’s Digital Services Act. Benz contrasted Rogers with Cash Patel, a staunch Trump ally and advocate for government reform, emphasizing Patel’s alignment with the MAGA movement’s goals. He criticized the potential nomination of Rogers as compromising Trump’s agenda, asserting that the FBI director must share a cohesive vision with the Justice Department to avoid sabotage. The discussion also touched on broader institutional challenges, including the State Department’s alleged complicity in promoting censorship and undermining Trump’s policies. Benz concluded that Trump’s team must navigate complex political negotiations to secure appointees aligned with populist values while contending with establishment resistance.  Steve Bannon outlined a strategy for President Trump’s potential second term, emphasizing the importance of judicial appointments and Senate control. He highlighted the opportunity to appoint 20–25 judges early in the term, contrasting Biden’s current tally of over 300 judicial confirmations. Bannon criticized the Senate’s focus on an omnibus bill, arguing it distracts from critical battles such as blocking Biden’s judicial picks and combating Democratic strategies like pre-emptive hearings to target conservative figures. He stressed the need for “all hands on deck” in both the Senate and House to delay funding resolutions until after Trump’s inauguration, enabling a Republican-led budget overhaul. Bannon urged swift preparations for confirmations, recommending flooding the zone with nominees to overwhelm opposition and alleviate pressure on more controversial candidates. Bannon also endorsed figures like Russ Vought for leadership roles, citing their expertise in budget management. He called for rejecting inflated budgets, advocating for significant cuts to wasteful spending. Shifting focus, Bannon highlighted grassroots movements like Public Square as alternatives to mainstream commerce, aligning economic choices with conservative values. Lastly, he dismissed narratives undermining Trump’s mandate, asserting the former president’s legitimacy through popular and electoral victories while rallying conservatives to stay engaged in ongoing political fights.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon discussed the urgency of addressing critical economic, fiscal, and political challenges under a potential Trump administration. They emphasized the need for decisive action to combat rising debt, inefficient spending, and structural economic issues. Patrick highlighted specific priorities: reallocating unspent COVID and infrastructure funds to meaningful programs, closing the southern border to save on welfare costs, and expanding domestic energy production to bolster national wealth. He noted these efforts must complement growth-driven policies, as spending cuts alone cannot address the $2 trillion deficit. Bannon underscored the economic challenges exacerbated by government-driven employment and stagnant productivity, warning that the current system is unsustainable. He stressed that Trump’s team must implement supply-side reforms, tackle the deficit, and address the looming expiration of tax cuts for the middle and working classes. The duo also addressed geopolitical tensions and the economic fallout from the Ukraine war as critical areas requiring immediate attention. On practical steps, Patrick recommended using Birch Gold for hedging investments through precious metals as a safeguard against economic instability. Together, they urged viewers to remain vigilant and proactive in the fight for economic recovery and political accountability.  Natalie Winters addressed the residence and sabotage of President Trump, his picks to lead his administration, and his America First policies by the elite in the media and in government jobs in Washington DC, who were continuing on in their efforts as public servants to thwart Trump and his supporters.  Activist Cleta Mitchell gives an update on the Elections she is following from around the country that have still not been called.

Steve Bannon commented on the growing pressure from the left-wing Democrats and Wall Street figures like Mark Rowan regarding the Trump administration’s Treasury situation. Bannon emphasized the centrality of the Treasury role in implementing President Trump’s economic program, which he views as crucial to revitalizing the country. He stated that the Treasury is perhaps even more important than the Attorney General in advancing Trump’s economic policies, which many supporters rallied behind. However, Bannon raised concerns about Mark Rowan, the head of Apollo, a major Wall Street firm, saying that figures like him—representing "predatory capitalism”—may not align with Trump’s vision. He criticized the practice of outsourcing jobs to China for cheaper labor, which he sees as detrimental to American interests. Bannon suggested that if Trump were to bring people like Rowan into his administration, it would undermine the economic revival he aims to achieve. He jokingly compared it to bringing in figures like Larry Fink or Leon Black, who represent the same establishment interests. Bannon also pointed out that the transition team is still deliberating, as evidenced by Trump’s lack of firm decisions, and expressed frustration with the way Fox News was downplaying issues related to the transition. He noted that the edge that Representative Matt Gaetz brought to the conversation was missing, and the transition team needed to "reboot” and find fresh momentum with strong nominees. According to Bannon, Gaetz had been the "tip of the spear,” driving the narrative and pushing back against establishment forces.  Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon engaged in a fiery discussion about the FBI’s current state, its leadership challenges, and the role of figures like Kash Patel and Mike Rogers. Both agreed that the FBI has strayed from its original mission due to cultural and political rot at its senior levels, emphasizing the need for a thorough overhaul. Bannon criticized the public integrity unit for politicizing justice and called for purging leadership to restore the FBI’s credibility. He highlighted Trump’s vision of appointing leaders committed to reform but lamented Senate confirmation challenges. Posobiec and Bannon expressed skepticism about figures like Rogers, alleging his involvement in past controversies like Russiagate and close ties with establishment figures like James Clapper. They accused media outlets, including Fox News, of pushing narratives to undermine the populist-nationalist movement and surround Trump with moderate appointees. The conversation emphasized the divide between rank-and-file FBI agents and its leadership, with Bannon challenging the lack of whistleblowers amidst alleged abuses. He also criticized Fox News and the Murdochs for promoting establishment-friendly narratives, contrasting it with their commitment to dismantling and rebuilding the FBI to better serve Americans. The discussion underscored a broader battle between populist forces and entrenched establishment players, with Bannon framing the struggle as critical to preserving the MAGA agenda. Both concluded with a call for vigilance and action, underscoring their commitment to challenging perceived corruption and systemic failures within the U.S. government.  In a heated conversation, Steve Bannon and Jeff Clark discuss their skepticism about being convicted in Washington D.C. courts, criticizing the jury pool, which they view as biased towards progressive left-wing government employees. Bannon argues that the D.C. judiciary, particularly the district and circuit judges, is corrupt and should be reformed. He stresses the importance of legal defense and warns that those involved in high-profile cases, like Rudy Giuliani, have faced financial ruin due to expensive legal battles. Both Bannon and Clark advocate for a deep structural overhaul of government institutions, particularly the FBI, which they claim is politically biased against conservatives and populists. They argue that the FBI’s influence has grown unchecked, with power consolidating among career bureaucrats rather than elected officials, undermining the Constitutional separation of powers. Clark emphasizes the need for a unified executive branch with the president in full control, rather than a fractured system where unelected bureaucrats exert undue influence. He critiques the rise of the “administrative state,” which has evolved since the Progressive Era, and warns against proposals to put parts of the FBI under dual supervision, arguing this would only exacerbate the issue. They both express a desire to dismantle this “deep state” and restore accountability to government agencies, comparing their efforts to the fall of empires like Carthage. Bannon concludes by highlighting the fight against a system that they believe undermines democratic values and accountability.  In a this conversation between Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, the discussion centered on a significant legal victory for President Trump, which was a temporary win in New York. Bannon highlighted that while this ruling is a victory for Trump, it’s essential to recognize that the left-wing legal apparatus, led by figures like Norm Eisen, is already preparing to continue its efforts. Winters pointed out that even though Trump’s team has won this round, the lawfare strategy against him remains relentless, with a focus on accountability for what they see as political attacks. Bannon emphasized the danger of the lawfare apparatus, which he views as a significant threat to American democracy. He noted that the “Resistance” movement, including individuals like Jamie Raskin and Jerry Nadler, are jockeying for power in Congress, signaling that the left’s push to undermine Trump and his supporters is far from over. According to Bannon, these attacks are aimed at a long-term strategy to eliminate political opposition and protect a system that works against conservative ideals. The conversation also brought attention to Eisen’s group, the States United Democracy Center, which has been involved in pushing election integrity measures aligned with the left-wing agenda. Winters revealed that this group circulated a memo to the Arizona Attorney General’s office, pushing for actions that align with their broader efforts to disrupt conservative movements and ensure that power remains with the political establishment. Bannon’s tone was clear: while victories like these may seem significant, the lawfare effort will continue unabated until there is accountability for those responsible.

Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters had a fun and pleasant conversation about her points of view on numerous news headlines and topics, and Winters gave her reaction to trending news. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon and Frank Gaffney discuss U.S. foreign policy, focusing on Israel’s conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, alongside broader global tensions. They criticize the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, alleging it undermines Israel’s security by empowering hostile forces like Hezbollah and Iran. Gaffney claims Biden’s policies contradict the pro-Israel sentiment of American voters and impede Netanyahu’s efforts to neutralize threats. They accuse the administration of using extortion tactics, such as weapon supply delays and leveraging U.N. resolutions, to coerce Israel into unfavorable agreements. The discussion links these actions to a broader agenda of weakening U.S. allies and prioritizing adversarial regimes. Gaffney draws parallels to Obama-era strategies, suggesting an overarching continuity in policies allegedly hostile to Israel. He promotes initiatives like the "Working Group on Israel” to counter these trends. Turning to Ukraine, Bannon and Gaffney express concerns over escalating tensions, including potential tactical nuclear deployment. They frame this as part of a Chinese strategy to entangle U.S. resources globally, hindering its ability to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. They argue for restraint, suggesting Trump could negotiate peace and realign U.S. priorities. Their conversation underscores skepticism about current U.S. leadership and advocates for a robust response to global challenges.  Steve Bannon and Robbie Starbuck discussed Starbuck’s efforts to challenge wokeness in corporate America, describing it as a battle against a “new form of communism” that seeks to control the minds of corporate leaders rather than seizing production. Starbuck outlined his strategy of targeting companies reliant on conservative consumers, forcing them to abandon woke policies by demonstrating financial consequences. Notable successes include Harley-Davidson, John Deere, and Tractor Supply, which faced significant losses due to consumer boycotts. Starbuck highlighted Walmart as a turning point, negotiating a shift away from woke policies. He emphasized that consumer-driven backlash reshaped the corporate landscape, as companies began recognizing their dependence on regular Americans rather than ESG-driven entities like BlackRock or Vanguard. Bannon noted how woke ideologies infiltrated corporations through mechanisms like CEI scores and international advocacy groups pushing "a new type of capitalism.” Starbuck explained that such frameworks replaced traditional profit-driven leadership with ideologically aligned executives. Looking ahead, Starbuck urged the next Trump administration to prioritize dismantling woke frameworks through DOJ investigations and executive orders, particularly by addressing civil rights violations linked to DEI programs. He also suggested aligning federal contracts to discourage woke policies. Both agreed that this grassroots movement was reshaping corporate America, with Bannon calling it an economic battle to restore traditional values and economic fairness.  Jacqueline Toboroff talks about her thoughts and opinions about President Trump’s choice for Surgeon General.

Bannon highlights Trump’s use of tariffs as a powerful tool against key trading partners—Mexico, Canada, and China—demanding action on issues like fentanyl and border security. He recalls Mexico’s swift response to Trump’s tariff threats, deploying troops to address migration concerns. Tariffs, according to Bannon, expose the inefficiencies of globalist institutions and align with American workers’ interests by pressuring governments to reform. He criticizes Wall Street-backed media for defending a failing system that suppresses wages for low-skilled American workers by promoting mass immigration and global competition. This strategy, he argues, prioritizes corporate profits over citizens’ welfare, driving down wages while elites reap benefits. Bannon claims tariffs would reverse these trends, increasing wages and strengthening American sovereignty. Concluding, Bannon asserts that the populist movement holds the moral high ground, focusing on economic policies benefiting American workers. He calls for bold tariff measures, believing they could dismantle the Chinese Communist Party and realign global trade in favor of U.S. interests.  Steve Bannon outlined a three-pronged strategy for reshaping government and advancing populist-nationalist policies. First, he emphasized “deconstruction of the administrative state,” targeting the entrenched bureaucratic systems that overreach into citizens’ lives. Bannon praised Russ Vought for his detailed plans to reduce federal spending and dismantle inefficient programs systematically, not just through deregulation or firing bad actors. Second, he stressed economic nationalism, including tariffs and trade policies to strengthen domestic industries. Bannon commended figures like Kevin Hassett for shifting toward populist economics and underscored the importance of a unified strategy under Trump’s leadership. Finally, Bannon addressed national security concerns, warning against escalating tensions in Ukraine, including reports of potential deployment of tactical nuclear weapons. He called for a focused effort to manage these priorities through Project 2025, emphasizing preparation with expert teams to ensure swift and effective action if Trump takes office in 2025.  In a this conversation between Kari Lake and Steve Bannon, they discussed the urgency of addressing illegal immigration under President Biden’s administration, focusing on the “Biden invasion” that began on January 20, 2021, and its impact on the U.S. border. Bannon argued for a focused approach, proposing that deportation efforts should target individuals who arrived after Biden took office, estimating this number at around 10 million. He emphasized the importance of defining this effort clearly and humanely, acknowledging that many immigrants were lured by economic interests and the Biden administration’s lax policies. Lake agreed, asserting that this deportation should be prioritized and humane, while stressing the need to send individuals back to their home countries, particularly those trafficked or involved in criminal activities. She suggested using a combination of tariffs and foreign aid to pressure countries to take back their citizens, especially as the U.S. faces global security threats, including from China. Bannon and Lake also discussed the role of foreign aid and U.S. policy, with Bannon criticizing the current administration’s approach to foreign aid, which he believes exacerbates issues like climate change and poverty. They called for a shift in foreign aid to focus on combating communism and fostering economic stability in other countries, rather than promoting progressive ideologies. Both agreed that President Trump’s economic strategies, including tariffs and negotiations, could help address the illegal immigration crisis and restore order to the U.S. border. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters sheds light on the ongoing efforts by the”Deep State” to undermine President Donald Trump. Winters argues that there is a concerted effort to pre-label Trump as an autocrat to delegitimize his political influence and agenda. This tactic, she asserts, is part of a larger strategy by establishment elites and bureaucratic insiders to control the narrative and prevent the populist-nationalist movement, which Trump has championed, from gaining further momentum. According to Winters, this effort is not just about targeting Trump personally, but about framing any challenge to the status quo as inherently dangerous to democracy. By labeling Trump as an autocrat, critics aim to stoke fear and paint his policies as authoritarian, even when they are rooted in American values like national sovereignty and individual freedom. This framing is seen as a way to delegitimize the concerns of millions of Americans who support Trump’s platform. Winters points to the media’s role in amplifying this narrative, as well as the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, which she argues are politically motivated attempts to weaken his influence. She believes that by preemptively labeling Trump as a threat to democratic norms, the Deep State is trying to sideline the populist movement and prevent meaningful change in Washington. Winters argues that this effort to label Trump an autocrat is not just a personal attack on the former president, but part of a broader battle over control of American politics and governance.  Steve Bannon outlines a powerful critique of the American political system, framing it as deeply flawed and working against the interests of the American people, especially the working and middle classes. He argues that the “system defenders” cling to outdated institutions that need reform, purging, and renewal, echoing the concept of “creative destruction” that has historically driven societal progress. Bannon emphasizes the necessity of addressing the “unitary theory of the executive,” asserting that the president’s executive authority, especially in national security and law enforcement, should not be undermined by the deep state or administrative bureaucracy. He passionately defends his legal battles over executive privilege, stating that he would willingly serve time again to uphold these principles. Bannon criticizes the judiciary and Department of Justice (DOJ) for corruption, calling for a total overhaul, including firing U.S. attorneys and reshaping the DOJ with a more aggressive approach. He warns that unless populist forces seize key institutions, meaningful reform is impossible. He challenges figures like Mitch McConnell, who he believes protect the institutional status quo, and underscores the urgent need for reforming the administrative state to ensure it serves the American people rather than the elites. Ultimately, Bannon calls for a strategic fight to seize control of the institutions to effect real change.

In a conversation about election dynamics, Steve Bannon, Natalie Winters, and Jack Posobiec analyze anticipated voter behavior and the mainstream media’s framing of a potential “red mirage.” Winters criticizes the media’s narrative as an attempt to preemptively undermine Republican wins by blaming delayed ballot counts. She highlights that changes in election laws will likely reduce delays in key states, potentially preventing scenarios like those seen in 2020. Posobiec emphasizes high turnout among working-class, rural voters in Pennsylvania, particularly men, describing this as a “populist uprising.” He notes sparse turnout in urban Democratic strongholds, contrasting with strong GOP participation in rural areas. The group also discusses Project 65, a legal group targeting Trump-aligned lawyers, and points out that government agencies are closely monitoring polling in swing states. They argue that these actions reveal the Democrats’ “lawfare” tactics, suggesting attempts to undermine GOP voting efforts. Bannon and Posobiec wrap up by expressing disdain for Democratic leaders and highlighting their platform as a counter to media narratives, emphasizing a populist, anti-establishment movement in the run-up to the 2024 election.  In a discussion with Steve Bannon, Cliff Maloney emphasized a robust Republican effort in Pennsylvania, detailing a field campaign with 120 workers aiming to reach 500,000 doors by election night. Maloney expressed confidence in the Republican ground game and mail-in vote strategy, reporting that Republicans are closing the gap in areas traditionally dominated by Democratic mail-in ballots. He argued that Democrats are failing to mobilize the same level of turnout as 2020, potentially weakening their strongholds. Bannon and other speakers noted shifting voter sentiments, particularly among African American men in Philadelphia, indicating a growing dissatisfaction with Democratic policies. While Democratic strategists like Jonathan Martin highlighted an impressive ground game in Pennsylvania, Bannon countered that Republicans’ targeted efforts are paying off. Both Bannon and Maloney underscored the importance of turnout, especially from first-time and low-propensity voters, to secure a victory in Pennsylvania.  In this discussion, Ben Bergquam and Jordan Conradson report on two key issues from Maricopa County on election day. First, Bergquam reveals a leaked ICE memo directing agents in Arizona and Pennsylvania not to wear uniforms or badges when voting, citing concerns that it might deter or “spook” non-citizens present at polling sites. Bannon criticizes this directive as disrespectful to ICE agents, viewing it as an unnecessary accommodation for illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Conradson describes extensive wait times at Arizona polling locations, noting that Maricopa County’s lengthy four-page ballot takes voters around 30 minutes to complete, contrary to the county’s estimated 10–12 minutes. This is causing long lines, raising concerns of delays similar to those seen in 2022. Despite these challenges, Republicans report an early lead over Democrats in Arizona, though turnout remains crucial.  Steve Bannon and Lara Trump expressed confidence in the Republican voter turnout for Election Day, highlighting significant early voting and long lines in key battleground states. She noted efforts to address voting issues, including poll watcher access and machine problems. Lara emphasized the GOP’s targeted strategy of mobilizing low-propensity voters, which particularly benefits Trump. She also reported a decrease in urban turnout alongside increased rural participation, which she believes favors Republicans. Bannon discussed minority voting patterns, with Lara citing high polling support for Trump among African-American, Hispanic, and Arab-American voters. Lara remained optimistic about North Carolina staying red, citing effective local voter outreach. She encouraged Republicans to stay informed via social media updates on any voting issues, aiming to boost confidence and encourage turnout.  Sam Faddis, discussing Pennsylvania’s voter turnout with Steve Bannon, emphasized an unprecedented level of in-person voting participation, suggesting that early mail-in voting had not detracted from Election Day turnout. Reporting from his precinct and various regions statewide, Faddis described exceptionally high voter engagement, with lines and wait times, such as two-hour waits in places like Hamburg near Allentown. Areas like Bradford and Northumberland Counties, as well as Erie, reported record turnout. Faddis highlighted that these numbers surpassed anything previously seen in Pennsylvania, indicating strong overall participation. He directed listeners to follow updates via AND Magazine’s Substack and his social media.  In this discussion, Steve Bannon and Kash Patel analyzed current polling data and turnout in key states. They noted that Trump, in 2020, was down by an average of 8.4 points at this stage, while in this cycle, he trails by only one point. Patel emphasized Nevada’s turnout, highlighting high voter participation in Las Vegas’ Clark County, where Republicans now lead by 45,000 votes compared to trailing by 145,000 in 2020. He urged voters in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin to get to the polls, believing that Trump has the numbers to win if supporters turn out. The conversation also touched on reports from Philadelphia and Arizona, where Bannon described “machine state” tactics, mentioning Democratic operatives and long voting lines in urban areas. Patel and Bannon expressed concern about an email directing ICE agents in Arizona and Pennsylvania not to wear uniforms or badges while voting, speculating this might be intended to avoid intimidating non-citizens at the polls. They found this directive troubling, seeing it as a slight against ICE agents.  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse discuss strategies and emerging data regarding Republican voter turnout and potential victories in key regions during an election. DeGrasse emphasizes Republican gains in Guam and early indicators of strong GOP performance in places like Florida and New York, where Republicans reportedly lead Democrats by significant margins in voter turnout. He also highlights New Hampshire’s unexpectedly high turnout and close races, signaling competitive dynamics. The two also discuss the importance of New York congressional seats, which could block Democrat Hakeem Jeffries from gaining a majority in the House. Bannon and DeGrasse urge Republican voters to remain calm and patient, particularly in high-turnout areas, to counteract any potential delays or challenges. DeGrasse mentions the deployment of election integrity teams and lawyers to oversee potential issues and encourages voters to document irregularities. The goal, they emphasize, is a smooth and legally solid process to ensure Republican victories and certify results swiftly. Both assert that these proactive efforts are crucial for the GOP’s path to control in the House.

Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris gave her concession speech on Wednesday afternoon. Natalie Winters and Steve Bannon each reacted to the confusing speech.  Natalie Winters discussed the opponents of President Trump, who was declared the winner of the 2024 Presidential elections in the early morning hours of Wednesday. Winters told Steve Bannon that she has seen evidence in public statements that people are devising plans and organizing to fight Trump and his agenda in various ways.  In their discussion, Ret. Lt. Col. Mike Flynn and Steve Bannon outline concerns about anticipated obstacles facing Donald Trump if he returns to office. They describe political opposition as a “battlefield” where Trump’s adversaries will attempt to thwart his agenda from the start. Flynn emphasizes that preparations must begin now, including forming a dedicated team capable of enacting swift reforms and dismantling entrenched structures within government agencies. He suggests immediate personnel changes upon Trump’s hypothetical inauguration, targeting high-level bureaucrats who may obstruct Trump’s policies. Flynn also underscores the importance of Trump’s physical security, advising him to establish a secure base of operations at Mar-a-Lago and rely on specialized military personnel over the Secret Service, whose integrity he questions. Bannon and Flynn propose a bold restructuring of federal agencies and advocate for strong accountability measures. They argue that Trump must enact sweeping policies, including a robust deportation plan, a return to energy independence, and a regulatory rollback to bolster the economy. Both insist that this approach would restore America’s global stature and meet the demands of Trump’s base for accountability, suggesting a potential task force or commission to investigate political adversaries and swiftly address internal corruption. Flynn and Bannon envision Trump’s leadership as essential to reversing what they view as America’s current instability and restoring control domestically and internationally.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon recently discussed concerns over the U.S. economy, with Patrick highlighting the national debt as America’s top security issue, stating, "Debt service payments last fiscal year were 50% above U.S. defense spending.” He explained that high debt levels limit domestic spending and increase dependency on foreign creditors, which he agreed makes the U.S. vulnerable. Patrick also saw recent developments as a rejection of Bidenomics and a vindication of sound fiscal policies, though he acknowledged that Trump would inherit a more challenging economic landscape than in 2016. Turning to financial markets, Patrick and Bannon addressed the recent highs in gold prices. Patrick noted that "central banks have been moving into gold at record levels,” seeing this as a response to U.S. deficit spending and international concerns about dollar stability. He encouraged listeners to consider diversifying into precious metals, suggesting that viewers visit Birch Gold to learn more. Addressing accusations that Bannon aims to destabilize the dollar, he clarified that his “End of the Dollar Empire” series is intended as a "cry for help,” urging policy reforms. Patrick expressed frustration over media misrepresentations and emphasized the series’ intent to highlight economic issues, not advocate the destruction of the dollar.  Natalie Winters talked about the difference between supporters of President Trump and his opponents and said she believed a big difference in the agenda of the two groups was whether or not to put America first in the actions of the Federal government.  In this discussion between Richard Barris and Steve Bannon, the two analyzed the evolving situation in Arizona’s election results, focusing on Carrie Lake’s chances of overcoming her deficit and the broader implications for President Trump’s position. Barris noted that while Lake was trailing by 59,000 votes, there were still a million outstanding votes, primarily from Maricopa County, which tends to report slowly. He emphasized that while Lake could still win without Maricopa, her path to victory depended on gaining significant margins in upcoming ballot dumps. Barris explained that Trump’s lead of nearly 5 points in Arizona would likely help drag Lake across the finish line if the results continued to favor her in key counties. The conversation then shifted to a broader discussion about the strength of Trump’s coalition, which Barris argued was stronger than in previous elections. Trump had managed to expand his support among college-educated whites, working-class voters, and diverse communities, including Black and Hispanic voters. Barris praised the inclusivity of Trump’s coalition, suggesting it resembled a mandate, and pointed to states like New Jersey and New York as areas where the GOP could find future opportunities. He warned against backsliding into establishment politics and urged a continued focus on populist-nationalist policies. Barris concluded by inviting listeners to follow his analysis on Locals.

Natalie Winters discusses a report that shows illegal immigrants are going to surge at the US’s open borders.  Oscar El Blue Ramirez, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, discussed the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border in the context of shifting immigration policies and the 2024 election. He described a recent surge in migrants, with a caravan of over 3,000 people arriving on Election Day. Many migrants believed Kamala Harris would win, making it easier to enter the U.S., but the prospect of Trump’s stricter policies has led some to reconsider or return home. Ramirez noted that the Biden administration’s CBP One app, which allows migrants to apply for asylum from within Mexico, has seen increased use. He mentioned that many migrants now come from diverse regions, including Central and South America, the Middle East, and South Asia. According to Ramirez, organized crime, including cartels, profits from the migration surge by charging migrants for assistance in crossing into the U.S. through Guatemala and Mexico. He also accused international organizations of encouraging migrants to enter before Trump possibly returns to office. He criticized Biden’s administration for financially supporting Mexican NGOs and facilities that, he claims, facilitate migration. Ramirez argued that the U.S. should stop federal grants to these NGOs, which he believes operate as proxies, complicating border security efforts. He warned that mass deportations under a potential Trump administration could lead to protests and chaos at the border, with organized crime and activist groups involved in exploiting the crisis.  Steve Bannon highlighted that "personnel is policy,” underscoring the critical role of staffing for a future Trump administration. He believes that top White House staff should be announced immediately to set a decisive tone. Bannon argues that prompt, careful selection will be crucial, particularly in light of what he perceives as previous failures in staffing and policy implementation. Bannon criticized figures like Jeff Miller, a lobbyist closely tied to Kevin McCarthy, whom he blames for the “disastrous debt ceiling deal” and the out-of-control spending that followed. Miller, in Bannon’s view, represents corporate interests—especially in areas like immigration reform, favoring cheap labor policies that align with Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Bannon suggests Miller is deeply connected with major corporate clients and is lobbying within Trump’s orbit, which he sees as a potential problem. To counter this influence, Bannon advocates for staffing that reflects “populist principles.” He supports figures like Susie Wiles, who, despite her reserved style, has proven effective and steady in past campaigns. Ultimately, Bannon asserts that a solid, aligned team will be essential for Trump’s policies to succeed and appeal to the expanding coalition of American citizens seeking real change.   Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse discussed the status of Republican control in the House and the Senate, highlighting both the importance of current seats and the role of outstanding races in securing a GOP majority. DeGrasse noted that the Associated Press has called 209 seats for Republicans, with 219 needed for a majority, and confidently projected that Republicans would secure at least 219 with expected wins in several key races. "The Associated Press will call them soon,” he said, referring to GOP-leaning districts in Arizona, California, Nebraska, and Washington that he believes will solidify the count. DeGrasse also emphasized ongoing efforts in key battleground states, pointing to close races in California and Colorado that could raise the GOP seat count to 221. He highlighted the tight race in Colorado’s Aurora district, an area significant to the MAGA movement, where Republicans hold a slight lead. Bannon and DeGrasse were optimistic but cautious about potential surprises in tight races, especially in states like California. Bannon framed the situation as part of a larger battle, with the GOP needing to hold the House to prevent Democrats from using it as a tool "to bring down MAGA and President Trump.” DeGrasse expressed confidence, saying that the GOP could reach up to 222 seats in a best-case scenario, depending on final vote counts and outcomes in toss-up districts.  Natalie Winters explains the weaponization of the Institutions by the Democrats who abused their power against President Trump’s movement , his family and himself.

Mike Davis emphasized the need for aggressive oversight by Congress, especially concerning the Biden administration’s use of “lawfare” to target former President Trump. Davis supported House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan’s move to demand documents from Special Counsel Jack Smith, indicating that a special prosecutor might be necessary to investigate the perceived bias and interference in Trump-related prosecutions. He pointed to actions by officials connected to the Biden administration, alleging coordinated legal moves in various states to hinder Trump’s candidacy. Davis criticized the prolonged ballot counting in Democrat-controlled states, contrasting it with quicker processes in states like Florida. He argued that inconsistencies in election administration raise doubts about democracy’s integrity. He underscored the need for voter reform, including proof of citizenship and voter ID, to restore public confidence. Davis concluded by calling for a robust Congressional response to prevent law enforcement and intelligence agencies from allegedly acting against elected leaders. He urged Senators, particularly Chuck Grassley, to continue probing the origins of investigations into Trump, framing these actions as essential to protecting American democracy from undue influence.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly discuss Representative Jim Jordan’s recent letter to Special Counsel Jack Smith, instructing him to preserve documents related to alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Kelly, a long-time advocate for accountability in this area, highlights the significance of this move, especially considering ongoing legal controversies surrounding Trump’s case in Florida. She claims there is documented evidence of collusion between the Biden administration, DOJ officials, and the National Archives to target Trump. Kelly mentions instances of mishandled evidence, witness tampering, and threats, specifically calling out prosecutors Jay Bratt and David Harbach for alleged misconduct. She believes House Republicans should investigate these actions thoroughly and consider pursuing criminal charges. Additionally, Kelly points readers to her detailed reports on Smith’s alleged misconduct, emphasizing the need for serious oversight. She suggests that House and Senate Republicans must scrutinize these allegations to ensure accountability within the DOJ.  In this conversation about the Arizona Senate race, Caroline Wren and Steve Bannon discussed Kari Lake’s unexpectedly close contest with Katie Hobbs. Wren highlighted the efforts of Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, who have provided detailed, district-by-district updates, revealing that Lake could potentially secure a win as the vote count narrows. She pointed out that many outstanding ballots are in Maricopa County, an area favorable to Lake, making the race even tighter. Wren explained the focus on “ballot curing”—correcting issues with ballots to ensure they’re counted—and mentioned that several conservative groups are actively assisting with this process, resulting in high curing rates for Republican voters. Despite their efforts, she expressed frustration with Arizona’s slow vote-counting process, attributing delays to a lack of transparency and Governor Katie Hobbs’ veto of proposed reforms to improve ballot processing efficiency. With Senate leadership elections approaching, Wren speculated that delays may be aimed at preventing Lake’s timely participation. She called for financial support to prepare for a potential recount, stressing that even small contributions could make a difference in securing Lake’s victory.  Steve Bannon and Mike Davis discussed the potential retirement of Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Davis addressed rumors and Democratic calls for Sotomayor to step down, possibly allowing the Biden administration to appoint a replacement. Davis argued that Senate Republicans should halt any attempts to confirm new judicial nominees before they regain Senate control in January. He suggested Senator Mike Lee as a key figure to block any rapid confirmations by utilizing Senate procedures that allow a single senator to slow the process significantly. Davis supported the idea of Sotomayor remaining in her position, dismissing Democratic efforts to replace her with another liberal judge as partisan. He emphasized the importance of preserving the vacancy for a future Trump nominee, citing the Republican majority in the new Congress. The Article III Project, led by Davis, plans to help Trump secure judicial nominations if he reclaims the presidency, aiming to prevent any last-minute Biden appointees to lifetime judicial positions.  In this discussion between Steve Bannon and Bill McGinley, the two highlighted concerns about alleged Democratic efforts to undermine Republican victories and President Trump’s agenda. McGinley commented on the Pennsylvania race, where David McCormick appeared to have a substantial lead, suggesting Democrats are attempting to challenge election outcomes they dislike, portraying their actions as hypocritical “election denialism.” He argued that Democrats aim to prevent Republicans from securing future majorities by stirring controversy and leveraging dark money for legal battles. McGinley emphasized the strength of the coalition Trump built with working- and middle-class voters, saying it was instrumental in recent successes and could fortify Republican control in future Senate races. McGinley predicted a proactive approach from a potential Trump administration, aimed at reversing Biden-era policies through mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act. He voiced support for civil service reform to align federal workers with elected leadership. Citing conservative judiciary appointments as an advantage, he forecasted a strategic response to Democratic “resistance,” warning of midnight regulations and judicial nominations pushed by the Biden administration to impede a Republican agenda. The conversation underscored a belief in Trump’s mandate to reduce government overreach and pursue a populist agenda in the second term.

In his commentary with Natalie Winters, Steve Bannon critiques mainstream media, particularly MSNBC, for allegedly ignoring the influence of a broad coalition of supporters and advisors behind the success of populist movements. He mentions prominent figures such as Bill Ackman and David Sacks, while emphasizing the importance of precision and clear messaging in countering what he sees as misinformation from the left. Bannon advocates for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate alleged wrongdoing and outlines ambitious goals for immigration reform, including mass deportations, to reshape U.S. demographics and political power. Bannon views growing Hispanic support as a key to building a durable political majority, likening it to the realignment seen in the 1930s. He discusses a “reckoning” for federal bureaucracies, a focus on states’ rights, and anticipates intense political battles against Democratic governors and state officials who oppose Trump’s policies. He forecasts a 2028 Democratic primary marked by high-profile governors, signaling a significant cultural resistance. Bannon predicts gender issues will increasingly overshadow racial issues, driven by a cultural shift against traditional power structures, which he believes will define future populist and nationalist debates. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec discussed a cultural struggle they see as a deeper fight than politics. They describe it as a battle between a "radical, Bolshevik, atheistic” worldview versus a Christian-Western foundation, with implications for societies beyond the U.S., including East Asian countries. Bannon argues that traditional values are under attack, citing trends in South Korea, China, and Japan where family and cultural traditions are weakening. Posobiec points out that these shifts mirror the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao promoted the "Four No’s” (no old ideas, culture, customs, or habits), viewing current cultural shifts on social media, especially TikTok, as similar. They highlight a new "4V” trend in South Korea as a reaction to this, where women reject modern norms in favor of traditional roles. Posobiec sees a cultural shift in the U.S. as well, with young women increasingly supporting populist ideas and Trump, reflected in polls showing an 11-point shift among women under 30 toward Trump since August. They connect this trend to a "bro culture” influence, where women align with traditional values and assertive male figures. Bannon sees this as part of a larger societal pushback against modern liberalism and a return to traditionalism, reinforced by media and cultural symbols. Posobiec also discusses several political issues, including the ongoing election battles in Pennsylvania and Arizona. He criticizes Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania senator, for his silence amid allegations of voter fraud, such as unverified ballots and signature discrepancies, calling out the incompetence and corruption surrounding these processes. Posobiec also mocks Casey’s efforts to appear active by tweeting about ballot counting, suggesting he should look for work at McDonald’s in Pennsylvania due to his lack of significant achievements. Turning to Arizona, Posobiec highlights the controversial and slow vote counting in Maricopa County, where large discrepancies in vote totals have raised concerns about transparency and integrity. He emphasizes the need for proper ballot chain-of-custody and ensures that volunteers working tirelessly for the election are recognized, particularly through organizations like Turning Point Action. Posobiec stresses the importance of securing a victory for Carrie Lake in the Senate and achieving a majority in the U.S. Senate, which he believes will strengthen President Trump’s political agenda. He encourages supporters to get involved, whether physically or virtually, to help safeguard election integrity and ensure Republican success.  Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon discuss the need for a special counsel to address ongoing corruption and legal issues, particularly around the mishandling of the Trump case. Giuliani, who has extensive knowledge of the situation, expresses willingness to assist in any investigation, emphasizing that the case is a miscarriage of justice and could set a dangerous precedent if not properly addressed. He criticizes former prosecutor Trey Gowdy, calling him ineffective and accusing him of failing to act during key moments in the investigation. Giuliani also raises questions about Gowdy’s mysterious departure from Congress, suggesting a possible connection to his lack of action. Giuliani also shares his personal legal struggles, detailing his ongoing battle with the 145 million dollar judgment and his claims of being unfairly treated by the justice system. He explains that key evidence, such as video recordings, has been altered or removed to deceive the court, and that his financial accounts and assets have been frozen, leaving him in dire circumstances. He argues that the case against him is a setup, orchestrated by powerful figures involved in corruption, including ties to Ukraine, and claims that ordinary people wouldn’t face such harsh treatment. Giuliani underscores the injustice of his situation, as well as the broader corruption at play.

Mike Davis and Steve Bannon criticized the FBI’s handling of January 6th, focusing on revelations from the Inspector General (IG) report. Davis highlighted concerns over the use of 26 confidential human informants at the Capitol, questioning why some informants were not prosecuted like other January 6th defendants. He called for a fresh investigation into the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) to address alleged weaponization of intelligence agencies. Davis suggested replacing the longstanding DOJ Inspector General with someone new to ensure accountability. He advocated for a special grand jury to investigate “Crossfire Hurricane,” alleging it was part of a broader effort by Democrats to weaponize law enforcement against political opponents. Davis tied this to previous events, including the Mar-a-Lago raid and alleged cover-ups of Hillary Clinton’s foreign dealings. Bannon emphasized the political timing of the IG report’s release, accusing the FBI of strategically dropping it to undermine upcoming reforms by Kash Patel, whom Bannon claimed would bring significant accountability to the FBI. Both speakers encouraged the War Room audience to continue pressuring senators to confirm Patel and support broader judicial reforms. The conversation framed these issues as critical to exposing and dismantling corruption within federal agencies. Davis underscored the importance of public action, citing the War Room Posse’s success in mobilizing thousands of contacts to influence senators. Both maintained optimism about achieving reforms through persistence and public engagement.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly criticized Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s recently released 88-page report on January 6th, dismissing it as inadequate and misleading. Kelly mocked the report’s heavy reliance on filler content, including Attorney General guidelines and already-available transcripts from the January 6th Committee, despite claims of access to 500,000 pages of documentation. Kelly questioned the report’s assertion of 26 FBI confidential human sources (CHS), citing defense attorneys’ skepticism. She argued that without a centralized FBI database or thorough field office inquiries, the figure is unreliable. Kelly also highlighted Horowitz’s dismissal of undercover FBI agents’ involvement, based solely on statements from FBI officials and DOJ policies. She called this approach disingenuous, given ongoing concerns about the FBI’s transparency and tactics. Both Bannon and Kelly agreed the report served as a tool for mainstream media to discredit legitimate questions about FBI informants’ roles in January 6th. They emphasized the need for new DOJ leadership, with Kelly asserting only Donald Trump could fire Horowitz and appoint an inspector general willing to conduct thorough investigations. Bannon and Kelly concluded that the report fails to address key issues, leaving serious questions about FBI involvement and government accountability unanswered.  Darren Beattie and Steve Bannon dissected the revelations from the recent Inspector General (IG) report on January 6th, sharply criticizing the media and FBI for misleading narratives. Beattie began by lambasting mainstream media for their “bait-and-switch” tactics, accusing them of using technicalities to downplay the FBI’s involvement. “The big lie is…none of the [26 confidential human sources] worked for the FBI full-time,” Beattie said, calling this a convenient narrative designed to mislead the public. Beattie highlighted inconsistencies in the FBI’s account, pointing to how confidential informants (CHS) were embedded with militia groups and reported in real-time to their FBI handlers. Despite their involvement, none were prosecuted. “Is it simply statistical chance that not a single CHS was charged with anything, even those who entered the Capitol?” he asked, asserting that this de facto immunity suggested tacit authorization. Steve Bannon built on Beattie’s points, emphasizing the leadership’s complicity. He noted that one FBI informant was the vice president of the Oath Keepers, further evidence of compromised leadership in key militia groups. Both agreed that FBI Director Christopher Wray had lied to Congress and withheld critical information, a failure Bannon described as "disgraceful.” Beattie concluded that these revelations vindicate critics of the January 6th narrative while exposing institutional failures. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Philip Patrick discussed the alarming state of U.S. national debt and economic policy. Patrick highlighted the staggering $624 billion budget deficit in just the first two months of the fiscal year, marking the worst start to a year in U.S. Treasury history. This marks a continuation of a worrying trend, with the U.S. deficit reaching new heights and projections indicating that another trillion dollars will be added in just 100 days. They framed this explosion of debt within the context of the Trump administration’s fiscal policies and the broader global tensions, including proxy wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Bannon stressed the immense impact of this fiscal recklessness, likening it to a “runaway train” and underscored the burden of debt on average Americans, who are facing rising inflation and an economic downturn. He pointed to the mounting debt, now comparable to a “second mortgage” for individuals, as driving inflation and worsening the financial outlook for U.S. families. They also discussed the volatility in financial markets, with Patrick noting that the stock market is now at historic highs, fueled by printed money and unsustainable fiscal policies, which he argued will ultimately lead to a market crash. Both urged listeners to consider precious metals like gold as a hedge against the inevitable economic turbulence.  Natalie WInters talked about her reaction to current events and her recent appearance with Piecre Morgan. Part One:  Part Two:   Steve Bannon criticized the lack of accountability within the U.S. political system, specifically pointing to the Hunter Biden laptop story, where he claimed that no one faced consequences for their actions. He expressed disdain for the absence of a strong value system and the government’s failure to self-investigate. Bannon warned that without intervention, the system would continue its downward spiral, and called for the removal of those in power. He also criticized modern monetary policies, particularly how they contribute to financial instability, arguing that the elite class avoids responsibility for the consequences of economic collapses, such as the 2008 crisis. Bannon believes this has sparked populist movements, which reflect widespread anger and disillusionment with the establishment. He drew comparisons to historical uprisings, warning that the same kind of anger could lead to violent outcomes if ignored. Bannon further emphasized the disconnect between the elites and the common people, pointing out that despite the promises of hope and change from Obama, the financial and social systems remain broken. He argued that the political elite, particularly those in neoliberal and neoconservative circles, have consistently failed to address the real issues facing ordinary Americans. Bannon also touched on the upcoming 2024 election, stating that the "anti-system” players were on the rise, predicting that the fight would not focus on issues like abortion but rather on the survival of the system itself.

Steve Bannon and Dave Bratt engaged in a wide-ranging conversation touching on politics, Ukraine, and the global implications of U.S. foreign policy. Bannon, reflecting on his role in the populist-nationalist movement, discussed his recent interactions at the New York Young Republicans Club dinner, which had become a significant gathering for nationalist thought. He highlighted the contrast between President Trump’s powerful speech and the crowd’s response, emphasizing the vibrant populist energy surrounding these events. Bratt, who had recently visited Ukraine with Christian leaders and think tank members, provided insights into the ongoing war, focusing on the political maneuvering of NATO countries. He explained that while he sympathizes with the Ukrainian people, he sees the West’s involvement as a manipulation, with nations like the U.S. and NATO seeking to maintain influence in the region. Bratt critiqued the narrative pushed by the U.S. government and its intelligence agencies, framing it as an example of failed diplomacy and foreign intervention. He pointed out the U.S. role in the 2014 Ukrainian coup and the lack of accountability for such actions, which he believes have led to the current crisis. Both men expressed skepticism about the motivations behind the war in Ukraine, with Bannon questioning the justifications for continued support. Bratt emphasized the need for a more honest conversation about the war’s roots and its broader geopolitical implications. They also touched on the role of Christian leaders, asserting that faith communities should seek peace and reconciliation rather than contribute to further division. Ultimately, both Bannon and Bratt called for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy, urging a shift toward prioritizing national interests and moral clarity. Part One:  Part Two:  Ben Bergquam, Oscar Ramirez, and Steve Bannon discuss the serious implications of illegal immigration and border security as President Trump prepares for his transition to office. Bergquam highlights the dangers posed by illegal alien “runners,” individuals trying to avoid detection while crossing the southern border, often with criminal backgrounds. These figures are facilitated by cartels exploiting asylum loopholes, leading to an influx of dangerous individuals. Oscar Ramirez echoes this concern, emphasizing the cartel’s growing power under the Biden administration, calling for immediate action to label cartels as terrorists and to leverage tariffs against Mexico to curb their operations. Bannon expands on the broader context, critiquing the Biden administration for exacerbating the border crisis and the political resistance to closing the border. He highlights the challenge President Trump faces, especially with the entrenched opposition from Republican senators like Mitch McConnell, who have been dismissive of the America First movement. Bannon stresses the need for immediate action on securing the border, including mass deportations, and insists that border security must be prioritized over other legislative concerns. He calls out McConnell for undermining Trump’s agenda and promoting an open-border policy, positioning it as a direct betrayal of American interests. The trio emphasizes that only President Trump has the will to address the crisis effectively and humanely, despite significant political resistance.

Steve Bannon talks about the announcement that Joe Biden will pardon his son, Hunter, and his belief that Hunter would not last in any federal prison.  Natalie Winters talked about the pardon for Hunter Biden.  Natalie Winters talked about the corruption with the family of Democrat Joe Biden.  Dr. Malone criticizes the ongoing bird flu scare, calling it another round of fear-mongering with little evidence to support concerns. He points out that previous cases of bird flu, such as those in Canada and California, have not led to significant health issues or human-to-human transmission. He dismisses this as psychological bioterrorism, meant to stir panic. Dr. Malone shifts focus to a recent House report on COVID-19, which he claims provides conclusive evidence that the pandemic originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and that the World Health Organization (WHO) withheld crucial information to protect the Chinese Communist Party. He also highlights the report’s criticism of lockdowns, quarantines, and vaccines, labeling them as failures. Malone calls for WHO Director-General Tedros to resign, asserting that Trump’s team should approach global health institutions cautiously, possibly withdrawing from the WHO and reconsidering involvement in organizations like the World Economic Forum. He further criticizes the NIH, especially under former leaders like Fauci, for its role in the pandemic response and its overall dysfunction. He recommends significant budget cuts and a complete overhaul to ensure the NIH serves the American people effectively. Malone believes that Trump should focus on dismantling problematic agencies and prioritizing national interests over globalist agendas.  Mike Benz talked about his investigations into corruption in Ukraine.  Julie Kelly joined Steve Bannon in the War Room to discuss what she sees as the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) weaponization against the defendants on January 6th, contrasting it with the leniency shown toward Hunter Biden. Bannon opened the discussion by framing January 20, 2025, as "Accountability Day,” emphasizing the need for justice for those he described as political prisoners. Kelly detailed how recent DOJ actions have ramped up against January 6th participants, even four years after the event, alleging that federal authorities are targeting individuals to weaken the “patriot movement.” She described these efforts as punitive and vengeful, with defendants facing harsh penalties, excessive pretrial detentions, and what she called "torture-like conditions.” The conversation shifted to Hunter Biden’s recent plea agreement and the leniency he has been afforded despite allegations of serious crimes committed while his father was in office. Kelly argued that Biden’s pardon groundwork opens the door for similar clemency for defendants on January 6th, highlighting the disparity in how the justice system has handled the two cases. "This isn’t about enforcing the law equally,” Kelly said. "It’s about punishing political dissent.” She called for a comprehensive review and potential pardons for those prosecuted for January 6th, asserting that the DOJ’s actions have been politically motivated and destructive to the justice system’s credibility.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly engaged in a detailed critique of key individuals and institutions they allege are responsible for politically motivated prosecutions following January 6. The discussion highlighted figures such as Attorney General Merrick Garland, Deputy AG Lisa Monaco, and U.S. Attorney for D.C., Matthew Graves, accusing them of weaponizing legal proceedings against Donald Trump and his supporters. Graves was singled out as a central figure in pursuing harsh sentences, including those for “seditious conspiracy” and obstruction charges, which Kelly argued were politically driven and unprecedented for non-violent offenders. They examined Graves’ connections, notably his ties to the Biden administration and his wife’s involvement in left-wing activism, claiming systemic bias. The conversation also addressed judges overseeing January 6 cases, emphasizing Judge Amit Mehta and others who allowed stringent charges and excessive sentences, suggesting a broader judicial alignment with the prosecution’s agenda. Bannon and Kelly linked these actions to a strategy aimed at discrediting Trump and MAGA supporters. The conversation concluded with a vow to expose these individuals publicly and hold them accountable post-2025. Bannon warned law firms against hiring Graves, pledging to organize protests and campaigns against such moves. The dialogue framed the ongoing prosecutions as a violation of constitutional rights, likening them to authoritarian show trials, while emphasizing Trump’s potential to overturn these actions upon reelection. Kelly’s investigative work on these cases was also promoted as a resource for uncovering perceived injustices. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Part Four:   In this conversation between Steve Bannon and Sheriff Mack, they discussed strategies for addressing illegal immigration and the role of Constitutional sheriffs in implementing humane deportation policies. Sheriff Mack emphasized that while the military could assist at the border, sheriffs are uniquely positioned to identify and address immigration issues locally. He highlighted the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of relying on sheriffs’ localized knowledge rather than complex federal operations. Sheriff Mack criticized the Biden administration’s border policies and sanctuary city practices, calling for accountability and prosecution of officials aiding illegal immigration. He praised President Trump’s courage and forward planning, expressing support for a Constitutional approach to law enforcement and immigration reform. Mack also warned against poor administrative appointments, such as a Florida sheriff he deemed unqualified for a federal role, urging Trump to prioritize experienced Constitutional sheriffs. Bannon and Mack agreed on the importance of coordinated efforts, with sheriffs playing a central role in ensuring community safety and effective immigration control. Bannon highlighted Trump’s bold economic and trade policies as complementary to border security, emphasizing tariffs as leverage to influence foreign governments’ actions on immigration and drug trafficking.

The Friday WarRoom conversation between Steve Bannon and Mark Lucas centered around supporting Pete Hegseth’s nomination and the broader effort to push grassroots advocacy for conservative causes. Bannon emphasized the importance of resilience in leadership, highlighting Hegseth’s ability to withstand criticism and deliver results. He praised grassroots organizations like Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) for their effectiveness in driving policy changes under Hegseth’s leadership, such as significant VA reforms during Trump’s presidency. Lucas detailed the success of the Article 3 Project’s Action Center, which mobilized grassroots support for confirmations like Kash Patel’s and is now rallying for Hegseth. He encouraged activists to use the platform to contact senators in support of Hegseth. Lucas countered media narratives that criticized Hegseth’s tenure at CVA, asserting that his leadership left a strong foundation that facilitated significant legislative victories. The discussion also touched on media misrepresentation and the challenges of navigating political opposition. Bannon and Lucas stressed the importance of conservative media and advocacy groups in countering misinformation and advancing their agenda. They credited Hegseth’s vision and organizational skills with shaping key early victories for Trump, such as VA accountability reforms. Bannon concluded by reiterating the need for sustained grassroots engagement and media presence to combat left-wing narratives and support key conservative figures. Both speakers underscored the value of strategic grassroots efforts in achieving political goals. Part One:  Part Two:  Natalie Winters reacted to the tactics of the Democrats.  Part Two:  Steve Bannon discussed his support for Mike Benz in constructing the administrative state.  In a wide-ranging discussion, Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec analyzed recent political developments involving Senator Joni Ernst, Pete Hegseth, and Kash Patel, framing them as part of a broader populist movement against entrenched bureaucratic systems. They highlighted Joni Ernst’s pivotal role in advocating for fair hearings, particularly for Pete Hegseth, whose nomination faced widespread media skepticism but gained momentum through grassroots and MAGA support. Despite media claims of his defeat, Hegseth continues to rally backing, including from Ernst, showcasing the power of organized populist advocacy. The conversation pivoted to Kash Patel, whose candidacy as FBI Director has drawn endorsements from law enforcement groups and national security experts. Bannon and Posobiec praised Patel’s experience and contrasted it with prominent political figures like Kamala Harris. They emphasized that the establishment fears accountability, citing preemptive pardon discussions for figures like Mark Milley and Dr. Fauci as a reaction to the potential reforms Patel represents. The discussion closed with breaking news of the resignation of a Navy JAG involved in controversial COVID policies, interpreted as a sign of growing accountability. Bannon and Posobiec portrayed these developments as victories for their movement, signaling a shift in the balance of power.  Naomi Wolf discussed the media’s tactics of using illnesses like the Bird Flu to distract from political events that they did not want to see elevated.  In this conversation, Dan Fluette and Steve Bannon discussed the latest developments surrounding the film and book projects they have been working on. Fluette highlighted the impact of their film, which focuses on Kash Patel’s candidacy for FBI Director. According to Fluette, the film goes beyond a typical election call-to-action film, delving into the corruption within the FBI and other government agencies. Fluette emphasized that watching the film would not only provide a deep understanding of the inner workings of the Deep State, but also give insight into Patel’s qualifications and the mandate he would bring to clean up these agencies. Fluette suggested that people watch the film as it is an essential tool for understanding why Patel is the best candidate for FBI Director and why his expertise is crucial for the future. Fluette further noted the popularity of the film among political staffers, who find it easier to consume in under an hour compared to reading books. He stressed that this film is especially timely, as it lays out the actionable information that Patel would use to reform the FBI. Fluette recommended viewers download the film over the weekend and share it with others to better understand the significance of the issues at hand. Shifting gears, Fluette and Bannon also discussed a book titled The Pictorial History of the War Room. Bannon praised the photography and writing in the book, calling it a stunning collection that showcases the spirit and heroes of the War Room program. Fluette explained that the book was intended not just as a political statement but as a work of art—designed to stand alongside the best coffee table books. He expressed hope that readers would appreciate the book as both a visual and historical document that celebrates the power of alternative media in shaping modern political discourse. Fluette emphasized that the book is not just a gift for War Room supporters but also a historical record of the times they are living in. He suggested that people buy multiple copies to give as Christmas gifts and noted that it has already become a popular item for this purpose. For those interested in obtaining the book, Fluette directed them to Amazon and Barnes & Noble. He also provided his social media handles for further updates and encouraged followers to stay connected. In conclusion, Fluette and Bannon both expressed their excitement for upcoming events, including one in Washington, D.C., and highlighted the major influence their projects are having on the political landscape.

Natalie Winters highlighted the numerous successes of the WarRoom audience.  Joe Allen discussed the most recent details known about the Assassin who killed the United HealthCare CEO in New York City in early December.  Natalie Winters talked to Mike Benz about the details of his investigation into the overthrow of Assad and his leadership in Syria.  Julie Kelly talked about the shocking case of an 81 year old who attended events at the US Capitol on Jan 6 2021 and who was sentenced to one year confinement in a Federal Prison.  Jacqueline Tobroff talked about the Acquittal of Daniel Penny, who stood trial for killing a man in New York City.  Steve Bannon and Yoram Hazony discussed pivotal geopolitical shifts in the Middle East and their implications. Bannon noted the escalating pressure on the Iranian regime following a series of setbacks, including the weakening of its proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, as well as the Assad regime in Syria. Hazony attributed these developments to decisive military actions by Israel under Prime Minister Netanyahu, which demonstrated the viability of a military strategy against Iran’s regional ambitions. Hazony outlined three key coalitions shaping the Middle East. The first is Iran’s axis, comprising Iraq, Yemen, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The second is led by Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who aims to resurrect the Ottoman Empire and establish a Sunni caliphate, supported by Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. Hazony stressed Erdoğan’s antagonism toward pro-Western Gulf monarchies, highlighting his ambitions to control Mecca, Gulf oil wealth, and Jerusalem. The third coalition consists of Israel and moderate Arab regimes in the Gulf, united against both Iranian expansionism and Erdoğan’s Islamist aspirations. Hazony warned that Iran’s decline could inadvertently empower Erdoğan, whose ambitions pose a significant threat to regional stability and could embolden Muslim Brotherhood movements globally, including in Europe and the U.S. Both commentators underscored the high stakes of this geopolitical struggle, cautioning against leaving a power vacuum that could enable authoritarian or Islamist forces to dominate the region.  Part Two:  In their conversation, Steve Bannon and Cynthia Hughes passionately discussed the plight of January 6th detainees and broader issues of governmental “weaponization.” Hughes noted that President Trump, channeling the frustration of advocates like herself and others, has committed to providing immediate relief for these detainees upon taking office, though achieving this will face resistance in Congress. Hughes highlighted the dire circumstances faced by nearly 350 individuals jailed for their roles in the January 6th events. Many have endured nearly four years in prison, faced exorbitant legal costs, and suffered irreparable personal losses, such as broken marriages and estranged families. She detailed the case of Julian Khater, who, despite his prolonged imprisonment and harsh treatment, remains emblematic of what many detainees endure. Hughes stressed that systemic mistreatment in prison, including torturous conditions, cannot go unaccounted for. Bannon echoed this sentiment, calling for justice and accountability for those who orchestrated and allowed such treatment. He emphasized the moral obligation to prevent such abuses from recurring, tying this responsibility to America’s constitutional principles and revolutionary heritage. Both underscored the necessity of pardons but acknowledged that many detainees also face extensive civil litigation, requiring sustained support. Hughes also described her group’s ongoing efforts to provide legal, financial, and emotional assistance to detainees and their families, particularly during the holiday season, as many families face their fourth Christmas apart. They stressed the need for broader public awareness and action to combat governmental overreach and restore justice.  In their conversation, Steve Bannon and Nicole Nogrady reflected on the inspiration behind her song, Modern Day Holy War, which stemmed from the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019. NoGrady recalled watching the flames consume the historic landmark, describing the moment as a “lightning strike” of divine inspiration. The phrase “modern day holy war” came to her almost instantly, prompting her to begin crafting the song, though the process of writing and producing it took years to complete. NoGrady noted the significance of the song’s release, which coincided with the one-year anniversary of its debut on Bannon’s show and the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral five years after the fire. She described the timing as divinely orchestrated, aligning with global events and themes of religious and cultural struggle. Bannon expanded on the broader context of modern-day holy wars, referencing historical and ongoing conflicts in regions like Syria, the re-emergence of Turkish ambitions for an Ottoman revival, and tensions involving Persian Islamic supremacy. He framed these struggles as reflective of a spiritual battle tied to the birthplace of Christianity, especially poignant during the Christmas season. To conclude the discussion, Bannon praised NoGrady’s work, emphasizing its spiritual and cultural resonance. The segment closed with the full airing of Modern Day Holy War to mark its anniversary, underscoring its enduring message of faith and resilience.

WarRoom panel discussions, on the day of President Trump’s historic inauguration, blended political commentary, real-time updates, and historical reflection. With Trump’s motorcade en route to the Capitol, the broadcast provided an intimate look at the unfolding events and their broader implications. As President Trump headed to the Rotunda for a ceremony unprecedented since Reagan’s second inauguration, panelists celebrated the grandeur of the day. They highlighted the symbolic importance of the event, emphasizing unity through the mandate given by the American electorate in November 2024. Trump’s upcoming inaugural address was anticipated to focus on "sunlit uplands,” a vision for a reinvigorated nation after recent political turbulence. The discussions also delved into logistical challenges, including heightened security measures attributed to concerns over potential clashes between Antifa and right-wing groups. Analysts criticized what they perceived as the administrative state’s effort to diminish the event’s visibility, reflecting broader resistance to Trump’s leadership. Historical comparisons were drawn to past confrontations with Antifa, noting the violent protests at the 2017 "Deploraball.” Panelists lauded the day as a testament to the resilience of Trump’s movement, symbolized by a diverse crowd of MAGA supporters braving the elements to celebrate. Commentators like John Solomon dissected the intelligence state’s role in framing security concerns, asserting that such narratives aimed to minimize public participation and sow doubt about Trump’s legitimacy. Amid the pageantry, attention shifted to Trump’s imminent actions as president. His plans to issue nearly 100 executive orders were framed as a bold assertion of authority to counter resistance from entrenched bureaucracies. This aggressive policy agenda was heralded as the dawn of a transformative era. Historical and architectural references enriched the commentary, from the "brutalist” FBI headquarters symbolizing institutional decay to the Vatican-inspired artistry of the Capitol Dome. Such allusions underscored the day’s significance as a confluence of tradition and renewal. Ultimately, the panel projected optimism about Trump’s potential to unify the nation, despite ongoing opposition. As the motorcade arrived, commentators rallied viewers to witness a pivotal moment in American history, marked by the enduring spirit of democracy and the promise of change.

Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the inadequate response to natural disasters in Appalachia, including areas of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Bergquam highlighted the struggles of hurricane survivors who have been living in tents during harsh winters due to FEMA’s slow and ineffective response. While FEMA provided some hotel vouchers and assistance, much of the relief effort came from donations and grassroots organizations, as government aid fell short. Bergquam expressed frustration with bureaucratic red tape, stating, “I’ll ask for forgiveness before I ask for permission,” emphasizing the need to bypass ineffective systems to help those in need. Bergquam criticized the Biden administration for neglecting American citizens while prioritizing aid for illegal immigrants. He reported from a Chicago hotel where newly arrived migrants received warm accommodations, meals, cash cards, and other benefits, contrasting it with the dire conditions faced by hurricane survivors in Appalachia. Bergquam accused the administration of orchestrating what he called a “highly organized invasion” that prioritized migrants over U.S. citizens. He emphasized that communities in Appalachia had to rely on their own efforts, such as grassroots groups like the Appalachian United Initiative, to provide relief and rebuild. Bannon and Bergquam also discussed the broader political implications, tying the Biden administration’s policies to the suffering of Americans in neglected regions. They noted that President Trump had prioritized these areas by visiting North Carolina and showing support for disaster-stricken communities. Bergquam asserted that Trump’s leadership marked the end of neglect and a renewed focus on putting Americans first. The segment emphasized the stark divide between grassroots resilience and perceived government failures under the current administration.  Ben Bergquam and Brian Glenn join Steve Bannon to talk about what they expect from the press event with President Trump in North Carolina.  Glenn and Bannon add commentary and exclusive video footage of Trump’s comments at the airport and at the following gathering with North Carolina officials.  President Trump, speaking in North Carolina, criticized FEMA for its inefficiency in disaster recovery, pledging to expedite relief efforts and suggesting states should handle such crises directly for faster, more cost-effective results. He contrasted this with California, highlighting severe mismanagement of water resources and calling for policies to restore water to farmlands and cities. On the Ukraine conflict, Trump described the war as tragic and avoidable, asserting it would not have occurred under his leadership and suggesting that lowering oil prices could pressure Russia to end the war. He emphasized his “America First” agenda, advocating for voter ID laws, addressing sanctuary city policies, and prioritizing domestic issues like disaster recovery and resource management to support states and ensure election integrity.  President Trump criticized FEMA for its inadequate response to North Carolina’s disaster recovery, citing bureaucratic inefficiency, slow action, and high costs. He highlighted severe water and wind damage across the state, emphasizing the devastating impact on communities, including Asheville, which went without running water for two months. Trump pledged to take strong action to expedite relief efforts, proposing reforms or potentially dismantling FEMA to allow states to manage disaster recovery directly. He argued that states, being familiar with local needs, are better equipped to handle such crises effectively. Trump expressed gratitude for the support he received during his campaign from North Carolina and commended individuals like Michael Watley, Franklin Graham, and local representatives for their contributions to recovery efforts. He acknowledged the extensive damage caused by the disaster, including 104 fatalities and the destruction of over 73,000 homes, calling it one of the worst crises he had seen. To accelerate recovery, Trump announced plans to involve the Army Corps of Engineers to address river breaks and infrastructure issues. He assured residents that North Carolina would rebuild stronger and better, highlighting his commitment to supporting the state. Trump’s remarks underscored his dissatisfaction with FEMA and his vision for a more efficient, state-led approach to disaster recovery.

Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam’s discussion highlights the challenges of deporting illegal immigrants from sanctuary cities like Chicago, where local and state officials refuse to cooperate with ICE. Bannon referenced past successes under Trump, urging immediate action to address Central American countries’ responses and Columbia’s ongoing negotiations. Bergquam, reporting from Chicago, described the obstacles ICE faces in deporting criminal aliens due to state and city policies that block ICE detainers. These policies force ICE to track down dangerous individuals in communities, creating risks for agents and the public. Bannon criticized officials like Chicago’s mayor and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for enabling lawlessness by releasing criminal aliens back into communities. Bergquam noted that ICE agents were shocked by the severity of the situation, with hundreds of detainees being held but not released to ICE. Both predicted federal actions, including potential defunding of sanctuary cities, as a response. Bannon called for stronger enforcement and a crackdown on uncooperative officials, arguing that public safety and national security demand immediate action. Bergquam shared firsthand experiences of ICE operations, highlighting bureaucratic hurdles and the urgent need for systemic reform to address what they see as deliberate obstruction of immigration enforcement. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the ongoing detention of Tyler Burleson, who remains in Unicoi County Jail without being arraigned for over a week. Burleson, allegedly held on to an insufficient check charge, revealed that the business involved wasn’t pressing charges and that the check was resolved before his arrest. He claims his detention stems from local authorities targeting him, notably after he opened a community distribution center without seeking permission. Burleson accused Detective Tony Buchanan and D.A. Justin Iraq of unjust actions, alleging personal bias and a deliberate effort to keep him jailed. He also stated that Mayor Glenn White opposed the distribution center, reflecting tensions between his efforts to aid the community and local government officials. Burleson expressed frustration at being cut off from outside communication and having limited access to visitation or updates. Bannon pledged to investigate the situation and spotlight the authorities involved, suggesting political motivations behind the arrest. The conversation emphasized Burleson’s belief that his detention is an attempt to suppress his work and keep him from supporting President Trump during his recent visit to the region. Bannon and Bergquam vowed to seek justice and accountability.  Eli Crane joined Steve Bannon to discuss the reconciliation process and its challenges. Crane expressed concern over the Republican conference’s preference for a single comprehensive bill, which he believes is risky and inefficient. He emphasized the need for immediate wins, mainly to fund Tom Homan and border security efforts, as delays could lead to more American lives being lost due to illegal immigration. Crane highlighted the logistical difficulties of passing a single massive bill, which would allow the mainstream media to push anti-deportation narratives, weaken moderate Republicans, and stall meaningful border security and deportation measures. Bannon supported Crane’s argument, pointing out that the complexity of a hefty bill would delay progress until mid-2024, leaving immigration reform vulnerable to opposition from the media, deep state, and administrative state. He criticized the lack of preparation for a two-bill approach and warned that the one-bill strategy would give adversaries time to undermine Trump’s immigration agenda. Crane and Bannon agreed that the deep state and administrative state are actively resisting Trump’s plans, including funding for deportation efforts. They noted that ICE agents could become targets of media campaigns designed to generate emotional backlash, which would pressure moderate Republicans to withdraw support. Additionally, Crane addressed the broader fiscal challenges, including looming government shutdowns and deficits. He criticized proposals like the Freedom Caucus’ plan to increase the debt ceiling by $4 trillion over two years, signaling two trillion-dollar annual deficits. Both Crane and Bannon stressed the importance of Republicans standing firm on fiscal discipline while ensuring Trump receives the resources necessary for border security and deportations.  Mercedes Schlapp joined Steve Bannon on War Room to emphasize the importance of the upcoming CPAC conference at National Harbor. Schlapp described CPAC as the premier gathering for conservatives, offering Americans and international leaders a platform to unite, strategize, and celebrate President Trump’s victories. Schlapp highlighted CPAC’s global reach, noting its influence in countries like Argentina, Japan, Brazil, and Australia, where it supports conservative movements against communism and globalism. She explained how these nations are inspired by Trump’s leadership and seek to replicate his America First policies in their own regions. This year’s CPAC theme, "America is Winning,” is about the urgency of implementing Trump’s agenda quickly. Schlapp stressed that conservatives must stay focused and act decisively to overcome opposition from legacy media and reorganize Democrats. With tickets priced at $76 using the promo code "WarRoom,” CPAC aims to attract a massive turnout. Schlapp called it a chance to celebrate victories and prepare for upcoming battles at the local, state, and federal levels. She encouraged all patriots to join this critical event and play a role in shaping the future.  Steve Bannon and Marc Beckman, an NYU professor and author on AI, discussed the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and its implications. Bannon expressed skepticism about the growing influence of Chinese technology, particularly DeepSeek, a new AI app gaining popularity in the U.S. He warned that, like TikTok, it could collect massive amounts of data from users, raising concerns about privacy and security. Beckman acknowledged these risks but pointed out that DeepSeek is a sophisticated tool, and the Chinese government’s investment in AI could outpace U.S. efforts. He also highlighted the growing use of AI in cyber attacks, particularly from China, targeting U.S. infrastructure. While Beckman expressed optimism about AI’s potential, especially in fields like fashion, finance, and military, he also shared concerns about its dangers, such as privacy violations and the increasing use of facial recognition technology. His book, Some Future Day, aims to help readers leverage AI for career advancement but also addresses these risks. Bannon, ever cautious, questioned the long-term effects of letting foreign powers control such technology. Beckman also discussed the real-world applications of AI, noting its growing presence in various industries while emphasizing the need for safe, responsible development.   Joe Allen and Steve Bannon discuss the intersection of technology, AI, and the future of global power, focusing on the potential threat China poses. Allen acknowledges the complex nature of the situation, describing the recent rise of the Chinese company DeepSeek’s AI model, which has been open-sourced and quickly adopted by American users, resulting in sensitive data being sent to Chinese servers. Bannon warns that this represents a significant challenge to American tech dominance compared to TikTok’s impact. The conversation turns to the energy demands of AI, particularly regarding large-scale models, and the shift in priorities where the focus has moved away from climate change to securing massive energy supplies to drive technological advances. Allen and Bannon agree that this moment is a hybrid of a "Sputnik moment” and a psyop, with China leveraging its AI advancements to assert dominance while manipulating global perceptions. They also discuss the accelerating race to develop AI, spurred by competition between U.S. and Chinese tech leaders. While some American tech figures push for rapid AI development, the conversation reflects deep concerns over data security, the broader geopolitical struggle, and the potential societal consequences of AI’s unchecked growth.  Steve Bannon and Maureen Bannon discuss exciting details about upcoming events, including the CPAC conference and the Force Multiplier Academy, which will take place at the Gaylord National Harbor on February 19. Steve invites War Room Posse members to attend, offering an exclusive discounted CPAC ticket at $76 (normally $95). To attend the Force Multiplier Academy, attendees must have a valid CPAC ticket. The academy promises impactful speakers and sessions, with updates on room details to be shared soon. Steve encourages participation, highlighting the presence of key speakers and War Room’s active role in the event. They also mention Real America’s Voice, which will provide extensive coverage, including appearances by notable figures like John Solomon and Natalie Winters. Steve shares the ambition of making the event accessible and encourages the audience to attend both CPAC and the Force Multiplier Academy. He also emphasizes the importance of supporting War Room by sharing content, signing up for free resources, and engaging with sponsors, whom they’ve chosen for their valuable information and relationship-building. Steve reiterates War Room’s commitment to remaining free of paywalls and making content widely available to reach the American public. He concludes by urging listeners to secure their CPAC tickets via cpac.org and register for the Force Multiplier Academy at the provided event link.

Steve Bannon emphasized that Trump campaigned to hold his enemies accountable, and his supporters backed that vision. He criticized DOJ staff tied to January 6th cases, claiming they’re being targeted for removal despite civil service protections. Bannon highlighted Trump’s aggressive actions to overhaul agencies like the FDIC, which ensures bank deposits, framing it as part of the MAGA agenda. Bannon criticized mainstream media like CNN, calling them irrelevant, and slammed officials like Greg Abbott for performative leadership on border issues. He called for mass deportations, stating all 12-15 million illegal immigrants must leave to restore the community and protect resources for working-class Americans. He insisted this effort should be firm but empathetic, emphasizing no debate. Bannon praised Trump’s idea to send repeat criminals to foreign prisons, believing it would reduce crime. He also supported Trump’s broader moves, from deploying troops to revamping agencies, and lauded figures like Kristi Noem for bold actions. Bannon urged MAGA supporters to stay focused on the larger mission of systemic reform, criticizing overselling of immediate victories and calling for a long-term commitment to the movement’s goals. His tone remained defiant, framing MAGA as unstoppable and essential for saving America.  Steve Bannon interviewed Raheem Kassam about the culture of MAGA and his new restaurant venture in Washington, DC.  Steve Bannon dives deep into the relationship between Obama, Biden, Wall Street, and Big Tech. He calls Obama and Biden “reactionary” presidents, masking their actions as “progressive” through performative optics. Bannon claims Obama made a deal with Silicon Valley at a San Francisco airport, empowering platforms like Facebook to crush the Clintons and establish monopolistic power. This marked a shift from capitalism to a system of monopolies and rent-seeking, dominated by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Bannon highlights how Wall Street and Silicon Valley created an oligarchy, abandoning ordinary Americans. He points to the 2008 financial bailout as a moment when elites saved themselves while leaving the little guy to suffer. This fueled a populist backlash that led to Trump’s 2016 victory. Big Tech, according to Bannon, now suppresses dissent, ensuring their platforms push progressive agendas while silencing voices like Breitbart. He argues that the age of the algorithm, dominated by Silicon Valley, has stifled true innovation. Meanwhile, China’s TikTok and AI advancements have outpaced the U.S., leaving the country vulnerable. Bannon’s core message: the elites sold out the American people, creating monopolies and abandoning traditional values for their gain.  Steve Bannon talked to Natalie Winters from the White House.  Steve Bannon and Frank Gaffney discussed the growing challenges in the Middle East. They focused on the actions of Turkey, Iran, and Qatar. Bannon warned about Turkey’s push to revive the Ottoman Empire under Erdogan, calling him aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. He urged the U.S. to label the group a terrorist organization. Bannon stressed the importance of addressing radical Islamic supremacism. But he cautioned against rushing into unnecessary wars. He believes the U.S. needs a clear strategy that avoids looking weak or reckless. Gaffney praised Bannon’s efforts to expose these threats. He mentioned Trump’s 2016 agenda to fight “radical Islamic terrorism” through strength and decisive action. Gaffney introduced resources like VictoryCo.org and GateStone Institute to help educate the public on these issues. Both agreed that the U.S. must stay focused on its interests. They emphasized balancing restraint with strength. For them, the key is understanding the region’s players and their ambitions.

Sen. Rand Paul praises Kennedy as a disruptor in this segment, which is necessary because public health has been mismanaged for years, citing the misleading food pyramid as an example he said. He highlights Kennedy’s breadth of knowledge and his advocacy for transparency and open discussion about medical risks and benefits, especially concerning the COVID-19 vaccine. Paul criticizes the government for not being honest about the vaccine’s risks versus benefits for different age groups, suggesting that the advice given was not tailored to individual risk levels. He points out that the government’s approach, including mandates, misinformation on masks, and social distancing, has led to public distrust. Steve Bannon questions if the misinformation was intentional. Paul responds by suggesting that authorities knew the truth but chose to mislead the public under the guise of a ‘noble lie’, thinking it would benefit society. The conversation shifts to strategies for tackling the influence of Big Pharma. Paul suggests separating pharmaceutical companies from their regulatory influence, using the example of government and pharmaceutical companies sharing patents on the mRNA vaccine. He argues for better transparency to restore trust in government health advice. The discussion ends with Paul promising continued scrutiny over figures like Anthony Fauci, particularly regarding the virus’s origins and the handling of related research, indicating ongoing investigations and a commitment to transparency.  Robert F. Kennedy appeared before a Senate hearing for his nomination by President Trump for Health secretary.  Megyn Kelly joined Steve Bannon to discuss Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s (RFK Jr.) performance at his Senate confirmation hearing. Kelly noted that although the hearing was tough, RFK Jr. handled the situation well despite the aggressive questioning. She remarked that Senator Cassidy particularly challenged him on issues like Medicare and Medicaid, where technical questions were used to make him appear unprepared potentially. However, she felt that RFK Jr. managed to articulate his positions, especially on environmental toxins, which Trump selected him to address. Kelly defended RFK Jr. against accusations of being anti-vaccine, clarifying that he does not advocate for banning vaccines but opposes mandatory vaccinations. She and Bannon then discussed the broader implications of RFK Jr.’s nomination, highlighting the opposition from influential figures like Elizabeth Warren, whom they accused of being financially tied to Big Pharma. Bannon and Kelly also touched on the strategies RFK Jr. could use in future hearings, suggesting he should be more aggressive and capitalize on his strengths, like his litigation experience and knowledge of environmental issues. They emphasized the importance of his nomination in fighting against the influence of Big Pharma, expressing concerns about corruption within regulatory bodies like the FDA. The conversation also veered into personal anecdotes about RFK Jr., including his family dynamics and public persona, with Kelly mentioning his vocal cord issues, which sometimes affected his speaking capabilities. They concluded by discussing the political strategy President Trump should employ to ensure RFK Jr.’s confirmation, suggesting Trump should actively whip votes to support his nominee, given the significance of RFK Jr.’s role in addressing health and environmental issues. The dialogue was punctuated by their mutual support for RFK Jr., despite acknowledging his eccentricities and a shared skepticism of the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over politics and health policy. Part One:  Part Two:  Brian Glenn and Steve Bannon discussed the recent OMB memo, its media reception, and broader political strategies. Bannon noted that the memo, while standard, triggered a firestorm from the left. Glenn highlighted Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt’s firm response, dismissing media narratives about funding cuts to critical programs, reinforcing her no-nonsense approach. Bannon questioned whether the administration showed weakness, but Glenn assured that Trump’s team remains aggressive, with daily briefings from either Leavitt or Trump himself. Glenn also noted that experienced White House reporters had never seen such direct responses from an administration. Looking ahead, they emphasized the urgency of aligning the House with Trump’s agenda, as policy battles over debt, deficits, and taxes loom. Bannon stressed that process—not just policy—is crucial, given constitutional constraints on spending. Trump’s actions, including moves on immigration and reallocating unspent Green New Deal funds, were framed as bold, demonstrating executive authority. Glenn highlighted Trump’s direct approach with foreign governments on deportation, reinforcing his tough stance. Bannon concluded that Trump is "winning everywhere” but warned against strategic missteps that could hand the opposition a rallying point. He emphasized that this is a "testing period” for aggressive governance, urging continued momentum without hesitation.  Steve Bannon talked about the action steps needed to help secure the nomination of President Trump.  Mary Holland talked about the MAHA movement of supporters behind Robert Kennedy Jr.  Kari Lake talked to Steve Bannon about the “mama bear” movement behind Robert Kennedy Jr and why she supports his nomination.  Lake also shared the perspective of the Moms who feel betrayed by the food and medical industry.  Lake thought he Kennedy did very well and predicted he will be nominated.  Natalie WInters gave a live report from the White House.  Jim Rickards talked about President Trump’s numerous executive actions since getting sworn in.  Steve Bannon talked to George Papadopoulos and his wife, Simona Mangiante about their new podcast.

HIGHLIGHTS: Wednesday’s show explored MSNBC’s turmoil over Ronna McDaniels’s brief tenure and the rescinding of Rhonda Romney McDaniel’s hiring, inciting reactions from Universal News Group staff.  Host Steve Bannon dissected Trump’s appeal to working-class Democrats and the establishment’s backlash. Discussions also touched on immigration’s impact on housing and the pushback against EV regulations, highlighting ongoing political battles. From concerns over illegal immigrant housing to strategies for the 2024 election, the show offered a panoramic view of America’s political landscape. As Bannon emphasized the need for grassroots resistance, guests like Louis Murray and Catherine O’Neill brought local activism and entrepreneurial spirit to the forefront, reflecting diverse perspectives. Natalie Winters and Brittany Martinez discussed Evie Magazine’s scrutiny over birth control side effects, attributing it to political agendas and censorship and she spoke with Dave Walsh about energy policies Americans need to focus on. Full show in segments: Wednesday’s night show opened with a clip of MSNBC talking heads discussing the devolution of Ronna McDaniels’s employment at the network, lasting less than two days, without fury raging through the MSNBC crew.  The show opens with a discussion about a memo circulated within Universal News Group, authored by Conde, announcing the rescinding of Rhonda Romney McDaniel’s hiring, causing solid reactions among employees, including Joe Ried and Rachel Madow. MSNBC’s Charlie Sykes appeared in the clip, highlighting the establishment’s opposition to Trump, rallying behind Biden, while working-class Democrats are embracing Trump’s disruptive message, as Bannon pointed out. Bannon said voters would focus on the convergence of crises, referring to US southern border issues, federal spending, and geopolitical tensions, adding that those issues would fuel the working class’s support for Trump. Bannon talked about how the establishment, symbolized by figures like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, faces rejection by the new Republican base. The establishment’s strategy, underscored by recent efforts in Ukraine, relies on unconventional methods, potentially involving legal maneuvers orchestrated by Obama-era officials. Bannon pointed to reports that suggest Obama’s direct involvement in White House affairs, indicating a concerted effort to counter Trump’s resurgence, with Matthew Calandra playing a pivotal role. This intricate web of political maneuvering underscores the ongoing power struggle within the Republican Party and the broader political landscape.  Outside the Massachusetts State Capitol, as Bannon interviewed him, a group of about 25 individuals, including Lou Murray, is taking an early lunch break amid concerns over the state budget. Layoffs of teachers are imminent in four primary school systems. At the same time, the government plans to allocate an additional two billion dollars towards housing illegal immigrants in hotels, exploiting the state’s right-to-shelter policy. According to recent statistics, the immigration influx, numbering around 288,000, exacerbates the existing housing crisis and strains public resources. Residents who witness their tax dollars being funneled into providing free services for immigrants while essential community resources suffer grow dissatisfied. Murray discussed concerns that community centers are being displaced from urban areas to affluent suburbs. However, Murray told Bannon that efforts to raise awareness and mobilize action face challenges, including the co-optation of activists and community leaders. Murray said Governor Moore Healy’s recent announcement of tolls on commuters crossing the Cape Cod Canal adds to the economic burdens of blue-collar workers traveling to Boston for employment. Despite these challenges, grassroots activism persists, with individuals like Murray advocating for change and utilizing social media platforms like Twitter to amplify their voices and engage with the broader community.  In the following segment, Bannon said the opposition’s strategy revolves around allocating two billion dollars to challenge Trump in battleground states, focusing on 25 critical counties. Biden intends to leverage administrative power, including the deep state and a massive propaganda machine, to sway public opinion. Despite missed opportunities, such as not utilizing Danielle Pletka effectively, aiming to delegitimize Biden’s presidency, recognizing growing discontent among Americans, particularly regarding immigration policies and the southern border crisis. The media is a vital tool in propaganda efforts, controlled by powerful interests in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and corporate elites. However, Bannon says, grassroots movements continue to resist, emphasizing the rigged nature of the political system and the need for accountability. Bannon anticipates turbulent times ahead but remains committed to exposing and confronting the corruption within the establishment.  Bannon talked about the frustration with the situation in New York around Trump’s lawfare cases and added the dangers posed by illegal immigration, citing a case where an illegal immigrant on TikTok instructed others on how to squat in the country. Bannon criticizes the Biden administration’s handling of immigration issues, seeing it as part of a broader effort to transform America. Despite recognizing Trump’s efforts, he stressed the need for collective action and volunteerism to counter the opposition’s tactics, which include legal maneuvers and propaganda. Bannon argued that Trump’s policies are vital for restoring America’s prosperity and security, contrasting them with what they perceive as the opposition’s nostalgia trap. The speaker emphasizes resilience in the face of challenges and vows to continue fighting against perceived injustices and corruption within the establishment.  Mike Davis talked about the judge overseeing Trump’s financial case who has issued a gag order following Trump’s public statements, deeming them threatening and inflammatory. The judge expressed concern about potential witness intimidation. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Obama is exerting influence over Biden’s administration, aiming to prosecute Trump. Matthew Colangelo, from the Biden Justice Department, is tasked with leading the case against Trump, which some see as politically motivated. The prosecution aims to vilify Trump, focusing on issues related to women and portraying him as a misogynist. Critics argue that this case infringes on Trump’s First Amendment and due process rights and suspect a broader conspiracy against Trump. Despite skepticism, the speaker believes that Trump’s resilience will prevail, and they call for continued advocacy to support Trump’s cause.  Despite Donald Trump’s apparent control over the Republican Party and its grassroots support, there is notable dissent within the party’s ranks, particularly among prominent figures like senators and former party leaders. Many senators, including Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney, have publicly stated their refusal to support Trump’s bid for re-election. This level of opposition from within the party is unprecedented in American history, with only Sarah Palin among recent Republican nominees publicly supporting Trump. In the clip Bannon shows, there is a suggestion that Trump’s control of the party may not be as absolute as it seems, pointing to these cracks in his support.  Catherine O’Neill, a former White House and State Department member, joins the discussion with Bannon. She expresses her commitment to fighting for clean and healthy food supplies amid challenges from large food corporations promoting radical environmentalism. She highlights her company, Meriweather Farms, based in Wyoming, which offers high-quality beef products. O’Neill emphasizes their dedication to providing various affordable options and encourages people to visit their website, www.maryweatherfarms.com, to learn more and place orders. Steve Bannon praises her entrepreneurial spirit and encourages listeners to support her efforts.  Steve Bannon discusses the strategies opponents employ to undermine Trump’s influence and the upcoming joint efforts of the Democratic Party, led by Obama, to counter Trump’s expanding coalition. He highlights concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election and criticizes Jim Jordan’s response to questions about it. Bannon emphasizes the importance of defending the constitutional republic and restoring stability and prosperity under Trump’s leadership. He concludes by expressing pride in the individuals and brands aligned with Trump’s cause.  Steve Bannon and Joshua Philipp discuss developments regarding illegal immigration and squatter rights in the United States. They highlight a video where an individual advocates for stealing homes from Americans and discusses the implications of squatter rights laws. Philipp explains the Biden administration’s role in facilitating mass illegal immigration through agreements like the Global Compact for Migration and describes the process migrants follow to enter the country. They also touch on the impact of a Chinese production aimed at influencing Americans’ perceptions of China. Throughout the conversation, they emphasize the need for awareness and action to address these issues.  Natalie Winters discusses with Brittany Martinez the attacks Evie Magazine has faced for highlighting the side effects of birth control pills. Martinez explains that the magazine began discussing these side effects in 2019, prompting backlash from both the left and the right. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, their opposition intensified, with mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, Vice, and Jezebel publishing hit pieces against them. Martinez suggests that this increased scrutiny may be tied to political agendas akin to the censorship faced during discussions about COVID-19 vaccines. She emphasizes the importance of recognizing the broader agenda behind these attacks, suggesting that they may aim to silence women’s voices and perpetuate Big Pharma’s influence. Martinez also discusses how birth control pills affect women’s hormonal cycles, potentially influencing their behavior and decision-making. She highlights the need for women to understand their cycles and challenges misconceptions about birth control and fertility. Martinez invites people to follow her on Twitter (@Britt_Martinez) and encourages them to follow Evie Magazine for more information.  Thayer discusses the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their corruption. He emphasizes the CCP’s lack of legitimacy and characterizes it as a colonial government imposed by Western intellectual colonialism. Thayer advocates for exposing the CCP’s corruption and identifying its weaknesses to pave the way for its overthrow, allowing the Chinese people to determine their own form of government. He highlights the wealth of the CCP leadership as a target for scrutiny and emphasizes the need to reveal the regime’s hypocrisy. Navarro also mentions climate engineering programs and elite capture as significant issues. He criticizes Scotland’s new hate crime law as a step toward totalitarianism, influenced by the CCP’s model of control. Navarro concludes by discussing the importance of the upcoming election in countering the CCP’s influence operations and thwarting their broader goals.  The conversation revolves around the concept of the “Great Replacement Theory” and its application in various policies, particularly in the state of Michigan. Darren Beattie discusses how this theory, often considered controversial, is grounded in truth and needs to be addressed openly. Beattie draws parallels between immigration policies, the Chinese Communist Party’s influence, and the erosion of native populations in Western countries. He highlights a policy in Michigan known as the “newcomer renter subsidy,” which effectively subsidizes renters who are recent immigrants or even illegal immigrants, criticizing the policy for favoring newcomers over native citizens, including veterans, and emphasizing the perverse nature of such government actions. The discussion also touches upon broader themes of Western derangement and the erosion of traditional values and demographics.  The conversation explores various aspects of energy policy, mainly focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources. Dave Walsh discusses recent developments in EV regulations, including proposals to mandate a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032. He critiques the efficacy of EVs, highlighting that despite being labeled as “zero emissions,” they are still powered predominantly by fossil fuels due to the energy grid’s composition. Electric power generation and transmission inefficiency is also emphasized, with comparisons made to gasoline-powered vehicles. Furthermore, the discussion addresses the environmental and geopolitical implications of transitioning to renewable energy sources. The guests expressed concerns about the dependency on China for battery production and the environmental impact of mining lithium and other materials necessary for EV batteries. They also touch upon the economic and strategic implications of energy policies in the context of global conflicts, particularly referencing the situation in Ukraine and its impact on European energy supplies. Additionally, there is criticism of the lack of understanding and depth among Congressional Republicans regarding energy issues, with a call for more excellent education on the subject. The conversation concludes with the guest providing contact information for those interested in following their work.

Steve Bannon hosted the morning program, and his guests joined in on meaningful conversations. Thursday Morning’s brief:  from March 28, 2024, covers various political discussions between US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), Steve Bannon, and other guests. MTG and Bannon discussed topics such as Larry David’s mockery of Georgia, concerns about election integrity in Georgia, criticism of the Republican establishment, dissatisfaction with Republican leadership in Congress, and calls for accountability and new leadership. There were mentions of impeachment efforts and frustration with Speaker Mike Johnson. Additionally, they discussed President Biden’s perceived connection to former President Obama, the recent government funding bill, and concerns about the treatment of attorney John Eastman. A conversation with Abe Hamadeh highlighted concerns about corruption in Arizona, particularly regarding a defamation lawsuit against Kari Lake. Lake positioned herself as a fighter against corruption, emphasizing the importance of protecting the judicial system. Dr. John Eastman discussed the perceived attack on him for questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election, criticizing the legal process and calling for accountability. Natalie Dominguez shared insights on protecting home titles, promoting HomeTitleLock.com. Lastly, Mike Lindell addressed bankruptcy rumors regarding MyPillow, emphasizing their financial stability and promoting exclusive deals for the War Room audience. Full show in segments: US Rep. Republican Majorie Taylor Greene (MTG) spoke with Steve Bannon about various political topics, including plans for a particular segment to discuss Larry David’s mockery of Georgia, concerns about election integrity in Georgia, criticism of the Republican establishment in the state, dissatisfaction with Republican leadership in Congress, and calls for accountability and new leadership. Thursday’s conversation also addressed specific examples of political maneuvering and betrayals within the Republican Party. Additionally, there are mentions of impeachment efforts and frustration with the current state of affairs under Speaker Mike Johnson. The comments between Bannon and MTG reflect a sense of urgency and dissatisfaction with the status quo, particularly those advocating for conservative principles and pushing back against perceived establishment politics.  Bannon said that the political elites and the media are shaping public opinion and supporting the Biden administration.   Abe Hamadeh appeared to talk to Steve Bannon about Kari Lake’s strategic maneuver in response to a defamation lawsuit brought against her, exploiting the legal system’s weaknesses. Despite the Supreme Court allowing the case to proceed to trial, Lake’s defaulting has caught her opponents off guard. By letting her case go into default and then requesting to see the damages owed for the alleged statement, Lake has shifted the narrative and exposed the lawsuit’s true intentions, which she claims are politically motivated. The following conversation highlights the legal system’s perceived bias and manipulation, prompting Hamadeh to call for investigation and accountability. Concerns about compromised elections and weaponized legal processes are raised, with Lake positioning herself as a fighter against corruption by Bannon.  Steve Bannon joined John Eastman to discuss Eastman’s recent disbarment recommendation and the perceived injustices in the legal process. Eastman alleges that the recommendation is filled with lies and misrepresentations, vowing to vigorously challenge it up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The conversation delves into the details of the legal proceedings, including claims of blocked witnesses and evidence. Eastman accuses the judge of bias and asserts his right to advocate for his client, arguing that reasonable legal theories were dismissed unfairly. The conversation touches on broader themes of government authority and the erosion of democratic principles, drawing parallels to historical authoritarian regimes. There’s criticism of Attorney General Bill Barr’s handling of voter fraud allegations and a call for accountability. The discussion concludes with a commitment to continue the fight against perceived injustices.  Natalie Dominguez, an education specialist on theft protection, shared a success story with Steve Bannon, highlighting the importance of safeguarding home titles. In the example Dominguez gave for how necessary these actions are,  she told Bannon about a family from Florida, who faced potential property loss due to fraudulent activity. Fortunately, they were subscribed to Home Title Lock, which alerted them to the suspicious activity and provided expert assistance in rectifying the situation. This underscores the significance of protecting home equity, which is often a homeowner’s most valuable asset. To ensure protection against such threats, viewers are encouraged to visit hometitlelock.com and utilize the promo code “war room” for a free 30-day trial and a complimentary title scan history.

She discusses a defamation lawsuit filed against her and claims it is politically motivated to undermine her candidacy.

Lindell assures that this situation does not indicate bankruptcy and emphasizes that they are not going anywhere. He then promotes exclusive deals for the War Room audience on My Pillow products, including robes, towels, pillows, and sandals. Lindell concludes by thanking the audience and promoting the website and phone number for ordering.

He told Winters that he sees this as part of a broader lawfare and election interference pattern, particularly within the DC federal courts, promising further action and oversight.  Todd Bensman discussed his article on how President Biden’s administration has influenced the Mexican President’s stance on immigration, who has suggested that he will only slow the immigration flow to the US if he receives $20 billion, highlighting the leverage he holds over the situation.

President Trump had a press conference and spoke for about 35 min. Dealing the details he had about the American Airlines crash on Wednesday night at Regan Airport.  Mary Holland and Steve Bannon discussed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s performance in his confirmation hearings, emphasizing the political and corporate resistance he faces, particularly from the pharmaceutical industry. Bannon noted that Kennedy was subjected to tough, brutal questioning, but he held his own. The hearings were not just about approval but about limiting Kennedy’s options if he were to advance. Holland highlighted the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over Congress and its hostility toward Kennedy, whom they see as a threat due to his push for transparency and independent scientific scrutiny. She described the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement as a growing political force, particularly among mothers advocating for health reforms. They also discussed Senator Bill Cassidy’s pivotal role in the Finance Committee vote, stressing the importance of grassroots pressure to secure Kennedy’s confirmation. While Cassidy adheres to mainstream medical narratives, Holland believes he is persuadable. Bannon and Holland agreed that Kennedy’s approach—focusing on transparency and gold-standard science—aligns with Trump’s vision and resonates with a broad audience. They underscored the movement’s long-term significance, framing it as a historic grassroots uprising that politicians cannot ignore without political consequences.

They underscored the movement’s long-term significance, framing it as a historic grassroots uprising that politicians cannot ignore without political consequences.  Naomi Wolf and Steve Bannon discussed the intense scrutiny and attacks RFK Jr. faced, particularly regarding vaccines and public health policies. Wolf framed the moment as a pivotal test, where political and corporate elites sought to derail him. She described the hearings as revealing a desperate, almost ritualistic opposition from Democratic senators, who seemed to be defending pharmaceutical interests at all costs rather than engaging in scientific debate. Bannon emphasized the aggressive tactics used against RFK Jr., noting the same hostility had been directed at other populist figures like Trump, Matt Gaetz, and Tulsi Gabbard. The conversation suggested the hearings were more than political theater—they exposed a deep ideological divide, where RFK Jr. stood as a lone voice against entrenched interests. Wolf noted that while RFK Jr. delivered a solid performance, the real victory lay in how the opposition revealed itself. Senators who attacked him appeared emotionally unhinged, dogmatic, and unwilling to address concerns about chronic disease and corporate influence over public health. Bannon and Wolf agreed that this moment should be leveraged by RFK Jr.’s and Trump’s teams to highlight the establishment’s irrational resistance to questioning pharmaceutical narratives. Ultimately, Wolf viewed RFK Jr.’s resilience as a spiritual battle, comparing his unwavering commitment to truth with Trump’s. She concluded that the hearings weren’t just about RFK Jr.—they exposed the broader struggle between populist truth-tellers and the institutional forces trying to silence them.  Steve Bannon and Jim Rickards discussed the recent attacks on Tulsi Gabbard during her confirmation hearing, highlighting her composed demeanor and ability to handle adversarial questioning. Rickards praised Gabbard for not falling into “gotcha” traps and emphasized that her meeting with Bashar al-Assad was a standard intelligence-gathering move rather than an endorsement. They noted that the smear tactics used against her mirrored past Democratic strategies, branding dissenters as “Russian assets” for challenging the Ukraine war narrative. Rickards asserted that Gabbard’s stance on Ukraine aligns more with reality than the mainstream U.S. intelligence community, which he accused of distorting facts to shape policy. He argued that Putin’s strategic assessment of the war is largely correct, while U.S. agencies continue to push Ukrainian propaganda. The discussion also touched on Section 702 surveillance abuses, with Gabbard advocating for reforms to prevent warrantless spying on Americans. Bannon and Rickards agreed that the intelligence community has failed at its core mission—collecting accurate intelligence—while excelling at manipulating policy decisions. They concluded that the deep state, through inter-agency influence, has overstepped its role, and a reformed approach to intelligence is necessary to restore credibility.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the ongoing confirmation hearings for key Trump nominees, analyzing media reactions and political implications. Winters noted that while figures like Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel had strong showings, media coverage seemed less panicked about RFK Jr., suggesting they may see his nomination as unlikely. She also highlighted how mainstream outlets are strategically avoiding outrage over nominees to prevent giving Republicans an advantage. Bannon pointed out how the press couldn’t resist reacting to Trump’s press conference, where he criticized “woke” hiring policies, particularly in aviation. He cited reports of a diversity-hired helicopter pilot with limited experience, arguing that such policies lead to incompetence. Winters emphasized the urgency of confirming Trump’s nominees to counteract what she described as the Biden administration’s failures. The conversation then shifted to immigration, where Winters highlighted lawsuits to block mass deportations, particularly those backed by groups like the ACLU. She criticized these efforts as taxpayer-funded resistance against enforcing immigration laws. The segment concluded with a mention of Daily Mail’s coverage of political and cultural issues, reinforcing the idea that media narratives play a crucial role in shaping public perception.

Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon discussed the details of Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation hearing.  Kassam Raheem talked to Steve Bannon about the breaking details of the news that President Trump had fired some FBI agents.  Julie Kelly and Steve Bannon discuss a major shakeup within the FBI and DOJ, describing it as a long-overdue purge of entrenched bureaucrats obstructing reform. Kelly highlights how DOJ officials were in shock after Trump’s victory, knowing their actions would come under scrutiny. She mentions that Kash Patel will play a key role in investigating and holding corrupt officials accountable, now facing fewer barriers in accessing critical evidence. They expect fierce pushback, with critics framing these actions as retaliation against career civil servants, but argue the real goal is to restore integrity by removing political bias. Kelly also discusses broader DOJ reforms, including a new focus on actual national security threats instead of politically driven prosecutions. She highlights efforts to reassign corrupt prosecutors to neutral roles, forcing some to resign rather than enforce immigration laws. Additionally, an internal inquiry has been launched into controversial charges used against January 6 defendants, particularly after a Supreme Court ruling reversed key legal precedents. The restructuring extends to federal attorneys, with new leadership prioritizing immigration enforcement. Kelly emphasizes that these moves mark a major step toward dismantling corruption within the DOJ and FBI, with more changes expected soon.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon discussed major economic and political shifts under a potential second Trump presidency. Patrick emphasized tariffs as a tool to balance trade deficits, suggesting a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, generating up to $820 billion annually. However, he acknowledged tariffs raise consumer prices and can trigger retaliatory measures, as seen in 2016, which impacted American farmers. Despite these drawbacks, tariffs have spurred U.S. manufacturing, with factory construction rising 250% since Trump’s initial tariffs on China. Patrick warned that tariffs alone wouldn’t close the deficit and that deficit spending remains a challenge.  Steve Bannon and Mike Davis discussed the critical need for conservative action in judicial confirmations and government spending. Davis emphasized mobilizing citizens to pressure senators into confirming President Trump’s cabinet picks, warning against GOP obstruction. Bannon reinforced that MAGA supporters will not tolerate resistance from Senate Republicans.  Natalie Winters gave her report from the White House.

Pettit’s institute aims to preserve Dr. Mackenzie’s legacy by researching his life and career, and they plan to open a museum dedicated to him.

Natalie Winters hosted the evening edition of WarRoom, and Steve Bannon hosted WarRoom Battleground. Natalie’s guests discussed FISA, a rally for President Trump in NYC on Monday.  Steve’s guests talked about transhumanism and a Judeo-Christian event. Highlights: US Rep Anna Pauline Luna talked about her procedural move on FISA with a Call to Action Gavin Wax talked about an upcoming rally for President Trump in NYC on Monday Mike Benz talked about the FISA debate Joe Allen of WarRoom talked about transhumanism Dr. Shawn Rowland Jase medical talked about the medical supply Rabbi Pesach talked about a Judeo-Christian event in Dallas Call to Action: Keep calling your Rep. about the FISA bill, see Rep. Anna Paulina Luna segment for more details Reccomended Reading: Drug shortages reach all-time high Full show in segments: A bill to extend FISA was passed in the House but hit a snag due to a procedural motion from Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida. This motion will require another vote to advance the bill to the Senate before a looming deadline. The bill involves reauthorization, likely related to surveillance and intelligence matters, and there seems to be contention over including a warrant amendment. Some Republicans, dubbed as “Traitors,” voted against the amendment, aligning with Democrats. Representative Luna is depicted as a staunch defender of civil liberties and constitutional rights. She pushes for the inclusion of the warrant amendment to protect against warrantless surveillance and urges constituents to contact their representatives to influence their votes on the matter. Additionally, Representative Luna has introduced legislation to increase penalties for child sex offenders, advocating for harsh sentences, including the death penalty or life imprisonment. She emphasizes the importance of such measures in protecting children and deterring offenders.   The discussion with Mike Benz revolves around the contentious issue of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and its implications for civil liberties, national security, and political power dynamics. There’s frustration over what’s perceived as a lack of action on the southern border and a focus on the FISA debacle instead. The conversation touches on how FISA can be weaponized against political opponents, particularly within the Republican Party, and how it intersects with broader issues of censorship, misinformation, and domestic surveillance. Benz expresses concerns about the erosion of constitutional rights, particularly regarding warrantless surveillance and the targeting of American citizens. There’s a sense of urgency in addressing these issues, especially in light of the upcoming 2024 election, where FISA and related issues could significantly shape the political narrative. The conversation reflects a deep-seated distrust of government institutions and a belief that civil liberties are threatened by unchecked government power.  The conversation with Gavin Wax highlights concerns about the erosion of constitutional freedoms, particularly regarding the recent FISA controversy. There’s criticism of Republican Party leadership for what’s perceived as a disconnect from the base and the country’s foundational principles. The focus then shifts to an upcoming rally organized by the New York Republican Club to protest what they see as a politically motivated prosecution of President Trump by the Manhattan District Attorney. The rally aims to demonstrate support for Trump and opposition to what they view as unjust treatment. Participants are encouraged to join the rally with signs, flags, and enthusiasm to make their voices heard. Investigative reporter Barbara Warren’s involvement is also mentioned, suggesting a coordinated effort to mobilize support for the rally.  Grassfed Beff from wwwMeriwetherFarms.com  The discussion revolves around a panel event in Dallas, Texas, featuring Laura Loomer, Frank Gaffney, and Lieutenant Colonel Allen West. The event aims to discuss Israel’s fight for Western civilization and the two-state delusion. The conversation highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of the conflict in Israel and how it is not just about Israel, but a battle against Judeo-Christian Western civilization. The panelists will also address Israel’s challenges, such as the Biden administration’s policies and the internal political landscape. The event will take place at the hexa Event Center in Richardson, Texas, on April 14. Doors will open at 4 p.m. Central Time. The panel discussion will start at 5 p.m., followed by a Q&A session. For those who cannot attend in person, the event will be live-streamed on Real America’s Voice starting at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Throughout the conversation, Rabbi Pesach expressed his concerns about the two-state solution and the lack of consensus within the Jewish community in Israel and the United States. He emphasize the importance of understanding the true intentions of Palestinian leadership and the need for the Jewish community to support Israel’s efforts to defend itself against terrorism and radical ideologies. To learn more about the event and to sign up for tickets, visit the Dallas Jewish Conservatives website at dallasjewishconservatives.com.  Bill White discussed events in Fulton County, Georgia, following a successful fundraising event for President Trump. Despite the positive outcome of the event, WHite said,  the next day, Chris Carr, a prosecuting attorney appointed by Governor Brian Kemp, announced an investigation into Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones for alleged election interference. While believes this investigation is politically motivated and implicates Kemp and his associates, suggesting they are complicit in prosecuting Trump. White indicates a conflict of interest involving Ronnie Willis, who has been disqualified from prosecuting Jones due to her ties to his opponent and he questions the timing and motivations behind the investigation, alleging that Kemp opposes Trump and seeks to remove potential political rivals like Jones from the picture.  The conversation revolves around the increasing number of drug shortages in the United States, which has reached a new high of 323 medications. The root causes discussed include the dependency on foreign countries like China for active pharmaceutical ingredients and generic medications, supply chain disruptions, and the increased demand for specific drugs due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on mental health. Dr. Shawn Rowland suggests securing the supply chain and bringing production back to the United States is crucial in addressing this issue. However, they also express concern that the problem will continue to worsen as the necessary actions to resolve it are not being taken.

Steve Bannon, Natalie Winters, Mike Lindell, and a panel of guests anchored the WarRoom for Thursday night WarRoom and WarRoom Battlefield live from the Ahern Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The focus of the discussion was election integrity, with many audience members participating with the hosts to ask questions about the different legal cases currently in the courts addressing the use of machine tabulators in the 2024 election. Important Action Steps: In a conversation with Russ Vought, Bannon asked him for recommendations on when the WarRoom Posse should call and contact their reps.  Vought told Bannon that the Possee members must say to their repos to  “absolutely vote against the rule.  They need to vote against the procedural changes. That we do not want to fund the war in Ukraine. Keep the focus on the main thing that we are opposed to, which is this third-party payment of an endless war, and it is the rule we oppose. You have to be specific and vote against the rule,” Vought said, adding: “And everyone’s doing a fantastic job of it. When we make these procedural issues cut through the national narrative, members respond with surprise and say; I can’t believe my voters are, are registering this much information on the procedural matters.   But that is what we want. That’s the granularity. That is the moment that you have the ability to let them know that we see precisely what you’re doing. We oppose it, and show them they won’t get away with it.” US Rep Chip Roy echoed these same steps for activists to use. Full show in segments: Bannon hosted a panel discussion that focused on potential issues with electronic voting machines, specifically those from Dominion, and their implications for election integrity. The discussion highlights allegations of altered software, false representation of certification and testing procedures, and the presence of encryption keys that could potentially allow unauthorized access to election data. Attorney Kurt Olsen mentions a legal case in Arizona in which new evidence has been presented, including system log files showing software alterations and the use of uncertified software. The discussion emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues to ensure the integrity of the election process.  Russ Vought discussed a legislative process involving considering a bill related to Ukraine funding and possibly other matters. It seems that there are different perspectives within a political party regarding the handling of the bill, with mention of individuals like Mike Johnson, Hakeem Jeffries, and various members of Congress. There’s discussion about procedural matters, including votes in committees and on the House floor, as well as the involvement of different political factions and the influence of public opinion. The dialogue also touches on broader themes such as U.S. involvement in international affairs, party dynamics, and the role of social media in political advocacy.  Congressman Roy criticized the legislative process and content of a bill related to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, arguing it does not prioritize securing the border and is a capitulation to Democrats. He mentioned the Freedom Caucus’s opposition and former President Trump’s involvement, urging people to contact their representatives and voice their opposition to the bill.  Don Ahern, the owner of Ahern hotel,  expressed gratitude for the attendees’ of the WarRoom event and voiced his support for President Trump. Ahern announces a significant upcoming event where Trump will speak at the hotel, highlighting the removal of a central feature of the hotel to make room for a stage for the Trump event. The event is described as a fundraiser, emphasizing the importance of financial support for Trump’s endeavors. Ahern reminisces about his ties to Nevada and encourages the state to embrace Republican values. Details about the fundraiser are provided, including a text messaging service for updates and the event date. The speaker concludes with enthusiasm for the event’s entertainment and thanks the fellowship of patriots for making America great again.   During a discussion about election integrity and cybersecurity, John Mills shares insights from his recent trip to Taiwan, where he learned about their election procedures. He emphasizes the importance of having insiders or collaborators in addition to technical capabilities for accessing data centers. Mills highlights Taiwan’s simplified election process, which involves paper ballots and minimal computer involvement until the county level. He clarifies that he’s not making accusations but presenting real-world findings and best practices. Mills directs listeners to access more information about his work, including his show, books, and platforms such as Substack, Getter, and Truth. He also offers a discount code for his store.  During an evening broadcast, a private in the Army shares a personal story about being discharged from the military for having a photo of President Trump on his phone. He reveals his journey from Peru to the United States and expresses gratitude to the Republican Party for providing legal assistance to regain his citizenship. Despite facing challenges, including accusations of racism, he remains determined to continue serving his adopted country. The private encourages others to follow him on social media for updates on his situation. The host expresses support and applause for the private’s resilience.  Live audience participation from the Ahern Hotel.  At the Ahern hotel, also called the ” Freedom Hotel”, the CEO of “Repair the Vote” discusses their efforts to pass a constitutional amendment in Nevada requiring voter ID. Despite facing legal challenges from prominent figures like Mark Elias, they continue to collect signatures. Seeking both financial support and volunteers, they emphasize the importance of voter ID, citing widespread bipartisan support. They encourage people to visit their website, www.repairthevote.us, to contribute and get involved, highlighting the potential impact on elections and urging unity in their cause.

Natalie Winters anchored the evening WarRoom program and spoke with guests on various topics pulled from current headlines. Steve Bannon hosted the evening WarRoom Battleground program. Highlights: US Rep. Tim Burchett spoke about the government process in DC, calling it a sewer, not a swamp. Bradley Devlin talked about his newest article at American Conservative and what is unfolding with Speaker Mike Johnson. Russ Vought talked about the problems with the Uni-party and the process of voting on the Hill for current bills. Laura Loomer gave details from her week-long reporting at the NYC courthouse, including live reporting about the man who lit himself on fire.  Loomer proved that he was not a supporter of Trump’s. US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked about her actions to displace Speaker Mike Johnson and the very bold emergence of the UniParty, which refused to address the concerns of the America First agenda. Reccomended Reading: Democrats Save Johnson’s Military Spending— But Will They Save His Speakership? Full show in segments: Tim Burhett provided an update on the current situation regarding the fiscal packages, expressing concern about the escalating national debt. He criticized allocating additional funds to Ukraine, highlighting the failure of repayment promises. He lamented the lack of accountability among politicians and emphasized the importance of scrutinizing voting records. The congressman expressed frustration with fellow conservatives who make deals with Democrats and then espouse opposing views publicly. He accused the political establishment of creating distractions, such as the focus on Ukraine’s importance for democracy. He argued against further debt accumulation and warned of the consequences of losing control over government branches.  The discussion revolved around Bradley Delvin’s assertion that Speaker Johnson’s replacement could potentially do more harm than Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries. The conversation touched on the power dynamics within the House of Representatives and the implications of siding with Democrats. The focus shifted towards the upcoming votes and the possibility of a motion to vacate Speaker Johnson. Speculation arose about the outcome and its impact on Republican unity and governing capabilities leading up to the November election. Additionally, there was mention of strategic considerations from Mar-A-Lago insiders regarding the handling of the situation.  The conversation delved into the aftermath of recent events, particularly the Brexit moment and the morning show’s discussion about Republicans’ involvement in driving certain decisions. Bannon and Vought  had criticism directed towards members of Congress for potentially supporting actions akin to previous lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, driven by defense contractors. The discussion highlighted a perceived lack of awareness or engagement with alternative sources of information among certain politicians. Specific attention was paid to Speaker Johnson’s handling of various issues and his alignment with lobbying interests. The impending votes and the possibility of a motion to vacate Speaker Johnson were analyzed, with speculation about the potential fallout and its implications for Republican unity and governance. The role of grassroots activism and the need for informed engagement were emphasized, along with concerns about leadership’s response to increasing scrutiny and awareness among activists. Additionally, there was discussion about the arguments put forth by certain members regarding the necessity of specific actions and their alignment with the America First movement and former President Trump’s agenda.  Laura Loomer provided insight into the incident outside the courthouse, dispelling misconceptions propagated by the media. She described how an individual, later identified as Max Azarella, lit himself on fire in the Trump section, despite being a Bernie Sanders and Obama supporter. Loomer highlighted the media’s attempt to portray the incident as Trump-induced chaos despite evidence to the contrary. She revealed that NYPD confiscated a sign explicitly anti-Trump but left pamphlets containing Azarella’s manifesto. Loomer emphasized Azarella’s political orientation and provided details from his social media activity, including posts about rubbing alcohol and lawsuits against the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. She concluded by sharing her exclusive video footage and directing viewers to her platforms for further updates.  Colonel John Mills discussed the ongoing Chinese cyber attack, referred to as “Vault Typhoon,” which was first publicly reported in May of the previous year. He highlighted key events leading up to the attack, such as the signing of the fiscal year 23 National Defense Authorization Act, which provided support to Taiwan. Additionally, he mentioned a tabletop exercise called for in the act to test the resilience of domestic critical infrastructure in the event of war with China over Taiwan. Mills emphasized the seriousness of the situation, noting animated Congressional testimony from NSA Director Jen Easterly and Cyber Command Director. He criticized the allocation of resources, suggesting that efforts to address other issues, such as investigating January 6th incidents, diverted attention from the Chinese cyber threat. Mills warned of the preparation for war and the placement of malware on domestic critical infrastructure by China, urging the audience to take the threat seriously.  The discussion revolved around the potential consequences of challenging Speaker Johnson’s leadership and the arguments for and against such action. The speaker’s perceived failures and the risk of turning over control to Hakeem Jeffries were debated. Representative Johnson’s handling of legislative processes, particularly regarding a veteran healthcare bill, was scrutinized. The conversation highlighted concerns about the Republican Party’s ability to maintain voter trust and achieve its goals. Representative Johnson’s perceived alignment with Democrats and his approach to negotiations were criticized. The urgency of addressing pressing issues such as national debt and border security was emphasized. Despite concerns about risking Republican control of the House, there was support for challenging Speaker Johnson’s leadership. The discussion concluded with a call to action for concerned individuals to gather more information about the situation.  The Free Press Citizen at FreePress.com discussed Turning Point’s efforts to secure swing states like Michigan through their “Chase the Vote” initiative. Charlie Kirk spearheaded this initiative, aiming to raise $100 million for turnout efforts in key counties across seven swing states. The program has already been launched in Arizona and Wisconsin, with Scott Pressler leading the efforts in Wisconsin. Today, Turning Point Action announced its expansion into Michigan. While discussing polling data, it was noted that Trump has a chance in these states despite national polls suggesting otherwise. The website, known for its fast loading speed and absence of ads, provides comprehensive analysis and updates on election-related news.  Bannon and Vought talked about the frustration among many, which is palpable when they witness their own team engaging in actions like what happened with the Jacob Veterans bill, where it was stripped and replaced with unrelated items. This tactic, Vought said, undermines trust and leaves people feeling betrayed, especially when it involves prominent figures like Mike Johnson, who is considered a leader in Christian and social movements. According to Bannon, the recent moves regarding the dollarization process, seizing Russian assets, and destabilizing the financial system have only added to the dismay. Such actions are seen as not only damaging but also as potential acts of war and could have severe consequences for the country. The perceived alignment with the Democratic party on specific issues further erodes confidence in those who claim to champion America First principles.  Mike Lindell talked about specials in merch for the WarRoom audience.  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as Steve Bannon reminds us.

Steve Bannon hosted the Evening WarRoom program and Natalie Winters hosted the evening WarRoom Battleground. Cold Opens for the evening WarRoom program was footage from corporate media with talking heads deconstructing the Trial against Donald Trump and introducing Steve Bannon’s name into the conversation. Ben Bergquam, who was present in the courtroom then, reported during his segment that when Bannon’s name was introduced, it caused such a stir that the court had to be in recess for some time. Winters played cold opens that showed Joe Biden talking about a climate crisis. Highlights: Steve Bannon continued to expose Speaker Mike Johnson for not protecting President Trump, pushing for a criminal conspiracy. Ben Bergquam talked about what he had seen in the streets of New York, at NYU, where a wall has been constructed to control rioting, and highlights from Trump’s trial. Garret Ziegler reported on an update about the lawsuit Hunter Biden has brought against Marco Polo over publishing contents of Hunter’s abandoned laptop. Julie Kelly reported on the unconstitutional nature of the lawfare being used on President Trump and talked about a new report she has published on classified documents. Mike Lindell talked about deals for the WarRoom audience. Dave Walsh reported on the left’s use of Earth Dave to drive up the cost of living for Americans for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party. Col. John Mills discussed warfare tactics and the upcoming ‘Summer of Love’ riots ahead of the 2024 election. Dr. Naomi Wolf spoke about fertility and COVID. Bradley Devlin Editor of American Conservative, reported on the process for the Foreign Aid spending bill. Jim Hoft talked about a recent report on election integrity. Reccomended reading: Julie Kelly Tweet about Judge Cannon likely shows criminal conspiracy Complete show in Segments: Bergquam reported two New York universities where protests are unfolding: NYU Protests: Over 120 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested at NYU for defying a university order to leave.
A plywood wall was erected around NYU’s Gould Plaza in response to the protests. Bergquam said that most of those arrested were released on trespassing summonses, while a few received desk appearance tickets for charges like resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration. Columbia University: Bergquam said that President Menouche Shafik faces calls to resign due to ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at the Ivy League school’s Morningside Heights campus.   He said he spoke with students who opposed Israeli military action in Gaza and demanded divestment from companies they claim "profit from Israeli apartheid.”
An encampment was set up on Columbia’s South Lawn, coinciding with the college president’s testimony on campus antisemitism after the Hamas attack on Israel. Bergquam reported that these protests involve elements of Antifa, Black Bloc, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While primarily driven by the Sharia supremacist movement, there are broader dynamics at play in these demonstrations. The situation remains tense, and the goal is to insulate campuses while addressing the underlying issues.  Garrett Ziegler reported that he is heading to Nashville to give a talk on the controversial laptop issue. The talk will take place at the Hyatt House in Franklin, starting at 6:30 PM Central Daylight Time. Ziegler emphasized the importance of this laptop issue, highlighting the lack of mainstream support for his cause and the legal challenges he’s facing. He discussed the lawsuit against him regarding the laptop data and invited attendees to learn more about the topic. Ziegler stresses his commitment to the truth and encourages people to hear his perspective firsthand at the event.  Steve Bannon criticized several figures, including Jim Jordan and Mike “Polly Pockets” Johnson, accusing them of enabling a conspiracy to undermine the country. He argues that House Republicans are complicit in efforts to harm Trump and prioritize political gain over justice. Bannon called for action to expose and combat these alleged injustices, expressing frustration with the lack of action and demanding that Republicans defend Trump and his mission vigorously.  Crom Carmichael emphasizes the importance of maintaining heart health and managing cholesterol levels. He shares a testimonial from a satisfied customer who experienced a significant drop in cholesterol levels after using their product. Hearts encourages listeners to visit warroomhealth.com and use the code “warroom” at checkout to access a special offer on their subscription program. He highlights the effectiveness of their product and expresses gratitude for the opportunity to share it with the audience.  Julie Kelly reveals bombshell revelations on a classified documents case involving Trump. The scheme aims to drain Trump’s energy and resources to hinder his campaign efforts against Biden. Bannon says that it is a criminal conspiracy orchestrated by the Biden administration, DOJ, and intel community to entrap Trump. Despite Kelly’s viral tweets and detailed coverage, Republican leadership remains silent, focusing on trivial matters instead of addressing this significant issue.  Mike Lindell discusses a product called the roll-and-go travel pillow that features the American flag and a five-point star, which resonates with the audience’s patriotism. He emphasizes that customers who use the promo code “war room” on the website to make any purchase today will receive one of these pillows for free. He also mentions other specials available on the site, including discounted sandals and bathrobes. He thanks the audience for their support, noting that their purchases have helped the company’s factory reach full capacity again. Lindell ends by reminding listeners to stay safe during travel and promises to continue discussing the ongoing criminal conspiracy on the show tomorrow.  Bradley Devlin from The American Conservative joins the show to discuss Speaker Mike Johnson’s and Senate counterpart Mitch McConnell’s failures. He highlights how McConnell’s focus on Ukraine and Israel’s aid over securing the southern border reflects the establishment’s priorities, which diverge from those of Republican voters. Devlin expresses hope for a conservative reversion in the future but acknowledges the challenges faced by figures like Johnson who are influenced by intelligence agencies and proximity to power. The conversation delves into the disconnect between the establishment’s priorities and the concerns of conservative voters, emphasizing the need for alignment within the Republican Party.  Jim Hoft from The Gateway Pundit joins the discussion to shed light on what he believes is a critical issue for the 2024 election: fraudulent voter registrations. Hoft emphasizes the importance of cleaning up voter rolls to prevent Democrats from gaining an unfair advantage through inflated voter numbers. He highlights a report from True the Vote, which revealed 1.7 million suspicious voter registrations in Texas, indicating potential voter fraud. Hoft suggests that Democrats rely on these fraudulent registrations to secure additional votes, especially in battleground states. He cites examples from Michigan, where thousands of fraudulent registrations were tied to leftist organizations. Hoff expresses concern that Democrats are orchestrating a strategy to manipulate voter registrations to their advantage, potentially impacting the outcome of the election. He urges vigilance and calls for action to crack down on fake voter registrations to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process.  Dave Walsh discusses recent legislative moves by the Biden administration that seem to prioritize environmental policies over American energy security. He criticizes initiatives like endorsing Deb Haaland’s plan to restrict oil and gas drilling in Alaska, which he sees as detrimental to American interests. Walsh highlights the administration’s focus on incentivizing rooftop solar installations over utility-scale solar projects, which he believes is a misuse of funds. He suggests that these policies will increase the cost of living for average citizens and ultimately benefit China, which has gained a dominant market share in electrical equipment supply for power generation. Walsh implies that there may be financial motives behind these policies and suggests a connection between academic research funding and the promotion of climate change ideology.  Dr. Naomi Wolf discusses new data regarding fertility and reproductive issues potentially linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. The data, obtained from the Ontario health insurance plan billing code data via freedom of information requests, indicates a significant increase in fertility problems, menstrual disorders, miscarriages, and male infertility following widespread COVID-19 vaccination in Canada. This large-scale analysis, conducted by the Canadian COVID Care Alliance and presented by Amy Kelly of Daily Cloud, reveals alarming trends in female and male reproductive health post-vaccination. The findings underscore the urgent need for further investigation and raise concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility. The full analysis is available on dailycloud.io, where readers can also support the War Room Daily Cloud’s efforts in bringing attention to critical issues like these.  Colonel John Mills discusses the tactics of China’s fifth-generation warfare, focusing on its efforts to disrupt the elections in Taiwan. He highlights the role of social media platforms like TikTok in spreading misinformation and manipulation, citing examples of influencers spreading false narratives to create mistrust and division. Mills also emphasizes the importance of on-the-ground collaborators in executing these operations effectively. Additionally, he discusses the situation in Niger, criticizing the State Department’s prioritization of certain issues like transgenderism over national security concerns. He argues that the failures in Niger are indicative of broader issues within the State Department and questions the expertise of its diplomatic core.

There are no cold openings for today. Host Steve Bannon jumped right into the news.  Julie Kelly opened the WarRoom action by discussing a US Supreme Court case she would follow and tweet live about it. Bannon moved into interviews from the SCOTUS building and then lived in NYC. “Trump resonates with the working class, he says what we want to hear,” the leader of local 638 told David Zere Thursday morning in NYC. “They were cheering for Trump at the top of their lungs, and it was not staged,” Zere told Bannon. Highlights: Steve Bannon continued to slam the Republican leadership, focusing on Speaker Mike Johnson, saying GOP leadership in DC does not want President Trump to win. Julie Kelly spoke about her coverage of the US SCOTUS case. Mike Davis reported live from the US Supreme Court case dealing with presidential immunity. David Zere was seen reporting live at a rally by NYC construction workers for President Trump from 6 AM Thursday morning before Trump’s court appearances. Zere talked about bringing manufacturing back to the United States. Abe Hamadeh talked about his race for AG in AZ, and details about Trump EJ Antonni talked about the financial situation with new economic reports. Raheem Kassam talked about his new piece in National Pulse about Speaker Mike Johnson. Ben Bergquam reported live from the courthouse in New York City on the ‘hush money’ trial gave details about gag order violations and talked about AZ indictments that were made public Wednesday. Jack Ryan author Steve Stern talked about the Precinct project and a 3:00 call to action Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock Reccomended reading: Statement by Abe Hamadeh about AZ AG KASSAM: What the F–k is Mike Johnson Doing? Reccomended watching: Precinct project call Full show in segments: Julie Kelly will be live tweeting about the historic oral arguments regarding presidential immunity in the case Donald J. Trump versus the U. The case relates to indictments stemming from the events of January 6th and the 2020 election. Lower courts have ruled that presidents are not protected by immunity. Julie’s Twitter handle is @Julie_Kelly2 for real-time commentary. The proceedings are available on C-SPAN and the Supreme Court website. The discussion also briefly touches on Jack Smith’s involvement in a Florida situation, but details are limited.  Abe Hamadeh discusses ongoing legal battles in Arizona, where the AG just handed out felony charges to supporters of President Trump. He highlights his own experience as the legitimate Attorney General candidate, who lost by a mere 208 votes. He points out discrepancies in ballot counts, with what he says are 9,000 outstanding ballots, and alleges a broader criminal conspiracy targeting MAGA candidates and supporters. Hamadeh criticizes the legal system’s handling of cases and expresses frustration with Republican inaction. He emphasizes the importance of fighting for the America First movement and urges support for President Trump. Hamadeh’s website is abeforaz.com for more information.  EJ Antoni discusses the economic landscape, pointing out the discrepancy between GDP growth and increasing debt. He highlights the government’s reliance on deficit spending to boost economic numbers, artificially leading to structural stagflation. He emphasizes the importance of understanding these economic realities and advocates for a change in approach from Washington, DC.  David Zere reported live from New York City on President Trump’s surprise visit to New York, which received praise from construction workers’ unions, showcasing his support among the working class. The event was organized by Gavin Wax and the New York Young Republicans Club. Zere reported that workers expressed frustration with the current administration’s policies and showed enthusiasm for Trump’s promises to bring back manufacturing and protect industries like steel. Despite the organic support, the event contrasted with the ongoing political persecution against Trump. The absence of certain Republican leaders, such as  Speaker Mike Johnson, highlights a divide within the party regarding Trump’s role and the direction of the GOP.   Raheem Kassam and Steve Bannon discuss Mike Johnson’s actions regarding the speaker of the house and their disappointment in his lack of action on key issues. Kassam highlights the importance of focusing on critical issues such as immigration and illegal migration instead of diverting attention to less significant matters, which is what Speaker Johnson is seen as doing. Kassam emphasizes the need for Republican leadership to stop interfering and instead focus on important issues facing the country. He encourages listeners to visit The National Pulse website for more analysis and updates, including one article that caught Bannon’s eye and is on the recommended reading list. KASSAM: What the F–k is Mike Johnson Doing?  Mike Davis reports from outside the Supreme Court on a historic case regarding whether the president of the United States is immune from criminal prosecution for his official acts. He highlights the case’s potential implications and argues that granting immunity to presidents is essential to preserve the integrity of the presidency and the country. T he government’s central argument against immunity is based on the absence of explicit provisions in the Constitution or statutes. However, Davis emphasizes the importance of maintaining separation of powers and warns against the consequences of allowing a president to indict his predecessor for official acts. Later, he discusses the lack of action by the House on criminal conspiracy issues, especially in light of recent events in Arizona. Despite facing protests, Davis underscores the importance of upholding First Amendment rights while reporting on such cases.  Ben Bergquam reported live from New York City that President Trump has been in court, facing efforts to impose violations of a gag order on him. The prosecution is irritated by Trump’s disregard for their rules, particularly regarding mentions of David Pecker, which they see as a breach. However, the charges are viewed by some as a distraction from the real issues the prosecution wants, such as election fraud, which comes at the same time AZ Attorney General is making a big splash and bringing indictments against Trump’s supporters. in Arizona, there are concerns about a conspiracy involving 17 indictments, which some attribute to leftist tactics to manipulate the justice system rather than winning through conventional means. These actions highlight the ongoing battle over the integrity of elections and the role of the courts in deciding political outcomes and adds more suspicion of the need for a criminal conspiracy inquiry from the Republican led US House of Reps..  Steve Stern reported some successes with the Precinct Project. He added that Today at 3:30, there’s a crucial call happening, and Bannon emphasizes its importance, urging people not to “lean on their shovels but to join in”. The call will feature prominent figures like Christina Bob, Greg Stenson, Dr. Naomi Wolf, among others. Stern said they will discuss various topics, including removing illegal voters from state voting rolls and the differences between the timing in voting. Stern provides multiple ways to access the call, emphasizing action and participation.  Natalie Demente discusses the rising ease with which criminals can commit property fraud, highlighting the vulnerabilities in the system. County clerks often cannot detect fraud when processing property transfer documents, leading to potentially fraudulent transactions being accepted. Even if fraud is suspected, clerks are legally obligated to accept the documents. Resolving the issue often requires costly litigation if a fraudulent document is filed for someone’s property. Natalie emphasizes the importance of Home Title Lock in providing comprehensive protection against property fraud. Home Title Lock monitors property changes and intervenes to rectify fraud, giving homeowners peace of mind. She encourages listeners to visit hometitlelock.com and use the promo code “war room” to receive the first 30 days of protection for free, along with a complementary title scan to ensure their property’s security.  Jack Ryan discusses the concept of home ownership from an economic perspective, arguing against the traditional notion of it being a fundamental aspect of the American dream. He challenges the idea that owning a home is always the best financial decision, emphasizing the costs and limitations associated with homeownership, including transaction fees, maintenance expenses, and the lack of mobility it imposes. Ryan suggests that the push for homeownership is perpetuated by real estate cartels and politicians to control individuals’ behavior and tax them more easily. He advocates for a more objective analysis of the financial implications of homeownership.

Steve Bannon hosted the Wednesday morning WarRoom program. Today is a day of action, and the audience needs to note Charlie Kirk’s remarks below for instructions. The goal is to call and encourage Nebraska to change its state laws. Keep reading for instructions. Highlights: The Wednesday morning WarRoom program, hosted by Steve Bannon, highlighted various political, legal, and grassroots efforts to support former President Trump and criticize opponents within both the Republican Party and Democratic parites. Charlie Kirk urged Republicans to repeal Nebraska’s 1991 law, which assigns two electors to the state’s winner and one for each congressional district. The goal is to shift Nebraska to a winner-take-all system, potentially benefiting Trump’s chances in future elections. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen and Trump endorsed this initiative. Doug Mackey‘s case, where he was arrested for posting memes on Twitter and charged with conspiracy against civil rights, was discussed, raising concerns about freedom of speech. Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock discussed the growing problem of squatting and title theft, emphasizing the importance of homeowners safeguarding their properties and equity. Darren Beattie criticized the Biden DOJ’s attempt to suppress speech deemed as “disinformation” and discussed Mackey’s case as emblematic of broader trends targeting Trump supporters. Mike Lindell expressed gratitude for support in Wisconsin and promoted his product line, including special deals on pillows and other items. Dave Brat and Bannon discussed Jim Wallace’s gospel interpretation, highlighting skepticism about his approach and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing biblical teachings in education. Overall, the program aimed to raise awareness and encourage action on various political and legal issues while promoting unity among supporters. Each segment below provides insights into various issues and encourages audience engagement and awareness. Recommended Reading: Gospel of Mark (Bannon reads King James version) Darren Beattie’s letter to Elon Musk about Clinton crushing Meme case Recommended Watching: Elmer Gentry- the movie Bannon uses at the end of the cold open Crucial implements all Posse members need to have: Tool for Charlie Kirk’s Call for Action- BillBlaster Day of Action details:  Donald Trump and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen have endorsed legislation that aims to change the allocation of electoral votes in Nebraska, potentially removing Omaha’s pivotal electoral vote from consideration for Democrats. Conservative activist Charlie Kirk urged Republicans to repeal the state’s 1991 law, which assigns two electors to the state’s winner and one for each congressional district. Despite Republicans consistently winning Nebraska, the Omaha-based 2nd District voted Democratic in 2008 and 2020. Kirk called on Nebraskans to demand their state stop giving strength to their political opponents. Five hours after Kirk’s post on Tuesday, Pillen expressed support for a bill shifting Nebraska to a winner-take-all system. Trump also endorsed Pillen’s move, acknowledging the district’s significance in potentially deciding close races between Trump and President Biden. The attention on Omaha’s district underscores its potential role as a tiebreaker in presidential elections. Full show in segments: Steve Bannon opened the Wed WarRoom with clips from MSNBC showing the talking heads being highly emotional and highly charged about President Donald Trump’s surging popularity with key demographics Democrats rely on to win the presidency in 2024. Bannon highlighted the intense media coverage surrounding the upcoming election, particularly on MSNBC. The coverage focused on Trump’s actions at political rallies, and Bannon mentioned polling data indicating Trump’s strength in battleground states. He then critiques the Biden administration’s handling of various issues, including economics and immigration. Bannon deconstructed the strategy by Trump’s opponents to portray him negatively as an authoritarian figure while positioning themselves as defenders of true Christianity. This segment portrays a highly charged political atmosphere with strong rhetoric and strategic maneuvering that Bannon is known best for delivering to the WarRoom audience.  Bannon reflected on the Democrat’s political strategy and messaging in the context of the 2024 election. He emphasized the importance of knowing who to persuade and who to defeat in campaigns, mainly focusing on issues like abortion and the right-to-life movement. In this segment, he discusses the tactics of Trump’s opponents, including the Democrat’s attempts to portray him negatively, using stale political messaging, that he is an authoritarian figure, and working to divide voters along racial lines. Bannon said that he supports  Trump’s team countering these narratives and promoting Christian values with a turn of the phrase for “Transgender Day of Visibility,” like Trump did calling for a Christian Day of Visibility on election day at a recent campaign event. Bannon went into great detail, highlighting the significance of the Gospel of Mark in the Holy Bible, and contrasted that with the Democrat’s idea of Biblical teachings. Bannon critiqued specific interpretations of Christianity, which were discussed on MSNBC, in order to marginalize supporters of Trump, who MSNBC speakers say push a false “white gospel” that they want to be replaced with what Bannon calls a social justice warrior ideology. Bannon discussed his interpretation of Christianity and explained how that relates to his political views.  The conversation highlights the case of Doug Mackey, who was arrested for posting memes on Twitter and charged with conspiracy against civil rights. The case is foundational and historic. Mackey was charged to 7 months and $50,000 dollar fine. There is an appeal hearing on Friday. Bannon jumped into the legal implications of Mackey’s case, highlighting concerns about freedom of speech and the potential misuse of legal statutes to suppress political dissent. Bannon expressed skepticism about the charges against Mackey and criticized what he perceived as an overreach by law enforcement and the judicial system. Bannon argued that Mackey’s case for posting memes in 2016 is part of a broader trend of targeting supporters of President Trump who express views contrary to those of the ruling elites, particularly within the Biden administration and ahead of the 2024 election is chilling. The conversation underscores the importance of defending free speech rights and resisting efforts to criminalize political speech. Mackey directed people to MemeDefense.com to learn more about his situation.  Natalie Dominguez, a theft specialist at Home Title Lock, discussed the growing problem of squatting and title theft, particularly in light of recent viral videos encouraging illegal immigrants to occupy unoccupied homes. Squatting involves gaining access to a property without the owner’s permission and exploiting legal loopholes to remain there. It can lead to adverse possession laws granting squatters legal ownership over time. According to Dominquez, squatters increasingly resort to fraudulent documentation and lease agreements to prolong their stay and complicate eviction procedures for homeowners. On the other hand, title theft involves fraudulently transferring ownership of a property and exploiting its equity through lines of credit or unauthorized sales. Dominguez told Bannon that Home Title Lock offers triple lock protection against title theft, including 24/7 monitoring, title change alerts, and expert assistance. She emphasized the importance of homeowners being vigilant and taking proactive measures to safeguard their properties and equity. She encouraged homeowners to visit hometitlelock.com and use the promo code “war room” to receive 30 days of free protection and a free title scan.  Darren Beattie, editor of Revolver News, appeared on the WarRoom to talk to Steve Bannon about the growing fear and frustration over the lawfare of Trump supporters for posting memes and engaging in political speech. Beattie criticized the Biden Department of Justice (DOJ) for attempting to codify the suppression of speech they deem as “disinformation” into the legal framework. Beattie argues that this is a form of lawfare where the legal system is weaponized to silence political opponents. Bannon and Beattie highlight the case of Doug Mackey, who was arrested and convicted for posting memes on Twitter, as emblematic of this broader trend. Beattie told Bannon that he sees Mackey’s case as a test balloon for whether the government can imprison individuals for expressing opinions contrary to those in power. Beattie also criticized the collaboration of social media platforms like Twitter in Mackey’s prosecution, suggesting that they provided information to authorities that led to his arrest, which is the foundation for his article and letter to Elon Musk to remedy his part of the problem. Beattie calls for support for Mackey’s case and urges people to visit revolver.news for more information and to share the case details.  Charlie Kirk discussed a grassroots effort in Nebraska to change the allocation of electoral votes. The effort aims to move away from what they have- and to become a winner-takes-all system instead of one that distributes electoral votes based on congressional districts. This change could potentially give Donald Trump a better chance of winning the presidency. Kirk emphasized the importance of this effort and encouraged people to contact Senator Rita Sanders and Senator Raymond Aguilar, two specific state senators, to express support for the bill. He highlights Governor Pete Ricketts’ endorsement of the bill and President Trump’s backing of the initiative. Kirk stresses the need for respectful communication with the senators and urges individuals, particularly those from Nebraska, to advocate for the bill’s passage. He plans to visit Nebraska to support the initiative in person. Kirk sees this effort as crucial for potentially changing the electoral map and increasing Trump’s chances of winning the presidency in future elections. See notes above for more information:   Mike Lindell expressed gratitude to the War Room Posse, attributing their efforts to the success in Wisconsin this week. He then discussed his product line, including the rolling pillows available at a special price of two for $25. Lindell highlighted various designs that were available and encouraged listeners to visit the website to make a purchase. Additionally, Lindell mentioned discounts on other products, such as sandals, slides, premium pillows, and a four-pack dish towel set, all available for $25 each. Lindell concluded by expressing love for the War Room Posse and encouraging them to call in with their support.  The conversation between Dave Brat and Steve Bannon touched on Jim Wallace’s interpretation of the gospel from his new book, which some see as centered around social justice Jesus rather than the traditional teachings found in the Bible. Brat expressed skepticism about Wallace’s approach, noting that the Bible does not support a “white gospel” narrative and highlighted figures like Saint Augustine, who was not white but contributed significantly to Christian theology. The discussion also touches on the separation of church and state, referencing recent events like Joe Biden’s acknowledgment of Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter. Despite ideological differences, as Brat noted, the Democrats on MSNBC now shared belief in God’s sovereignty and the importance of traditional family values across Abrahamic faiths—which he argued should lead to a discussion of when Bibles go back into the American classrooms. Overall, Brat emphasized the need to prioritize Biblical teachings, reintroduce them into education, and focus on foundational principles like the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman. The conversation ends with a sense of optimism about the potential for unity and positive change- wich may or may not have been laced with a touch of witty, Brat, sarcasm. Listen, and you decide.

Natalie Winters hosted the evening WarRoom program, and Steve Bannon hosted the Wednesday evening WarRoom Battleground program. Highlights: Each segment covers different aspects of political, legal, and grassroots efforts related to various issues, including immigration, free speech, energy policy, and election funding. Full show in segments: The conversation between WarRoom host Natalie Winters and Monica Crowley mainly focused on President Trump’s recent remarks, particularly on illegal immigration and the border situation. Crowley emphasized the gravity of the issue, stating that it has become the number one concern across all demographic groups in the country. Crowley highlighted the contrast between Trump’s approach to border control and the current situation under President Biden, suggesting that this issue alone could significantly influence the upcoming election. Winters and Crowley discussed potential strategies that Democrats might employ to counteract the negative perception of their handling of immigration, such as deflecting attention to other issues like abortion or attempting to make the election a referendum on Trump. However, Crowley expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of these tactics, arguing that the widespread impact of the border crisis is driving a political realignment among traditionally Democratic constituencies. Additionally, Crowley discussed her podcast, where listeners can find her analysis on various platforms, including Apple, Google, Spotify, and Stitcher, and her social media channels, where she shares her written pieces and updates on her work.  Todd Bensman discussed the intricacies of the NGO’s involvement in the situation at the southern border, emphasizing the gravity of the issue. He described the massive influx of migrants, noting that the numbers were enough to replace the entire population of several states. Bensman reported from Mexico, detailing the crackdown on migration flows by the Mexican government, which he attributed to a secret diplomatic deal likely aimed at influencing the 2024 election. He contrasted President Trump’s and President Biden’s approaches to Mexico, highlighting Trump’s use of aggressive trade tariffs to pressure Mexico into cooperation on border issues. In contrast, Biden’s administration promised financial aid to address the root causes of migration, which Bensman criticized as ineffective. He suggested that the Biden administration’s approach lacked leverage and could potentially involve corrupt dealings. He also discussed Texas’s efforts to reinforce its border infrastructure in response to the influx of migrants, highlighting extensive fortifications along the riverbank, mentioning witnessing migrants attempting to breach the barriers and emphasizing the seriousness of Texas’s preparations for potential future challenges. To access Todd’s footage and further information on the border situation, he directed people to his social media profiles, particularly on X and Getter, where he regularly shares updates and content related to the border.  Steve Bannon opened the segment by referencing the movie Braveheart and comparing Scotland’s historic resilience and intellectual contributions to the modern world. The discussion then shifted to a serious topic regarding hate speech laws in Scotland. Peter Mcilvenna appeared with Bannon and explained that the Scottish Parliament had passed the new Scottish Hate Crime and Public Order Bill, criminalizing speech that stirs up hatred based on various characteristics. The bill was pushed through by the Scottish National Party and received significant support from other parties. The legislation has raised concerns among free speech advocates, comedians, and sports stars, as it imposes strict penalties, including potential imprisonment for offenders. The law encompasses a broad range of protected characteristics, such as race, disability, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Mcilvenna highlighted the case of J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, who has been vocal against certain aspects of the transgender rights movement. Rowling has faced backlash from fellow celebrities and activists but remains steadfast in her beliefs about biological sex and gender. The discussion emphasized the importance of defending free speech under increasingly restrictive legislation. Overall, the conversation underscored the significance of these developments in Scotland and the potential implications for free speech rights in other jurisdictions, including the United States.  Dave Walsh appeared on the WarRoom and criticized the Biden administration’s decision to draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), saying it was a political move aimed at influencing gasoline prices ahead of the upcoming election. Walsh said the administration has not followed through on previous commitments to replenish the SPR when oil prices fell below a certain threshold. He then added that he believes this manipulation of the SPR is ineffective in significantly impacting gasoline prices and is purely politically motivated. Walsh argued that the Department of Energy, responsible for managing the SPR, ultimately reports to the president, making it a decision within his purview.  Mike Howell discussed the significance of Wisconsin becoming the 20th state to ban private funding of election systems, often called the “Zucker Bucks” model. This model, seen in the last presidential election cycle, involved billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg providing funds to staff up and support local election offices in key demographic counties. Howell highlights the new iteration of this model, dubbed “Biden Bucks,” which involves federal government agencies working in collaboration with left-leaning NGOs to mobilize voters. Despite some members of Congress raising concerns, the House of Representatives ultimately funded this initiative, leading to criticism from Howell. Additionally, he mentioned an upcoming symposium addressing various policy areas and featuring notable figures such as FBI whistleblowers, Senator Grassley, and others. #WeapoSympo  In this segment, Mike Lindell discussed two main topics: a Supreme Court case update and news about a recall effort in Wisconsin involving Robin Vos. Regarding the Supreme Court case, Lindell mentioned that lawyers filed additional documents due to the defendants not responding, mainly focusing on issues related to election software manipulation in Arizona. The speaker encourages listeners to visit LindellPlan.com for details. Lindell also highlighted a recall effort against Robin Vos in Wisconsin, urging listeners to check out the new petition at SeenRecall.org. Additionally, Lindell promoted My Pillow’s spring sale, offering various discounts on pillows, towels, sheets, and other products using the promo code “warroom” and mentioning exclusive deals for the War Room Posse.

Natalie Winters hosted the Friday evening WarRoom show and Steve Bannon hosted the Friday evening WarRoom Battleground program. Highlights:  Full show in segments: Natalie Winters and Kash Patel discussed various topics, including the Biden administration’s regulatory actions and the Pentagon’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Patel, known for his work with the Trump administration, highlighted the hypocrisy in the government’s treatment of regulations and accountability. The conversation also touched on the media’s role in covering up mistakes and the disappointment expressed towards figures like The Rock for their silence on political matters. Patel emphasized the importance of transparency and urged readers to get his book, “Government Gangsters,” which he claims is a roadmap for challenging the Deep State. He also announced an upcoming film adaptation of the book that will be out in May 2024. The discussion concluded with a call to action for readers to spread awareness and educate others about combating government corruption.  This segment of War Room featured Kristan Hawkins discussing recent developments in Florida regarding abortion legislation. Hawkins told Winters that the Florida Supreme Court upheld a late-term abortion limit, preventing abortions after 15 weeks, which is expected to save thousands of lives. However, the court also allowed a late-term abortion ballot referendum to proceed to voters in November despite Governor Santos predicting its failure. Hawkins provided context on Students for Life America’s activism, including protests against Vice President Harris’s abortion policies. Hawkins shared a disturbing incident where protesters threatened and verbally attacked Students for Life members, highlighting the abuse faced by pro-life advocates. The segment concluded with a preview of a video showing the confrontation and a discussion on the extremism of the Democratic Party regarding abortion.  The following discussion on War Room featured Todd Bensman reporting from Mexico on the ongoing border crisis. Bensman highlighted the chaos and contradictions at the border, where immigrants cut through razor wire infrastructure erected by Texas authorities while border patrol stands ready to welcome them into the country. He described scenes of lawlessness and the futility of attempts to secure the border. Bensman also mentioned the Mexican authorities’ efforts to mitigate the crisis’s optics. Meanwhile, on the other side, the La Linea cartel controls the flow of runners and escapees. Bensman emphasized the relentless work of welders repairing holes in the border wall, with criminal elements driving migrants to risk crossing through dangerous routes. The segment concluded as Bensman described the constant struggle to keep up with repairs, highlighting the entrenched nature of the crisis.  In this segment, Dave Brat and Steve Bannon discuss the disconnect between the data presented by the media and the reality experienced by Americans. Brat highlights the populace’s frustration regarding the economy and the negative sentiment towards Bidenomics despite attempts to spin positive narratives. He references polls showing dissatisfaction with the national economy and the impact of inflation on purchasing power. The speakers emphasize the importance of focusing on the real economy rather than stock market fluctuations or minor interest rate changes. They express concerns about the country’s trajectory, suggesting it indicates late-stage capitalism and the rise of techno feudalism.  In this segment, author Jacqueline Toboroff talked to Natalie Winters about the deteriorating situation in New York City, particularly concerning safety issues on the subway and the rise in crime. Toboroff, a concerned mother and resident of NYC, expressed her fear and frustration about the current state of affairs, highlighting the dangers posed by junkies, mentally unstable individuals, criminals, and illegal immigrants. Despite the governor’s performative deployment of the National Guard, Toboroff reported that there seems to be a lack of meaningful efforts to address the problem.   She criticized the rhetoric of certain officials who downplay the severity of the situation and prioritize criminals’ rights over victims’ safety. She emphasized that the consequences of these policies extend beyond New York City and urged people in other areas to be vigilant.  EJ Antoni talked to Steve Bannon and  raised concerns about the latest jobs report, emphasizing the troubling trend of native-born Americans losing jobs while foreign-born workers, including potential illegal immigrants, are gaining employment. Antoni highlights the lack of transparency regarding how many of these foreign-born workers are undocumented and questions the impact of Biden’s immigration policies on job growth statistics. Additionally, there is criticism regarding the quality of jobs being created, focusing on the decrease in full-time employment. Overall, the segment raises questions about the accuracy and implications of current job market trends  In this segment, the discussion revolves around a recently passed 7.2 trillion spending bill in the U.S. House, which includes a two trillion dollar deficit. The guest, Ben Harwell, highlights the intentions behind certain initiatives, particularly regarding funding for Ukraine. He suggests that there may be attempts to spin the narrative to portray support for Ukraine as aligned with Donald Trump’s policies. However, Harwell argues that this is misleading, as there is resistance within the MAGA movement to allocate any additional funds to Ukraine. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the political dynamics at play and urges viewers to be vigilant in selecting their elected representatives. Overall, the segment delves into the complexities of political messaging and the potential implications of legislative decisions.  This segment’s conversation centers around recent legal developments, particularly regarding motions made in the context of ongoing legal proceedings. The guest, Kane from the Citizen Free Press, discusses how the media and the public have interpreted Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s rulings on these motions. He highlights the insights provided by Julie Kelly, a respected figure in the field, and emphasizes the significance of understanding the nuances of legal proceedings. Kane suggests that Judge Jackson’s decisions may have implications that are not immediately apparent and underscores the importance of following reliable sources for accurate analysis. Additionally, the conversation touches on broader political issues such as immigration policy and its potential impact on electoral dynamics.

Taunton, who has spent five years tracking migrant caravans, highlighted the lack of questions about why people are coming to the U.S. from South and Central America.
