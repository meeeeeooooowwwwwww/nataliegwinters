Darren J. Beattie, in this segment, praises JD Vance, explaining why he believes Vance was a good choice for President Trump despite Vance’s past “Never Trump” remarks. Beattie emphasizes that Vance’s book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” captured the underlying issues driving the America First movement, indicating Vance’s ideological alignment with Trump’s goals. Beattie also highlights Vance’s opposition from establishment figures in media and politics, like Lindsey Graham, who Beattie says worked against Vance’s political career. He contends that Vance’s stances, particularly against foreign wars and misuse of taxpayer money, align with the America First agenda, making him a suitable pick for Trump’s vice presidential candidate and a significant player in the movement’s future.  Darren Beattie criticizes the Secret Service for their failures during an attempted assassination of President Trump, suggesting these failures may be due to incompetence or intentional neglect. He points out how the shooter managed to get on a roof with a rifle, and despite multiple warnings from the crowd, Secret Service officers failed to act. Beattie finds it suspicious that the shooter had no discernible internet footprint and questions how he knew the roof would be unguarded. He also highlights a pattern of Secret Service failures, referencing the January 6th pipe bomb incident. Beattie calls for thorough investigations into these security breaches, emphasizing the need for accountability and better protection for Trump at future events.  In this conversation, Darren Beattie emphasizes that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the Secret Service, has redefined what it means to be a domestic extremist and terrorist, now largely targeting MAGA supporters. He suggests this redefinition might explain why threats to President Trump could slip through the cracks. Beattie also discusses the DHS’s weaponization against MAGA, mentioning figures like Bennie Thompson, who have pushed for actions against Trump. Beattie then discusses Elon Musk’s substantial financial support for pro-Trump PACs, highlighting Musk’s strategic move to ensure Trump’s victory for his business interests. He notes that significant figures in Silicon Valley are also backing Trump, creating a cascade effect of support within the tech industry. Beattie underscores the existential stakes for Musk and others if Trump does not win, asserting that this financial backing is crucial and encouraging for Trump’s campaign.  The filmmakers of “God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust,” David A.R. White and his team, joined Natalie Winters to discuss their upcoming film, which premieres on September 12th.

They reflect on the high expectations placed on the event, especially given the challenging conditions. The conversation shifts to analyzing an assassination attempt on Trump, criticizing the Secret Service for significant security lapses. They question the lack of immediate action and transparency, expressing concerns about future safety measures at Trump events. Kassam and Winters also ponder the political implications of the incident, suggesting that it might be used to push anti-Trump narratives and increase security at future rallies. They emphasize the need for accountability and thorough investigations to prevent such failures from recurring.  In a discussion at the RNC, US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene spoke with Natalie Winters about the concept of unity being pushed in the wake of President Trump’s recent legal challenges. Greene criticized the idea of uniting with Democrats, highlighting what she sees as their divisive actions over the past years, such as opening borders, vilifying conservatives, and weaponizing the justice system against Trump supporters. She pointed out specific incidents like the treatment of January 6th protesters and pro-life activists and criticized attempts to remove Trump’s Secret Service protection. Greene contrasted the left’s reaction to threats against Biden with how Trump supporters reacted to recent events, emphasizing the peaceful response of prayer rather than violence. She mentioned the upcoming hearing with the Secret Service Director, overseen by the Homeland Security Committee, to address accountability and transparency in ongoing investigations. Greene expressed skepticism about the government’s reliability, citing past misinformation and emphasizing the need for patience as Republicans work to bring accountability.

Cruz then talks about Trump’s resilience, likening him to a UFC fighter and the Terminator, highlighting his persistence despite multiple impeachments, indictments, and attacks. They both express the emotional impact of Trump’s appearance at the convention. The conversation shifts to an assassination attempt on Trump, criticizing the Secret Service’s leadership for security failures. Cruz calls for the resignation of the Secret Service director and the Secretary of Homeland Security, citing the preventable nature of the attempt. Bossie mentions ongoing security concerns for the convention in Milwaukee.

Dan Fleuette talked to Jayne Zirkle about the movie version of Kash Patel’s book Clinton Cash, set to premiere on Thursday at the RNC Convention.  The film will then be released to the public. Fleuette co-produced the film with WarRoom host Steve Bannon, a political prisoner, on the day his movie will premiere.  In their War Room conversation from the Republican Convention, Natalie Winters, who continued her rejection of calls for unity between Republicans, and Mike Davis, who discussed the legal and political challenges facing President Trump, Davis focused on Special Counsel Jack Smith. Davis noted that Judge Eileen Cannon ruled Smith’s appointment violated constitutional clauses because the special counsel office was not statutorily created and lacked proper oversight. He expects the Biden Justice Department’s appeal won’t be resolved before the election. He recommends that Trump’s acting attorney general dismiss the cases and investigate Smith if Trump is re-elected. Davis also criticized Gavin Newsom’s California legislation, which limits parental rights regarding children’s gender identity, as a severe state overreach. Winters highlighted Trump’s lead in recent polls, suggesting that the American public sees through Biden’s administration. Davis emphasized the need for early voting to avoid disruptions on Election Day. The conversation praised Trump’s judicial appointments, noting that the Supreme Court is now better positioned to check executive overreach. Both Winters and Davis rejected any notion of unity with Democrats, who they believe are undermining conservative values. They stressed the importance of Trump’s continued influence in the Republican Party and the need for a robust America First agenda to address these challenges effectively.  In a War Room discussion, Natalie Winters, who continued her theme of rejecting unity, and Terry Schilling criticized Governor Gavin Newsom’s legislation, which limits parental rights regarding children’s gender identity, arguing it places state authority above parental rights. Schilling emphasized this shift as unprecedented and part of a broader cultural warfare. He praised Trump’s judicial appointments for restoring constitutional principles essential to countering governmental overreach. Schilling urged Republicans to vote early in the 2024 election, warning of potential disruptions similar to the BLM riots in 2020. He attributed recent violence to Biden’s inflammatory rhetoric against Trump, asserting it fosters justification for extreme actions. Schilling stressed the need for a united Republican party to ensure Trump’s agenda if re-elected, cautioning against entrenched bureaucrats who could undermine his policies. He emphasized the importance of judicial decisions and accountability in restoring constitutional governance and countering the weaponization of law for cultural agendas.  In their discussion, Natalie Winters and Congressman Tim Burchette focused on the aftermath of the assassination attempt and its implications for oversight. Burchette criticized the Biden administration and DHS Secretary Mayorkas for alleged cover-ups and incompetence regarding the security breach. He emphasized the failure to secure the perimeter and raised concerns about the Secret Service’s preparedness and response. Burchette also criticized media coverage and perceived biases, suggesting a reluctance to investigate critically. He highlighted ongoing investigations by the House Oversight Committee into the incident and expressed skepticism about cooperation from the administration. The conversation underscored broader concerns within the GOP about security, media scrutiny, and partisan divides affecting legislative oversight.  In a conversation featuring Rep. Miller, Natalie Winters, and Tim Burchette, the focus was on the call for Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign amidst perceived failures. Miller emphasized the need for accountability, criticizing the Biden administration for various issues like Afghanistan and border security. There was frustration over the lack of consequences for these failures and a call for hearings to address them. The discussion shifted to the role of congressional committees in accountability and the perception that efforts had shifted from criminal referrals to preparing for Trump’s potential return. Miller stressed the importance of holding accountable those who compromise conservative values, expressing confidence in Trump’s ability to enforce accountability if re-elected. They also discussed messaging strategies at the RNC and challenges posed by Democratic policies like inflation and border security. The conversation touched on legislative efforts, including Miller’s bill on transgender athletes in sports, framed as protecting women’s opportunities under Title IX. Overall, the conversation highlighted frustrations with current policies, calls for accountability, and a strong emphasis on preparing for future political battles under Trump’s leadership.   In this segment of the War Room, Julian Murray from Delaware, Tamara Makai from Hawaii, and Delois Stallman from Virginia all expressed their enthusiastic support for President Trump and their roles within the Republican Party in their respective states. Julian highlighted efforts to deliver Delaware for Trump, emphasizing the absence of vote-by-mail and Trump’s popularity in the state. Tamara discussed challenges in Hawaii, aiming to turn the state red amidst opposition from wealthy figures like Zuckerberg and Bezos. Delois focused on Virginia’s potential to shift Republican, citing recent rallies and efforts to maximize voter turnout. Their unified message underscored grassroots efforts and state-level strategies to support Trump’s agenda and Republican victories.

She reflected on his significant role in shaping national discourse and expressed deep sympathy for his family. Rep. Greene then discussed President Trump’s upcoming speech, predicting it would address immigration and aim to unite Americans. She criticized the Biden administration’s handling of immigration and expressed concern over reports of resistance from Secretary Mayorkas and the FBI regarding ongoing investigations. Greene emphasized the need for transparency and accountability from federal agencies.

Bannon and honors the late Lou Dobbs. Kassam opened the Q&A by highlighting the film’s challenges, noting the dangers in making such a politically charged documentary. He acknowledged the bravery required to tackle topics that could put a target on the filmmakers’ heads, referencing recent events and the ongoing fight against corruption.

In their conversation, Matthew Whitaker and Dave Brat discuss the current state of the Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Merrick Garland, contrasting it with Whitaker’s tenure during the Trump administration. Whitaker highlights that during his time at the DOJ, justice was applied evenly, following the Constitution and the rule of law without political bias. He criticizes Garland for allegedly targeting individuals supportive of Trump, like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, and for the perceived selective application of the law. Whitaker emphasizes that the Supreme Court has recently upheld the rule of law, citing a significant opinion on the separation of powers and presidential immunity. He underscores the importance of this ruling for sustaining the constitutional republic. Whitaker also discusses how, under Trump’s administration, the DOJ focused on border security and reducing violent crime, claiming these efforts were effective. Brat asks Whitaker for examples of the DOJ’s impartiality under Trump, to which Whitaker responds by mentioning the handling of the Mueller investigation and how it concluded without politicization. Whitaker believes that current DOJ actions are politically motivated, using novel legal theories against Trump and his allies. They also touch on the Supreme Court’s recent decisions, including the overturning of the Chevron deference and the affirmation of presidential immunity for official acts. Whitaker argues that the left’s reaction to the immunity ruling is exaggerated, as this principle has been long-standing in U.S. history. Whitaker concludes by noting that recent Supreme Court decisions will impact ongoing cases against Trump, potentially leading to re-evaluation of evidence and delays in proceedings. Brat commends Whitaker’s clear and rational explanations of these complex legal and constitutional issues.  Scott Presler and Natalie Winters discuss the significant political shifts in Pennsylvania, highlighting Presler’s grassroots efforts and voter registration successes. Presler shares impressive statistics, noting that the Democratic voter advantage has shrunk from 595,000 to 75,000 in two years. This progress is attributed to a focused outreach to various demographic groups, including Amish, truckers, hunters, and young men. Presler emphasizes the importance of targeting communities like the Amish, hunters, and truckers and details efforts to engage these groups through events and direct interactions. He also mentions the increasing support among young men, mainly black and Hispanic males, and Jewish community members following recent political developments. Winters and Presler also discuss the impact of the recent presidential debate on public opinion. Many voters perceive President Biden as unfit and President Trump as presidential. Presler believes this perception shift is reflected in voter registration trends and polling data. Presler encourages active political involvement, urging people to download the Early Vote Action app to participate in voter registration efforts and volunteer as election day workers. He stresses the importance of having election day workers to ensure election integrity, especially in states with extended early voting periods.  Natalie Winters and Savannah Hernandez discuss a shocking incident in San Francisco during a Pride event. Hernandez describes witnessing fully naked men, public sex acts, and urination in front of children, with police officers not intervening. She highlights the double standards in law enforcement, contrasting the lack of action in San Francisco with the severe penalties faced by those who damage pride flags or political figures like Steve Bannon. Hernandez expresses concern over the exposure of such acts to children and criticizes the Biden administration for supporting these events. Winters and Hernandez both criticize the mainstream Democratic Party for pushing these values in classrooms and fear these behaviors will be normalized in educational materials. Hernandez also points out that public nudity, which was banned in 2012, is permitted during such events with city approval.  In their conversation, Dave Brat and Ben Harnwell discussed a significant conference held at the Vatican a decade ago, focusing on wealth creation from a Christian perspective. Ben organized the meeting to counter the Marxist undertones in Pope Francis’s pontificate. They highlighted Steve Bannon’s involvement in the conference and his prescient views on global populist movements, issues like Islam, Russia, and economic policies. They also touched on Bannon’s advocacy for Judeo-Christian values and critiques of socialism. Their dialogue underscored themes of moral foundations in Western civilization and critiques of historical mischaracterizations of fascism and socialism.  Steve Bannon’s intense interview with Vaughn Hillyard on MSNBC before he surrendered to the Danbury Correctional facility on Monday delved into various contentious issues. Bannon criticized MSNBC’s coverage of executive power, arguing against expanded surveillance measures and emphasizing recent legal setbacks for executive authority. He defended his actions during the January 6th committee investigation, asserting his adherence to legal strategies to contest election results. Bannon accused MSNBC of bias and collaboration with the Justice Department, highlighting perceived injustices and calling for investigations into alleged abuses of power. He outlined his priorities for the future, including immigration policy reform, fiscal conservatism, and ending military engagements abroad. Bannon’s determined defense of himself, President Trump, and the MAGA movement underscored his ongoing influence within the MAGA movement and his commitment to challenging establishment norms.

In a recent War Room discussion, Dave Brat and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs discussed critical issues facing the nation, highlighting their frustrations with Washington’s bureaucracy and political accountability. The conversation opened with a tribute to Steve Bannon, emphasizing his resilience and the current political climate, which they described as a period where “weeks feel like decades.” The discussion centered around three major issues: the border invasion, two trillion dollar deficits, and endless wars, all of which Biggs asserts he consistently opposes. Brat commended Biggs for his unwavering commitment to truth, despite the challenges of operating within what he called “the swamp.” A significant portion of the conversation was dedicated to the Secret Service’s handling of a security breach involving a suspicious individual during a high-profile event attended by former President Trump. Biggs criticized the agency’s failure to maintain adequate security measures and suggested that the Secret Service did not act on critical information that could have prevented a potential threat. He emphasized the need for accountability and questioned whether the shooter acted alone, pointing to possible connections to someone associated with the FBI. Brat and Biggs also discussed the broader issue of accountability in Congress, lamenting the lack of consequences for bad behavior and fiscal irresponsibility. Biggs argued for defunding certain agencies and holding individuals accountable to curb abuses within the administrative state. He expressed disappointment with his colleagues’ reluctance to push for significant legislative changes. The conversation concluded with a plea for the release of Steve Bannon, whom Brat and Biggs consider a political prisoner. They criticized the judiciary’s treatment of Bannon and emphasized the importance of advocating for fair treatment. Biggs pledged to continue fighting for accountability and justice, stressing the need for strong leadership to address the nation’s pressing issues.  In this War Room conversation, Dave Brat and Catherine Engelbrecht discussed their ongoing efforts to ensure election integrity, emphasizing the critical nature of their work amidst political uncertainty. Engelbrecht praised as a War Room hero, explained the primary objectives of her organization, True the Vote, which focuses on enhancing the accuracy of voter rolls, addressing gaps in polling places, and encouraging volunteer involvement. She announced the launch of Vote Alert, an app designed to enable voters to report on-the-ground irregularities, and a Spanish version called Nesto, aimed at engaging the Latino community. Engelbrecht highlighted recent developments in Wisconsin, where the reintroduction of drop boxes has become a focal point of her group’s efforts. She emphasized working closely with local sheriffs to monitor these voting methods, aiming to prevent potential fraud. Brat and Engelbrecht expressed gratitude for the support from their community, recognizing the unsung heroes who contribute to these efforts. Engelbrecht urged the War Room Posse to take actionable steps by signing up at TrueTheVote.org for updates on projects and accessing the IV3.us app to monitor local voter rolls for ineligible records. She noted significant victories, challenging over 700,000 questionable records across 1,300 counties. Engelbrecht underscored the urgency of active participation by addressing the broader political landscape, viewing the current political climate as a spiritual battle requiring voter turnout and civic engagement. Engelbrecht and Brat acknowledged the uphill battle ahead, emphasizing the importance of unity and perseverance in defending fundamental liberties. Engelbrecht concluded by stressing the need for moral action, regardless of party affiliation, and called for renewed dedication to the cause of freedom and democracy.  This conversation on the War Room with Dave Brat and Alex DeGrasse discusses a broad analysis of the current political landscape, emphasizing key dynamics involving Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party’s strategy for the upcoming elections. The discussion begins with DeGrasse, Executive Director of Team Elise Stefanik, outlining the critical role of grassroots activism, encouraging supporters to engage as poll watchers and volunteers to secure the vote. He highlights a recent trend of increased enthusiasm among Democrats, particularly within the African-American community, following Harris’s growing prominence. The conversation focuses on Harris’s political position, noting her perceived weaknesses and potential impact as a candidate. Brat and DeGrasse discuss how Harris has assumed responsibility for many of President Joe Biden’s policies, painting her as an “enabler-in-chief” with policies positioned to the left of Biden. The conversation emphasizes Harris’s low approval ratings and job performance, branding her as a weaker candidate for the Democrats. However, DeGrasse notes the strategic challenge Republicans face, as Harris hasn’t been as thoroughly defined in the public eye compared to Biden. The hosts also discuss the possibility of significant moves by former President Obama, suggesting he might influence the Democratic establishment to support an alternative candidate. DeGrasse stresses the necessity for the Republican Party to capitalize on Harris’s weaknesses by emphasizing her policies, particularly her statements on immigration and other issues, in critical swing districts.  Natalie Winters opened the show with strong commentary on recent political events and controversies. She suggests there’s an underlying agenda to sideline Steve Bannon by keeping him in jail. Natalie assures listeners that War Room will prioritize the “signal over the noise,” providing clear insights into the complex issues at play. Winters expresses disappointment at accusations of sexism following criticisms of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies and affirmative action in hiring, specifically within the Secret Service and the events on Saturday, July 13, when President Trump was shot, along with three other Americans, one who died from his wounds. She references a statement by the DHS dismissing these concerns as sexist and argues against the notion that DEI policies are to blame for security failures. Winters argues that this is an intentional failure by the Biden administration rather than incompetence, questioning the regime’s actions across various fronts, including border security, the economy, and President Joe Biden’s mental health. She insists that blaming DEI policies gives the administration a way to dodge responsibility for these issues, particularly in the context of the alleged assassination attempt. Additionally, Winters criticizes Biden’s inadequate communication, referencing his unofficial endorsement of Kamala Harris and suggesting that his erratic behavior is a sign of his inability to lead the nation effectively. She calls for invoking the 25th Amendment, asserting that Biden is unfit for office. Winters concludes by warning that America’s adversaries—and even allies—are watching and laughing at the nation’s perceived weakness, suggesting that they see it as an opportunity to take advantage of a lack of strong leadership.  Part One: The discussion between Darren Beattie and Natalie Winters goes into the alleged incompetence and potential malfeasance within the Secret Service and its handling of recent security incidents. Beattie, a former Biden administration official, criticizes the Biden administration and Secret Service, specifically focusing on the agency’s response to security threats. He begins by commenting on the strange circumstances surrounding the alleged assassination attempt on July 13th and questions whether the failure to prevent it was due to “diversity” hires or a deliberate act by the “deep state.” Beattie argues that the incompetence displayed could either be criminal negligence or intentional complicity, suggesting that members of the Secret Service should face legal consequences for their actions. Beattie further analyzes the Secret Service’s response to the discovery of a pipe bomb near the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters on January 6, 2021. He highlights how the Secret Service’s response seemed suspiciously relaxed, allowing schoolchildren to pass near the bomb without immediate action. Beattie speculates that the agents might have known the bomb was fake, raising questions about how they could have known this in advance. This leads him to question the agency’s credibility and suggests a possible cover-up or intentional mishandling of the situation.  Part Two:  In a recent conversation on War Room, Natalie Winters and Mike Benz discussed the potential political downfall of President Joe Biden, particularly in light of a letter from former intelligence community members suggesting Biden step down. Benz had previously predicted that such a letter would signal Biden’s end due to his strong ties with the foreign policy establishment, or “the blob.” This establishment, which includes the State Department, Department of Defense, and CIA, has been Biden’s power base throughout his political career, as he was once dubbed “Mr. Foreign Policy” by the Council on Foreign Relations. Benz highlighted that 48 former members of the intelligence and national security community recently signed a letter suggesting Biden should resign, echoing the 51 signatories who previously labeled Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation. Among the signatories is Rosa Brooks, a former high-level Pentagon official and head of the Transition Integrity Project, which reportedly simulated strategies to ensure Biden’s presidency even if Trump won the election. Benz noted that on the same day as the letter’s release, a protest group called “Pass the Torch, Joe” emerged, calling for Biden to step down, drawing parallels to tactics used to challenge Trump. The conversation shifted to the influence of powerful entities like the Transition Integrity Project and figures like Nils Gilman and Reid Hoffman, who have been involved in controversial political maneuvers. They discussed how the concept of democracy is threatened by oligarchic networks willing to undermine elections to maintain power. The discussion also touched on theories surrounding an assassination attempt on Trump and the alleged role of certain individuals and groups. Benz noted parallels between the January 6 Capitol riot and other political events, highlighting concerns about democracy and governance manipulation. Part One:  Part Two:

In a Tuesday WarRoom conversation, Peter Navarro and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs discussed the implementation challenges of the First Step Act of 2018, which aims to reduce recidivism and the federal prison population through earned time credits for inmates. Navarro, who experienced the federal prison system firsthand, criticized the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for failing to implement the act effectively, resulting in delayed releases by six to twelve months. Biggs supported Navarro’s claims, noting that BOP Director Peters acknowledged the backlog affecting approximately 60,000 inmates. Biggs expressed frustration over federal overreach, stating, “There are far too many federal crimes. The founders had it right: criminal law is supposed to be left to the states. Instead, we have over 40,000 federal offenses, leading to absurd imprisonments.” He argued that reducing federal crimes could prevent such issues and highlighted that prisoners compliant with state laws still faced incarceration due to federal violations. Navarro shared a poignant story about an inmate who missed his mother’s passing due to delayed release, emphasizing the human cost of these inefficiencies. Biggs noted that while Peters seemed committed to resolving these issues, the solution involves a comprehensive review of federal crimes and better resource allocation to implement the First Step Act properly. Both emphasized the potential $5 billion in savings and advocated for swift changes to improve the system, suggesting that electronic monitoring and home confinement could reduce costs and facilitate smoother transitions for eligible inmates.  Peter Navarro and Mark Mitchell from Rasmussen discussed recent polling data and their meaning for the upcoming election, focusing on a controversial Reuters poll. Navarro opened the discussion with skepticism, suggesting that the poll was "pure propaganda for the left.” The conversation then dove into the methodology behind the poll, with Mitchell explaining why he believes the data is flawed. He emphasized the importance of polling likely voters rather than just registered voters, stating, "Rasmussen always polls likely voters because we think it’s a better reflection of what happens in November.” He argued that the Reuters poll’s sample of registered voters might not accurately predict election outcomes, especially since the entire industry shifts to likely voters as the election approaches. Mitchell also highlighted the recent Republican National Committee (RNC) event’s impact on polling, noting a significant post-RNC bounce for Donald Trump. He contrasted this with the Reuters poll’s surprising findings, which showed Kamala Harris outperforming Joe Biden against Trump, something Mitchell found inconsistent with previous polling trends. “I’ve polled about Kamala Harris a lot of times, and never once in any one of our polls has Kamala Harris ever outperformed Joe Biden,” Mitchell stated, underscoring his doubts about the poll’s credibility. The discussion also covered key election issues, with Mitchell noting that Republicans have an edge on almost every issue that matters to voters, particularly the economy and border security. Navarro and Mitchell agreed that the Democrats’ focus on "Orange man bad, abortion, abortion, abortion” might not resonate as effectively as the Republican emphasis on policy issues. They concluded that the election might hinge more on policy than personality despite the chaotic political climate.  Natalie Winters discussed Kimberly Cheatle’s resignation on Tuesday and told the WarRoom audience that she hopes criminal changes will follow.  In this segment on War Room, Scott Pressler shared significant political developments in Pennsylvania, highlighting a notable shift from Democratic to Republican control in various counties. Pressler celebrated the successful flip of Bucks County, stating, "We together flipped Bucks County, Pennsylvania from Blue to Red. This is something… a County that four years ago had 15,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans now has a plurality of registered Republicans.” He emphasized the importance of this shift for upcoming elections, asserting, "If we are able to win Bucks County, this November we will win Pennsylvania. And therefore, we will win the White House and we will have saved Western Civilization.” Pressler outlined future goals, mentioning, "We are 1,370 voters away from flipping Luzerne County from Blue to Red” and targeting Erie, Chester, Monroe, and Center Counties. He stressed the need for continued voter registration and turnout efforts, saying, "We must be more diligent, we must work harder than ever to continue registering new voters and to turn out these voters.” Addressing challenges, Pressler expressed frustration with Pennsylvania’s Department of State for not providing transparency regarding voter registration data. He criticized their response to concerns about illegal voting, noting, "The automatic photo registration… they say they have checks and balances to ensure that no illegal aliens are getting registered to vote.” Pressler also cautioned against complacency and urged focus on policy over personal attacks. He advised supporters to concentrate on Kamala Harris’s policies rather than her personal attributes, asserting, "I encourage you to focus on policy. This is a woman that spent her career locking up Americans while allowing illegal aliens to break our laws.” Finally, Pressler appealed for support for his organization, Early Vote Action, to further their voter outreach efforts, saying, "If you want direct face-to-face voter contact… please consider chipping in whatever you can.” Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Congressman Tim Burchett discussed significant developments related to Steve Bannon and broader political concerns. Burchett expressed his frustration with the House’s handling of Bannon’s case, highlighting a bill to invalidate the January 6th committee’s subpoenas. He criticized the committee as “invalid” due to its composition. He suggested that its actions, including Bannon’s wrongful conviction, should be reconsidered: “The subpoenas would be invalid, and then Steve Bannon’s wrongful conviction would be invalid.” Natalie Winters echoed Burchett and also lamented the slow response from House Republicans, questioning why significant actions were delayed until just before Bannon’s surrender. He attributed the delay to a lack of courage among GOP members, asserting: “We don’t have any guts,” and criticized the party’s leadership for not prioritizing Bannon’s case over other issues. Regarding security failures, Burchett strongly disapproved of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle, especially regarding the January 6th incident. He accused Cheadle and her team of negligence, suggesting that their incompetence contributed to the harm that occurred: “Clearly, this reeks, it is awful.” He emphasized the need for immediate and thorough investigations into security lapses. Burchett also warned against relying on ineffective oversight committees, predicting that investigations would ultimately lead to calls for more funding rather than substantive results. He emphasized the necessity of electing strong, principled leaders to address the nation’s issues. He criticized the entrenched, compromised figures in both parties: “We need to put strong leaders in and support them.”  In a this conversation with Natalie Winters, Mike McCormick offered his insights into the current political landscape, particularly regarding Kamala Harris’s potential candidacy. McCormick predicted that Kamala Harris would likely become the Democratic nominee, suggesting that the upcoming Chicago convention would be marked by intense political maneuvering and "Chicago thuggery.” He speculated on the dynamics of the Democat convention, noting that while there had been rumors about Michelle Obama potentially entering the race, he believed this was unlikely due to her past dissatisfaction with her time in the White House. McCormick also delved into the relationships and tensions within the Democratic Party. He pointed out that Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden had a history of regular meetings, which he claimed were part of a deal to position Clinton for the 2016 presidential run. McCormick recounted how Biden was reportedly upset about not being able to run for president earlier, a sentiment reflected in some leaked emails involving Biden and Clinton. He did not shy away from criticism of Biden, calling him both a “quitter” and a “criminal,” and referenced his book, The Case for Impeaching Joe Biden, which details alleged criminal activities involving Biden in Ukraine and other controversies.

Brian Glenn opened live from the Bonjangles convention center in Charlotte, North Carolina, with live remarks from rally attendees. Part One:  Part Two of the WarRoom opening includes remarks about the conditions of the Southern Border under Democrat Joe Biden with Kamala Harris as the “Border Czar,” pointing to no change in policy for the American people from the Democrat border policies.  Part Three of the WarRoom live open from the Trump rally in North Carolina:  Max Matheu criticized the Biden administration’s alleged attempts to manipulate elections, arguing that they are using taxpayer dollars to fund voter registration efforts in Native American communities as part of a strategy to influence the 2024 election. He described this as an overhaul of the federal election system, claiming that the Democrats aim to create new voters in key areas to gain an advantage. Matheu also pointed out that federal agencies may not have the authority to conduct these registration efforts, as even ethics attorneys have raised doubts. He urged supporters to stay informed through Heritage Oversight’s social media channels.  In this segment, Max Metheu highlighted concerns about the Secret Service’s handling of phone records related to investigations, stressing the need for transparency and accountability. He criticized the potential loss or mismanagement of these records, arguing that a special or select committee must have the authority to obtain and scrutinize them. Metheu stated that the failure to properly maintain and provide access to phone records indicates a broader issue of systemic corruption within federal agencies, emphasizing that these agencies are not fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. This lack of transparency, he suggests, is part of the “business as usual” approach that allows key information to be swept under the rug, hindering genuine investigation efforts and enabling political manipulation. He further implied that phone records could reveal significant insights into the actions and communications of key figures during critical moments, and their proper examination is essential for uncovering any misconduct or unethical behavior. Metheu insists that only through a special commission with comprehensive investigatory powers can there be a legitimate attempt to address these issues and prevent future occurrences.  In the discussion between Natalie Winters and Julie Kelly, Kelly offers a critical perspective on FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony regarding the January 6th events. She expresses skepticism about Wray’s ability to provide a fair assessment, describing the FBI as “hopelessly corrupt, partisan, and political” under his leadership. Kelly emphasizes the lack of accountability for the construction of the gallows on Capitol grounds, a key symbol of the January 6th insurrection. Despite over three and a half years having passed, she notes that “no one has been identified with constructing those gallows,” highlighting the FBI’s failure to address this aspect of the investigation. Kelly also critiques the FBI’s handling of confidential human sources (CHSs) during the January 6th events. She mentions that during the Proud Boys trial, the DOJ admitted to having 8 to 9 CHSs embedded in the group, but suggests the actual number may have been higher. Furthermore, Kelly references an impending DOJ Inspector General report, which is expected to reveal details about the FBI’s role and the number of informants involved in January 6th. She anticipates this report will be “pretty explosive” and could shed light on the FBI’s activities during that period, questioning whether DOJ officials are delaying its release.

In an interview with Natalie Winters, Catherine Engelbrecht from True the Vote highlighted significant concerns about election integrity, focusing on potential voter fraud linked to ActBlue and non-citizen voting. Engelbrecht described the alleged scheme, where donors unwittingly contribute to Democratic candidates through small, frequent donations under their names, stating, “This is identity theft, this is wire fraud.” Engelbrecht argued that Democrats exploit voter rolls to target defenseless individuals, particularly lower-income ones, who might not fight back. “They are exploiting the defenseless, and it’s disgusting,” she remarked, stressing the necessity for increased citizen involvement. Despite improvements in citizen engagement, Engelbrecht rated election security progress since 2020 as insufficient, around “50%.” She expressed concerns about mail-in voting, deemed the “least secure way” to vote, and criticized the push for it despite security risks. Engelbrecht also highlighted issues with non-citizen registrations, blaming outdated voter roll maintenance and the National Voter Registration Act’s integration with social services, which obscures citizenship verification. Engelbrecht urged for more robust measures, noting, “There is absolute evidence that non-citizens are being registered.” She encouraged citizens to engage in projects like the 611 project to pressure state representatives to clean voter rolls, warning, “We’re running out of time.” Engelbrecht concluded by inviting participation and promoting transparency and accountability in the election process. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters criticized Kamala Harris’s role as the “Border Czar,” emphasizing how media outlets like Axios, The New York Times, and CNN have subtly altered headlines to distance Harris from the border crisis. Winters noted, “They do not want to own what is happening…because they know that it is political suicide,” suggesting that these policies have alienated the Democratic base. The discussion highlighted a distrust in the government, pointing to systemic failures across multiple sectors, from education to public safety. Winters argued that these issues reflect a deeper intention to undermine American interests, claiming, “Our elites are much more sinister, nefarious, calculating, and intentional.” She concluded that it is up to American citizens to challenge these failures, stating that the government is more interested in its agenda than genuinely serving the people. This conversation underscores ongoing concerns about political accountability and public trust.  In a recent discussion with Natalie Winters, Tiffany Justice shared promising developments regarding the Title IX lawsuit that Moms for Liberty is spearheading. Justice highlighted that a judge clarified a previous ruling, allowing current and future members of Moms for Liberty to exempt their children’s schools from the Biden Administration’s new Title IX regulations. She explained, “The judge clarified his order on Friday and said that not only do current Moms for Liberty members qualify…but also any future Moms for Liberty members.” This is a significant victory, as it means that schools associated with Moms for Liberty members are not required to implement these controversial Title IX changes, which include allowing boys on girls’ sports teams, boys in girls’ locker rooms, and withholding information from parents about gender transitions. Justice emphasized the importance of this ruling, stating, “If you’re a Moms for Liberty member, your school cannot enforce those new regulation changes.” She encouraged parents to join the organization, noting that new members can also ensure their child’s school is exempt. Justice thanked the Southeastern Legal Foundation for their support, remarking on their crucial role in this legal battle. To support the cause, she urged people to text "Liberty” to a specific number to join and protect their children’s rights. Part One:  Part Two:  In a discussion with Joe Allen, Connie Elliott, a strategic analyst on the Committee on the Present Danger: China, addresses the intensifying issues of tribalization and political polarization in the digital age. Elliott highlights what she describes as how the “bizarre digital environment” exacerbates these natural problems by creating “digital silos” that foster hatred among individuals. She explains that generative machine learning systems have transformed the information landscape, making traditional information campaigns indistinguishable. These systems optimize information environments, influencing behavior and decision-making. Elliott points out that experiments like Google’s, which manipulated user behavior in crowded environments, demonstrate the power of these systems: “The moment you take the smartphone, you’ve basically signed up for a multitude of psychological experiments.” She also touches on the psychological impact of search engine manipulation and the absence of legal protections against subliminal advertising, stating, “There’s no protection in law at all.” Allen adds that this manipulation contributes to phenomena like “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” where individuals react irrationally to specific triggers.  In a discussion on misinformation, Joe Allen and Shane Cashman explore the concept of “post-reality,” where, according to Cashman, “everything can be true and nothing is true.” They discuss how the internet has accelerated this phenomenon, creating a “mutated fractured world” where people can find information to support any belief with a simple Google search. Cashman highlights how AI and deep fakes exacerbate this issue, making it difficult to discern truth even when witnessing events firsthand. He points to an example where a video allegedly showing a fake conversation between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris was analyzed as a deep fake, illustrating how easily manipulated information can gain traction. Cashman explains, “Even if you’re a witness to it, you don’t really know.” This conversation underscores the challenges of navigating a digital landscape filled with misinformation and manipulated content.  In this discussion with Joe Allen, Tim Hinchcliffe highlights digital identity concerns, emphasizing its role in tracking and controlling individuals. Hinchcliffe notes that digital ID systems are designed to “eliminate all anonymity,” allowing for precise tracking of misinformation sources. He describes these systems as a “never-ending nudge system” to manipulate behavior, potentially leading to social credit systems. Citing the World Economic Forum, Hinchcliffe explains that digital identity determines access to “products, services, and information” and can simultaneously restrict opportunities. While Melinda Gates promotes digital IDs for financial inclusion, Hinchcliffe warns that they serve as a “track and trace” tool, monitoring social media activity, medical records, voting behavior, and more. Quoting Klaus Schwab, he states that monitoring systems are extending to people, creating a world where “authoritarianism is easier” due to “total visibility and traceability.” Hinchcliffe argues that the third world often serves as a “laboratory” for these systems, exploiting desperate populations willing to surrender privacy for access.

Representative Bob Good expresses frustration with Congress’s lack of progress on key issues, criticizing House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to send Congress on a District work period in August. Good argues that Congress should have stayed in session to address the nation’s pressing issues and complete the necessary spending bills. He stated, “the point is still well made by the Speaker promised back early in the year that if we didn’t complete our 12 required spending bills, he would cancel the August recess.” Good blames Congress’s inefficiency on a “lack of resolve” and “toughness” within the Republican Party, leading to continuous concessions to the Senate. Good also highlights the need for effective investigations into significant issues, including the Secret Service’s role in alleged election interference, stating, “There would be no basis for confidence based on past history, but we do have the opportunity to be different this time.” He calls for a task force composed of “real Fighters” to ensure accountability. Ultimately, Good questions the Republican Party’s ability to deliver meaningful results for the American people, warning that continued failure may undermine public trust. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters expresses her thoughts and ideas about Congress being on Recess now, saying she is unhappy about that Speaker Johnson didn’t keep his word to hold Congress to address spending bills.  Trevor Loudon, an investigative reporter, highlights Kamala Harris’s alleged connections to radical leftist circles and Chinese communist influence. He points out that Harris’s father was a “bonafide Marxist economist,” and throughout her career, she has been influenced by Marxist circles, including figures like Willie Brown, a long-time Communist Party supporter. Loudon argues that Harris’s rise in politics is supported by Steve Phillips, a Maoist who aims to mobilize minority groups and progressive whites to shift America towards socialism. He emphasizes Harris’s focus on racial politics, noting her support for Black Lives Matter and its alleged ties to Chinese communist organizations. Loudon suggests that Harris is “the most left-wing candidate” and warns of her potential influence on policies, particularly regarding immigration and racial issues. He also claims that Chinese-linked organizations are working to mobilize voters to secure Harris’s political success. Loudon stresses the need for awareness of these influences in American politics. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Miranda Devine’s article for the New York Post exposes significant issues within the FBI, highlighting a lack of confidence from local law enforcement. According to whistleblower reports, local police view the FBI as politically biased and acting as enforcers for the Biden Department of Justice. This mistrust intensified after the FBI’s actions following the January 6th Capitol riot, where non-violent Trump supporters were aggressively pursued. The FBI’s raid on Donald Trump’s residence in Florida further eroded trust, causing local cops nationwide to believe the agency is corrupt. As a result, police are reluctant to share intelligence with the FBI, raising concerns for national security and public safety. The recent assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, exemplifies these issues, showcasing failures in cooperation between the FBI, Secret Service, and local law enforcement. Devine emphasizes that partisan bias and incompetence within these agencies compromise their ability to effectively protect national figures and the public. Part One:  Part Two:  In a recent interview, T.J. Harker emphasized the need to end the Federal Reserve and control fiat currency, aligning with libertarian views. He discussed his article on the “post-constitutional order” in America, which drew criticism from the Cato Institute. Harker questioned whether a constitutional order still exists, suggesting it’s either dead or on life support. He highlighted the misuse of the legal system, known as “lawfare,” where the criminal justice system is weaponized against political opponents. Harker argued that figures like federal prosecutor Jack Smith and district attorneys Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg could be prosecuted under existing laws for their actions against Donald Trump. He suggested that these prosecutions are politically motivated, with broad statutes allowing for the criminalization of legitimate conduct. Harker also speculated on Kamala Harris’s political strategy, given her prosecutorial background. He suggested that she might gain political advantage by dismissing federal cases against Trump, framing it as an effort to unify the country and restore the rule of law. However, he acknowledged that such a move is unlikely. Overall, Harker emphasized the importance of addressing these legal and political issues to maintain a fair constitutional order.  Tim Hinchcliffe discussed the evolving field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and their intersection with globalism and politics. He criticized Yuval Noah Harari and Nina Farahani for their strong but pessimistic views on BCIs, which they argue could have more risks than benefits. Despite their high-profile platforms, like the World Economic Forum, Hinchliffe is skeptical of their motives, suggesting that these figures might warn about and exploit the technology’s potential. Hinchcliffe outlined the current state of BCIs, from non-invasive devices like smart tattoos to invasive technologies such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which aims to restore mobility in disabled patients. He noted that while Harari and Farahani are vocal about the dangers of these technologies, the World Economic Forum seems to balance concern with enthusiasm for their possibilities. He highlighted a shift from the Internet of Things to the Internet of Bodies and, eventually, the Internet of Brains, where BCIs could enable brain-to-brain communication and shared thoughts. Hinchcliffe warned that this could lead to manipulative "memetic warfare,” where narratives shape behavior and policies without relying on concrete data. He urged caution, particularly with right-wing figures involved in transhumanism and their potential influence on policy, given their connections to defense and intelligence agencies.

Dave Brat and Rosemary Jenks discussed the Immigration Accountability Project (IAP) on the War Room, highlighting the critical need for accountability in immigration policy. Jenks emphasized that holding politicians accountable, including the Biden Administration and DHS Secretary Mayorkas, is essential. She criticized current immigration practices, stating that many immigrants enter illegally, and policies like “parole” are abused to allow quasi-legal entry. Jenks noted that Mexico is more effectively securing its border than the U.S., partly to help the Biden Administration claim lower illegal immigration numbers. She cited a House Judiciary Committee report revealing the Biden Administration has released 5.3 million illegal immigrants into the U.S., with an additional 1.9 million known “gotaways.” Jenks argued that an incoming administration, like Trump’s, should terminate parole programs and reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy to prevent catch and release. She also highlighted the economic and social costs of illegal immigration, including crime and strain on public resources, and described the deadly impact of fentanyl smuggling by Mexican cartels with Chinese assistance. The IAP aims to hold accountable those responsible for these immigration issues.  Colonel John Mills, retired, and Dave Brat discussed the geopolitical landscape, emphasizing the influence of China on various global conflicts. Mills identified at least 14 regional conflicts, many of which he linked to China’s strategic ambitions to undermine the U.S. He highlighted major hot spots including Ukraine, where he described Russia as acting as a proxy for China, and the Middle East, where Iranian-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are significantly influenced by China. Mills also pointed out China’s presence in Latin America, including Chinese spy bases in Cuba and involvement with drug cartels. He emphasized the rise of populist leaders in the region who are pro-American but are receiving minimal support from the U.S. administration. In Asia, Mills discussed China’s strategic moves in Taiwan and the Solomon Islands, suggesting that China is bypassing direct confrontation with Taiwan by securing other strategic locations. Mills criticized the current U.S. administration’s lack of clarity, resolve, and authenticity in foreign policy, contrasting it with the previous administration’s success in maintaining peace and prosperity. He argued for a robust policy that includes cutting off financial resources to China, strengthening diplomatic, military, and intelligence efforts, and showing genuine commitment to strategic partners.  Dave Walsh, a War Room energy expert, provided insights on the Biden administration’s recent energy policies and their global implications. He criticized the release of 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, highlighting its negligible impact on U.S. gas prices given the country’s high daily consumption. Walsh emphasized the bipartisan responsibility, noting that many Republicans also supported the reserve’s depletion. Walsh discussed the geopolitical landscape, particularly the increased flow of Russian pipeline gas into Western Europe, despite ongoing conflicts and sanctions. He pointed out that Europe continues to rely on significant quantities of Russian LNG, contradicting their support for the Ukraine war effort. This reliance has led to increased U.S. exports of LNG and crude oil to Europe, which in turn has affected domestic energy prices. Regarding China, Walsh mentioned their strategic energy alignments, including pipeline projects with Russia, Iran, and Iraq, which will secure their energy needs in the long term. Meanwhile, China has capitalized on boycotted Russian oil supplies. Walsh concluded by stressing the need for the U.S. to educate its representatives on energy policies and their geopolitical consequences.  EJ Antoni and Dave Brat discussed the implications of a potential Trump presidency on the U.S. economy, particularly in relation to the bond market. Antoni critiqued the Wall Street Journal’s negative outlook on Trump’s return, arguing that similar predictions in 2016 proved unfounded. He highlighted that Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies previously bolstered manufacturing and wages without causing inflation, contrary to critics’ claims. Antoni explained that the current rise in interest rates is due to increased debt and concerns about the Treasury’s ability to repay, exacerbated by the Biden administration’s policies. He contended that Trump’s economic policies would alleviate stress on the Treasury markets, as they did during his first term. The expectation of strong economic growth under Trump would likely shift investments from low-yield bonds to higher-return stocks, forcing the Treasury to offer more competitive yields. Antoni emphasized that the current economic challenges are a result of existing policies, not future Trump policies, and predicted that a Trump presidency would restore robust economic growth, attracting investments away from low-yield bonds to more lucrative opportunities.  Natalie Winters and Ken Klippenstein explored the weaponization of the federal government against critics of the ruling class. Winters introduced Klippenstein, an investigative journalist known for exposing the collusion between big tech and federal agencies. They focused on Klippenstein’s latest findings about the IRS, which allegedly targets individuals threatening the government’s ability to govern, as outlined in new documents he obtained. Klippenstein explained that the IRS manual prioritizes criminal investigations based on national security implications, a shift from traditional targets like foreign terror groups to domestic groups post-2021. This realignment intensified after events like January 6th and the George Floyd protests, leading to the creation of a domestic terrorism strategy under Biden. The conversation highlighted the IRS’s expanded role in national security, working closely with agencies like the FBI and Homeland Security. Despite increased funding for the IRS, Klippenstein argued that the lack of transparency fuels public distrust and conspiracy theories. He emphasized the importance of primary source documentation in investigative reporting to uncover the true scope of these governmental actions. Klippenstein also discussed the challenges journalists face due to the government’s secretive nature and the media’s reliance on authorized disclosures and information from think tanks and advocacy groups. He encouraged readers to engage with primary sources to form their own conclusions about these critical issues.  In a conversation between Tiffany Justice from Moms for Liberty and Natalie Winters, Justice shared news about a legal victory against Title IX changes proposed by the Biden Administration. The victory in the 10th Circuit means that public schools in Kansas, Alaska, Utah, and Wyoming cannot implement the new Title IX changes, which aimed to redefine sex to include gender identity and sexual orientation. This ruling impacts schools attended by members of Young America’s Foundation, Female Athletes United, and Moms for Liberty members. Justice explained that the judge ruled the changes as unconstitutional, violating the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. She urged listeners to join Moms for Liberty by July 15 to ensure their schools are protected from these changes. The discussion also covered the Biden Administration’s shifting stance on gender-affirming care for minors. Despite recent claims of opposition to gender surgeries for kids, the Administration continues to support gender-affirming care, which Justice criticized. She emphasized that the Administration’s push for gender ideology is losing public support and could affect their chances in future elections. Justice concluded by urging parents to join Moms for Liberty to protect their children and public schools from the implementation of these Title IX changes.  Mike Benz discussed President Joe Biden’s perceived cognitive decline and its implications for national security, criticizing Biden’s longstanding role within the Washington establishment. Benz emphasized the Democratic Party’s desperation to find a suitable successor due to Biden’s inability to win the next election, pointing out the lack of candidates with the necessary foreign policy and intelligence experience. He highlighted Hunter Biden’s increasing involvement in White House affairs, contradicting previous claims of no business discussions between Joe and Hunter Biden, and suggested Hunter’s involvement stems from his deep ties to national security and international business. Benz expressed surprise at the intelligence community’s silence on Biden’s health issues, given their potential national security implications. He also mentioned key figures like Kamala Harris and Mike Donilon, noting their potential roles in maintaining continuity in the Democratic leadership, and highlighted BlackRock’s influence through figures like Tom Donilon. Additionally, Benz described USAID as a front for CIA operations, detailing its involvement in international interventions and suggesting it plays a significant role in the current immigration crisis. He noted Samantha Power’s influence in USAID and her husband’s new position at the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting their involvement in shaping immigration policies. Overall, Benz depicted a deeply interconnected political and intelligence establishment maneuvering strategically in response to Biden’s limitations.

EJ Antoni and Dave Brat discussed the negative impact of the Biden administration’s economic policies, highlighting the contrast with the Trump era. Antoni pointed out that Trump’s administration fostered free-flowing capital markets, making it easier for the government and private sectors to obtain financing. In contrast, the current administration has eroded confidence in the U.S. dollar, leading to its devaluation and higher interest rates on various loans due to reckless spending by the radical left. They argued that Biden is merely a figurehead with a real economic agenda driven by more radical elements. The discussion emphasized the significant loss in purchasing power affecting all aspects of life, including retirement savings, and the increased financial strain on retirees. Antoni also criticized inflation statistics as misleading, suggesting they understate the real economic pain. The conversation concluded with a call for hedging investments and recognizing that the current economic situation is unsustainable, urging a return to policies that ensure prosperity and financial stability.  In a discussion on the War Room, Dave Brat and Liz Harrington delved into the current political state, emphasizing a constitutional crisis since November 3, 2020, due to Joe Biden’s ineffectiveness as a commander-in-chief. Harrington criticized Biden as a mere figurehead, suggesting the country is run by unaccountable elites manipulating the media and government through intelligence agencies. She highlighted the influence of globalists and elite figures controlling national and global policies, asserting that Trump, independent and accountable only to the American people, disrupts this power structure. Harrington expressed hope for Trump’s return to restoring a robust executive and dismantling corruption, citing some favorable Supreme Court rulings as a sign of resilience. She underscored the necessity of re-electing Trump to revive constitutional governance and hinted at internal power dynamics within the Biden family, suggesting Jill Biden’s struggle to maintain control. Harrington concluded by sharing her social media handles, encouraging followers to stay updated on her advocacy for the War Room’s message.  In their conversation, Dave Brat and Mike Howell from the Heritage Foundation discuss the critical issues facing the United States, mainly focusing on border security and its implications for elections. Howell highlights Heritage’s extensive research exposing vulnerabilities in the electoral system due to illegal aliens being registered to vote. He emphasizes the alarming potential impact on elections, citing findings from North Carolina as indicative of a larger threat nationwide. Heritage’s efforts include legal challenges against NGOs facilitating illegal activities and advocating for legislative measures to prevent non-citizens from voting. They criticize the Biden administration for its perceived laxity on border control, accusing it of potentially exploiting illegal votes for electoral advantage. Howell stresses Heritage’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting election integrity against what they perceive as systemic vulnerabilities exacerbated by immigration policies. Their discussion underscores deep concerns about national security and the integrity of American elections amidst ongoing political turmoil and legislative battles.  In a recent War Room discussion, Bradley Thayer and Dave Brat highlighted America’s vulnerabilities amid President Biden’s perceived leadership failures. Thayer pointed to China’s aggressive geopolitical moves under Xi Jinping, including alliances and pressure on regional allies like Taiwan and the Philippines. Brat criticized bipartisan support for engaging with China, arguing it undermines U.S. sovereignty. Both stressed the need to shift from corporate interests benefiting China to bolstering U.S. security and independence. Their analysis underscored the urgent call for a strategic reorientation to confront external threats and internal divisions, advocating for policies that prioritize America’s long-term national interests.  Judge Gableman criticized Wisconsin’s State Supreme Court, controlled by leftist Democrats, for legalizing unsupervised dropboxes, overturning a previous ruling. He argued this decision compromises election security and undermines public confidence in the judiciary. Gableman highlighted the absurdity of the majority’s reasoning, where any municipal clerk, despite potential fraud risks, can collect ballots under the guise of being a “person.” He emphasized the ruling’s potential to facilitate fraud and accused justices of prioritizing politics over judicial integrity. The discussion underscored concerns about electoral fairness and judicial impartiality in Wisconsin.  Natalie Winters talked about an article she wrote about the War Games for Droughts and Blackouts.  Noor Bid Laden discussed how the Biden administration’s leadership flaws have damaged America’s image abroad, portraying it as ungovernable and chaotic. She criticized Biden’s alleged incompetence, claiming he was propped up by Democrat mega-donors rather than chosen by voters. She cited a tweet by David Sachs highlighting conspiracy theories now acknowledged as true, suggesting a deliberate effort to discredit the U.S. globally. Bid Laden argued that these tactics aim to undermine American sovereignty in favor of a centralized globalist agenda. She urged a return to America First policies to restore independence and counteract these globalist influences.  Speaking on the War Room podcast, Darren Beattie discussed the current turmoil within the Democratic Party regarding President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. He highlighted the media’s role in downplaying concerns over Biden’s health despite growing speculation and internal Democratic disarray. Beattie pointed out that the media’s previous gaslighting of Biden’s health now complicates efforts to remove him, as it would be seen as admitting their complicity. He emphasized Kamala Harris’s conspicuous silence regarding her proximity to the January 6th events, suggesting it contradicts the narrative pushed by Democrats about the seriousness of that day. Beattie speculated that Democrats, despite internal dissent and media scrutiny, may not replace Biden due to fears of electoral repercussions and a lack of viable alternatives within their ranks. He urged continued scrutiny on these issues, particularly Kamala Harris’s role and the media’s credibility in shaping public perception.  Libby Emmons discussed the recent decision by Judge LaShia Miles to withhold the manifesto of Audrey Hale, the transgender Covenant School shooter. The judge cited copyright concerns, granting rights to the victims’ families, and feared that releasing the manifesto could inspire copycat crimes. Michael Patrick Leahy of the Tennessee Star attempted to obtain these documents, even facing contempt charges for protecting his sources. Emmons highlighted that Hale admired the Columbine shooters and had unreported homicidal ideations during therapy. Emmons criticized the media’s response, noting the immediate focus on trans rights following the shooting rather than addressing the incident’s gravity. She argued that leftist media often spins narratives to vilify conservatives, Trump supporters, and the MAGA movement. Emmons pointed out the media’s bias in handling such events, suggesting a double standard when it comes to anti-trans or conservative-related violence. She emphasized the importance of critical thinking and maintaining personal values amidst pervasive media bias, urging vigilance against misinformation. Emmons underscored that America’s future depends on citizens who can discern the truth, advocating for clear-headedness and resistance against media-driven falsehoods. She can be followed on Twitter and through her work at The Post Millennial and Human Events.  Jeffrey Tucker, president of the Brownstone Institute, criticizes the latest economic data, particularly the June jobs report, highlighting discrepancies and inaccuracies. He notes that the reported 206,000 non-farm payroll jobs include significant revisions and an increase in government and healthcare jobs, while sectors like leisure and hospitality lag. Tucker argues that the official unemployment rate, currently at 4.1%, underestimates real unemployment, which he suggests could be closer to 8% when considering those who have left the workforce. Tucker is skeptical of the official inflation data, believing it severely underreports the true rate of inflation. He cites personal examples, such as a 70% increase in the price of paper towels over 16 months, and a 100% rise in olive oil prices within a year, to illustrate his point. He argues that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excludes many relevant costs like taxes, insurance, and new fees, leading to an inaccurate representation of inflation. According to Tucker, real inflation could be between 35% and 50% over the last few years. He also criticizes the reporting of GDP, claiming that nominal GDP growth is misleading due to government spending. Adjusted for a more realistic inflation rate, Tucker believes the U.S. GDP has contracted significantly, indicating a recession or even a depression. Tucker blames both outdated data collection methods and intentional obfuscation by government agencies for these inaccuracies. He suggests that the Biden administration might be manipulating economic data to present a more favorable picture ahead of elections.

Jerry Dunleavy, a former senior investigator on the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Afghanistan investigation, resigned in frustration over what he describes as an ineffective and unserious probe. Initially an investigative reporter covering the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, Dunleavy joined the committee to seek accountability. However, he found that witnesses were treated too gently, key figures were never called, and crucial questions were left unanswered. Dunleavy criticized Chairman McCaul for not fulfilling promises to thoroughly investigate the events, particularly regarding the bombing at Kabul Airport. He expressed deep concern that future military failures could lead to more unnecessary casualties without proper accountability. Dunleavy emphasized, “Inaction is really non-excusable,” especially when there’s power to compel testimony and documents. He hopes that public pressure might push the committee to fulfill its responsibilities.  Theo Wold argues that the recent surge in naturalization efforts is a strategic move by the left to reshape the electorate before the 2024 election. He points out that naturalization trends have declined over the last few decades. Still, recent efforts by the Biden administration are expediting the process to ensure new citizens can vote. Wold highlights the administrative state’s role in pushing policies they favor while dragging their feet on those they oppose, stating, "If it’s an idea they like, they’ll move expeditiously.” He warns that this selective efficiency could significantly impact the upcoming election, emphasizing the need for more robust policies to counteract these efforts.  Natalie Winters gave some of her thoughts and ideas on what the Deep State is doing.  In response to his ministry being entangled in legal battles initiated by Democrats just before their convention in Chicago, Mike Lindell is offering his book for free. The book details his journey to sobriety from crack addiction and the development of his ministry, which Democrats are now pushing to shut down.  Congressman Tim Burchett told the WarRoom that he has been actively working to address concerns about Tulsi Gabbard being placed on a “Quiet Skies” watch list, which has led to her being followed by agents through airports. Burchett finds this surveillance alarming and is demanding answers, emphasizing that if it can happen to her, it could happen to others. He criticizes unelected bureaucrats for overreaching and violating constitutional rights, likening the situation to other government abuses, such as labeling concerned parents and peaceful protesters as domestic terrorists. Burchett expresses frustration with the lack of accountability in Washington, blaming a system influenced by lobbyists and entrenched bureaucrats. He calls for a stronger push against wasteful spending and government overreach, criticizing both Democrats and moderate Republicans for their roles in allowing these issues to persist. Burchett also supports cutting bureaucratic staff in Washington by 75% and advocates for electing leaders like Matt Gaetz, who he believes stand firm against corruption. He warns that if these issues aren’t addressed, the country risks losing its freedoms and facing further bureaucratic abuses.  Dr. Robert Malone, in a discussion, expressed his views on the political dynamics surrounding Donald Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Malone suggests that Fauci, despite being lobbed softballs by CNN to paint Trump as a threat of political retaliation, did not take the bait. Instead, Fauci’s comments implied he does not expect a Trump administration to engage in political vendettas, unlike what Malone perceives as the approach taken by the Biden-Harris administration. Malone criticizes Fauci’s past actions and statements but notes a surprising neutrality in Fauci’s anticipation of Trump’s potential actions if re-elected. Malone interprets this as Trump focusing on broader issues rather than political revenge, despite ample reasons for accountability due to alleged lies to Congress by Fauci and his subordinates. Malone personally would favor seeing accountability but acknowledges the more pressing need for Trump to address larger national problems. He also mentions his upcoming speaking engagement at the Liberty Forum in Silicon Valley, where he plans to discuss topics like weaponized fear and psychological bio-terrorism. Malone’s analysis reflects a complex interplay of political expectations and personal convictions regarding justice and governance priorities.  Father Calvin Robinson and Lawrence Fox shared their views on the state of politics and society in the UK during their appearance on War Room. Robinson, who was blocked from ordination in the Church of England due to his “biblical views on gender and sexuality,” expressed concerns about the lack of representation for the working-class in Britain. He appreciated Elon Musk’s recent comments about civil unrest, stating, “Thank goodness we have an ally,” highlighting the establishment’s disconnect from ordinary citizens. Fox, head of the Reclaim Party, echoed these sentiments, criticizing the current political landscape: “We have a uni-party because we have a two-party system.” He lamented the lack of true opposition to what he described as a “far-left government” and warned that the British people lack a political voice, leading to potential unrest. Both Robinson and Fox agreed that the UK’s two-tiered system is deeply problematic, with Robinson emphasizing that “we live in a two-tier society,” where people from certain demographics face harsher consequences for minor infractions while others commit serious crimes with impunity. They concluded that people power might be the only solution to the deep-seated issues facing the nation, with Fox predicting that future protests could see “a million” people marching, forcing the government to take notice.  Todd Bensman, reporting from Panama’s Darien Gap, highlights the region’s critical role as a migration bottleneck where over 1.5 million migrants, including individuals from Muslim-majority countries, Africa, and China, pass through on their way to the U.S. border. Bensman underscores the national security threat posed by this route, noting that Panama has recently captured several terrorists among the migrants. Despite Panama’s new president, Raul Molino, vowing to close the Darien Gap and deport migrants instead of releasing them, he faces challenges due to the lack of promised support from the U.S. “Where are the Americans? They’re gone. You promised us aid and assistance, and there’s nothing going on with that,” Bensman quotes Molino. This failure to act, Bensman argues, is a missed opportunity to enhance U.S. national security. He also criticizes the U.S. diplomatic approach, emphasizing the need for stronger measures, such as sanctions or visa restrictions, to incentivize cooperation from transit countries like Colombia. Bensman warns that the migration crisis will continue to escalate without decisive action.  Billboard Chris Elston criticized the controversial practice of drag queen story hours for young children. He argued, “They’re trying to recruit little kids into the cult of gender into queer Theory,” calling it a misguided effort to normalize gender transitions among children. He highlighted the alarming statistics on gender dysphoria treatments, noting, “More than 300,000 children aged 12 to 17 have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria,” and criticized the trend of performing surgeries on minors, including “6,000 double mastectomies” in recent years. Elston also stressed that this issue resonates strongly with voters. “The loudest cheers at Trump’s CPAC speech came when he vowed to stop the chemical castration of children,” he said, indicating widespread public concern. He believes that action from all branches of government is necessary, urging legislative and judicial interventions to halt what he describes as “child abuse.” Elston presents a stark call to action, emphasizing the urgent need for both effective border management and protective measures against the sexualization of children. “Parents need to put their foot down,” Chris concludes, underscoring the critical nature of these issues in shaping the future of U.S. policy.

Julie Kelly discussed potential cover-ups involving missing Secret Service text messages from January 5th and 6th, 2021. She highlighted that these messages, belonging to at least 24 Secret Service officials, including key personnel like the director and Kimberly Cheatle, were deleted, raising concerns about obstruction of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General, Joseph Cuffari. Kelly pointed out that DHS attempted to prevent Cuffari from accessing related emails and other correspondence and even sought to redact portions of the report before it was released to Congress and the public. She emphasized the broader implications of this cover-up, suggesting it reflects a “systemic” effort to withhold critical information from the public. Kelly also noted that despite being labeled as conspiracy theorists, those questioning the official narrative have been vindicated as more information comes to light. She concluded by mentioning the developing scandal, including recent concerns raised by Senator Charles Grassley about DHS’s handling of the investigation into the alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13th. Kelly described these events as part of a larger interagency cover-up, including the ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden and related political figures.  Natalie Winters outlined her reasoning for resisting party unity with Republicans before the November election. They discussed her negative feelings about them and why she is frustrated.  Theo Wold criticized the Democrats’ newly codified platform as radically transformative, particularly concerning immigration policies. He highlighted that the platform endorses the Citizenship Act, which proposes to legalize 15.5 million undocumented immigrants who entered unlawfully under President Biden. The Act also offers these individuals free housing, healthcare, and legal representation and introduces the term “prospective lawful immigrant” to replace “illegal alien,” thereby eliminating distinctions between citizens and foreign nationals. Wold argued that the Act would also expedite green card eligibility for illegal immigrants, even those with criminal records, and shockingly, use taxpayer money to bring deported individuals back to the U.S. for citizenship. He described the platform as a fundamental, anti-American transformation, blending Marxist, feminist, queer theory, and open borders policies to erase distinctions between American citizens and foreign nationals. Wold questioned whether Republicans have the political will to combat this radical shift and expressed concerns about the feasibility of mass deportations, emphasizing the need for more stringent immigration enforcement and the use of modern tools to discourage illegal immigration. He also criticized former Republicans who now oppose Trump, accusing them of supporting this radical agenda out of personal animosity.  Mike Benz criticized the Democrats’ platform as fundamentally radical and anti-American, particularly focusing on immigration policies. He emphasized that the platform’s endorsement of the Citizenship Act would legalize millions of undocumented immigrants, offering them free housing, healthcare, and legal representation. Benz noted that the Act eliminates the distinction between citizens and foreign nationals by replacing terms like “illegal alien” with “prospective lawful immigrant.” He argued that this approach effectively dissolves U.S. sovereignty and expedites citizenship for even those with criminal records. Benz also highlighted the platform’s broader agenda, which he described as a mix of Marxist, feminist, and queer theories aiming to erase the difference between tax-paying citizens and foreign nationals. He questioned whether Republicans have the resolve to oppose this shift and criticized former Republicans who now oppose Trump, accusing them of enabling this radical agenda out of personal animosity.  Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell discussed their concerns over Steve Bannon’s treatment by the Bureau of Prisons, alleging that Bannon is being unfairly targeted by Attorney General Merrick Garland’s office. Giuliani emphasized his experience running the Bureau of Prisons, noting that Bannon is being treated differently than other prisoners, with his case seemingly manipulated at higher levels of government. Lindell supported these claims, stressing the importance of alternative media platforms like Frank Speech to counter mainstream narratives. He also promoted his MyPillow products, tying them to the broader effort to support Bannon and the War Room. Lindell shared his experiences of being attacked by various authorities, including the Minnesota Attorney General, who he claimed was targeting his charitable efforts. Both Giuliani and Lindell framed these issues within a broader context of political warfare, emphasizing the importance of resisting what they view as an increasingly authoritarian government.  Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell criticized the handling of a political convention, particularly the late-night timing of a speech, suggesting it was intentionally scheduled to minimize viewership. They speculated that the speaker might harbor resentment for being sidelined, leading to his exclusion from more prominent time slots. Lindell emphasized the importance of alternative media, like Frank Speech, to highlight disillusioned Democrats now supporting Trump, with plans to feature interviews showcasing their reasons for switching allegiance. The conversation also touched on Giuliani’s and Lindell’s concerns about political persecution, referencing Steve Bannon’s imprisonment and the broader implications for free speech and political dissent. They encouraged their audience to stay informed and support efforts to challenge mainstream narratives.

Scott Pressler emphasized the growing struggles for Democrats, pointing out that as voters hear more from Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, their polling worsens. He highlighted that Trump is gaining ground in Pennsylvania, where his organization, Early Vote Action, is heavily focused. “The data is reflecting that the honeymoon is over,” Pressler noted, indicating that even with Democrats sidelining Biden and Harris bringing in Tim Walz, Republicans are still out-registering Democrats across Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. Pressler stressed the importance of economic issues in the upcoming election, stating that voters are increasingly motivated by concerns over the economy, peace, and immigration. He mentioned hearing from voters who have never voted before but are now registering because “life was easier and more affordable four years ago.” He criticized Harris for being ineffective, asking why she hasn’t implemented her proposals during her time in office, and emphasized the need for Republicans to continue highlighting her failures. Pressler also encouraged voters to ensure their voter registration is accurate and to engage with local election boards to prevent any election day issues. He concluded by urging support for his efforts, emphasizing the importance of grassroots action in securing a victory for Trump.  Natalie Winters highlights scenes from the Democratic National Convention, where crowds act radical outside and inside the official gathering.  Mike Benz’s commentary presents a concerning view of the recent developments in Georgia’s election board, framing it within a broader context of potential governmental manipulation and historical parallels. He highlights the involvement of international and domestic intelligence agencies, including DHS and NATO, suggesting that these entities may have played roles in orchestrating events that undermine democratic processes. Benz draws connections between the recent NATO summit and historical instances of false flag operations, particularly a 1962 proposal by U.S. military officials to stage attacks on American soil as a pretext for war with Cuba. He argues that similar tactics might be in play today, with government agencies possibly manipulating events to influence political outcomes. Benz also raises the issue of how specific individuals, like Thomas Crooks, could be manipulated by intelligence agencies to carry out violent acts, which are then used to justify broader government actions. He links these concerns to the handling of the 2020 election and the role of BLM protests, suggesting that these were part of a coordinated effort involving intelligence networks. The commentary paints a picture of a deeply entrenched system where domestic and international intelligence operations intersect, potentially threatening the integrity of democratic processes. Benz warns that these patterns, if left unchecked, could further erode public trust in government institutions.  Allum Bokhari discusses the growing divide within Silicon Valley regarding free speech and censorship. He highlights how some figures, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, have taken a strong stance against censorship, especially in opposition to the U.S. Deep State’s influence on tech companies. However, Bokhari points out that major players like Google and Microsoft remain deeply entrenched in the censorship regime. He notes that these companies have not shifted their policies since the 2020 election and continue to support the censorship complex, as evidenced by their involvement in initiatives like psychological inoculation and media blacklisting through entities like NewsGuard. Bokhari argues that while some parts of Silicon Valley are resisting censorship, the industry as a whole remains divided, with significant portions still aligned with establishment interests.  Mike Lindell meets Harry Sisson at the DNC, and they troll each other. Hilarity ensues.  Mike Lindell joins Rudy Giuliani and Dr. Maria Ryan at the DNC to discuss the state of politics, including what happened at the DNC. Lindell jumps in and out from another location to talk about his appearance at the Democratic convention without his noteworthy mustache.

Natalie Winters talked about her feelings about the Democrat National Convention.  Darren Beattie commented on the Democratic National Convention, noting its lack of substantive content but acknowledging its effectiveness in appealing to average, low-information voters. He argued that the convention “struck all the right notes” with a tone that appeared inviting and well-received by the public. Beattie highlighted that speeches, particularly those by Obama and Kamala Harris, were designed to resonate positively with viewers, focusing on emotional appeal rather than policy depth. Beattie also pointed out the strategic advantage Democrats gained from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s departure from the race and his implied support for Trump. This shift forces anti-woke centrists, who previously saw Kennedy as a viable alternative, to reconsider their position. According to Beattie, this scenario complicates the Democrats’ efforts, creating “a whole other headache” by expanding the battleground to multiple fronts, which could diminish the impact of any short-term boost from the convention.  Josh Hammer talked about his reaction to the Democrat National Convention.  Natalie Winters gave some of her thoughts and ideas about the important activism that is being done by the WarRoom audience for the coming elections, building up to November and beyond.  Natalie Winters analyzed the Democrats’ election strategy for November and how she thinks they will get Democrats elected.  Nataline Winters talked about her analysis of the Democrat’s playbook and predicted that they would accuse Republicans of stealing the election.

Darren Beattie discusses the arrest of Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, highlighting it as a significant development in the ongoing struggle between free speech advocates and state censorship. Beattie argues that Durov’s arrest on charges such as distributing child pornography and drug trafficking is essentially punitive, aimed at pressuring him to comply with state demands for censorship and information. He sees this as part of a broader escalation by states unable to censor platforms traditionally, moving towards criminalizing speech they oppose. Beattie notes that this trend is also reflected in the U.S., citing the felony charge against Douglas Mackey as another example. He emphasizes the geopolitical implications, particularly with Durov’s efforts to maintain a neutral, privacy-focused platform, suggesting that this has drawn ire from multiple intelligence agencies worldwide. Beattie concludes that the arrest marks a dangerous new phase in the global “censorship wars,” with significant consequences for free speech and geopolitical neutrality.  Robert Malone discusses his political journey, stating he has friends across various political camps, including centrist libertarians and those linked to both Trump and Kennedy. Initially involved in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign, Malone distanced himself after disagreeing with some of Kennedy’s policies. Over time, he became convinced that Trump’s positions align more closely with his own views, particularly regarding free speech and the Second Amendment. He supports Trump unequivocally, believing that Trump’s leadership is essential for America’s future. Additionally, Malone criticizes the updated COVID-19 vaccines, citing insufficient data and potential risks like myocarditis. He argues that regulatory processes are being bypassed and emphasizes the importance of scientific rigor. He also mentions his book, which aims to educate readers on media manipulation and technological tactics used against the public, promoting resilience against such strategies.  Mike Benz discussed how the encrypted messaging app Telegram is used by the U.S. government for international diplomacy and covert operations. He highlighted its role in the 2020 Belarus protests, supported by the U.S. State Department and CIA, to evade state surveillance. Benz also mentioned the U.S. interest in using Telegram to support dissidents in Russia, citing U.S. NGOs’ condemnation when Russia considered banning Telegram in 2018. He suggested that the U.S. attempts to gain access to Telegram’s backend, including efforts to recruit Telegram’s chief engineer. Benz believes Telegram is vital for U.S. intelligence, enabling them to gather information and coordinate activities without leaving federal fingerprints. He implied the recent arrest of Telegram’s founder in France may have been coordinated with the U.S. due to its strategic importance, especially for monitoring Russian communications and propaganda.  Natalie Winters talked about the lack of appropriate behavior by the Biden/Harris administration toward the tragic deaths of 13 members in the Afghanistan withdrawal,  representing the disastrous policies in general by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.  In their discussion, Joe Allen and Noor Bin Laden express concerns about the transhumanist movement and its implications for individual freedom, highlighting fears of a “collectivist hive mind.” Noor criticizes Elon Musk’s role in advancing technological convergence and his influence on social media, suggesting platforms like X are tools for psychological manipulation. The conversation shifts to a recent World Economic Forum report identifying four global risks in the post-pandemic era: a decline in American dominance, political legitimacy crises, an international mental health crisis, and potential cyber threats. Noor argues that these risks are part of a broader agenda for global control, emphasizing the need for vigilance against misinformation and manipulation. Joe concludes by advising resistance to fear and compliance, urging people to stay informed and retain their humanity amidst these challenges.   In a conversation with Joe Allen, Tim Hinchcliffe discussed a declassified document from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The document reveals that the intelligence community seeks cost-effective methods to acquire publicly and commercially available data, bypassing traditional legal constraints like obtaining warrants. Hinchcliffe explained that this practice, normalized over time, allows government and private entities to access and use personal data extensively. He highlighted how smartphones and other digital devices make tracking individuals easier, which raises privacy concerns. Hinchcliffe’s article on this topic, titled “The U.S. Spy Community is Looking for Cheaper, Quicker Ways to Access and Buy Your Data,” is available on his website, Sociable.co. The discussion emphasizes the increasing ease with which personal information is collected and the importance of awareness and potential resistance to such data practices.

Michael Knowles criticizes Democratic policies, particularly those of Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, regarding transgender issues and education. Knowles argues that Walz’s actions, like promoting tampons in boys’ bathrooms and making Minnesota a sanctuary for trans kids, are abnormal and push inappropriate sexual topics onto children. He contrasts this with Republican values, highlighting that while Democrats are accused of wanting to ban books like the Bible, Republicans aim to remove explicit material from schools. Knowles also comments on political censorship and media bias, noting how social media platforms were pressured to suppress conservative voices and stories like Hunter Biden’s laptop. Additionally, he critiques Kamala Harris for changing debate rules to favor herself, portraying her actions as manipulative. Overall, Knowles positions himself and conservatives as defenders of traditional values against what he sees as the extreme and hypocritical policies of the left.  Mike Davis argues that the legal actions against former President Trump, led by special counsel Jack Smith, are politically motivated attempts to interfere in the upcoming 2024 election. He compares Trump’s repeated legal battles to a "Freddy Krueger” scenario, where Trump keeps coming back despite continuous attacks. Davis criticizes the use of obstruction charges, which he claims were previously deemed inappropriate by the Supreme Court. He suggests that Smith’s strategy is to push for a quick ruling on presidential immunity, aiming to damage Trump’s election campaign. Davis also accuses the Biden administration of allowing China to exploit trade agreements, hurting American manufacturing and jobs. He expresses concerns about the lack of action against Chinese economic practices and believes that, if elected, Trump would implement strong trade policies to protect American industries and national security.  Natalie Winters shared the reasoning for her “loom and doom” over the future and her deep dislike of Republicans. She also talked about her negativity toward Republicans being in government. Part One:  Part Two:  Joanna Miller discusses the economic downturn, highlighting significant issues in the agriculture sector, such as the closure of Tyson Foods’ largest poultry processing facility in Virginia, which resulted in 700 layoffs. She notes that agricultural production, particularly in pork, is declining, reflecting a broader recession marked by decreased economic activity. Miller criticizes Kamala Harris for failing to support American industries, contrasting her with Donald Trump, whom she credits with revitalizing the industrial base through tariffs and promoting domestic investment in manufacturing, including steel production. She emphasizes that Trump’s policies helped prevent inflation and created jobs, asserting that if Trump is re-elected, he will restore these industries. Miller believes Trump’s leadership understands the importance of a robust industrial base for economic and national security and vows to reverse the trend of companies moving abroad by reinforcing the American manufacturing sector.  Jeff Clark discusses a new indictment against former President Trump, suggesting it is part of ongoing efforts to pursue Trump legally. He mentions that a new grand jury was used for this indictment, possibly to avoid issues with previous evidence that could violate a July 1st decision regarding Trump’s immunity and evidence exclusion rules. This new approach likely ensures any previously excluded evidence does not compromise the indictment. Clark implies that these legal actions are part of a broader strategy to interfere with the upcoming election, noting that the indictment’s timing coincides with the peak of the campaign season and an upcoming debate. He describes the indictment as a modified version of earlier charges, possibly adjusted to avoid legal challenges related to immunity and exclusionary rules that protect actions within the executive branch.  Terry Schilling, President of the American Principles Project, discusses their upcoming summit in Washington, D.C., with Tiffany Justice, President of Moms for Liberty, featuring notable speakers like Rob Schneider and Seth Dillon. The conversation highlights the importance of taking action instead of spreading negativity online. Tiffany introduces a panel of influential speakers, including Tulsi Gabbard and Jennifer Sey, who advocate for children’s rights and against controversial educational policies. They discuss the political landscape, emphasizing the fractures within the Democratic Party over issues like gender transition surgeries and children’s rights. Paula Scanlan, a former college swimmer, shares her experience of being forced to undress in front of a transgender teammate, describing the coercion and lack of support from authorities. The conversation critiques policies allowing men in women’s spaces, arguing that they endanger women and girls and undermine common-sense protections for vulnerable populations. Part One:  In this conversation, participants discussed various political and cultural issues, particularly focusing on President Trump’s leadership style, the influence of RFK Jr., and the pro-life movement. They expressed optimism that Trump’s decision-making process, which involves diverse perspectives, offers hope for reversing current challenges in America. The conversation highlighted the importance of uniting a broad coalition, including disillusioned Democrats, to address issues like abortion, free speech, and gender policies. They also emphasized the need for strategic, culturally aware political actions that align with the public’s sentiments on sensitive topics, like abortion, to achieve long-term goals.

Darren Beattie discusses the intricate dynamics of geopolitics and censorship, highlighting a recent Revolver News piece exploring these complexities. He critiques the Atlantic Council’s DFR Lab as a censorship tool for the U.S. security establishment, accusing it of weaponizing disinformation to justify censorship. Beattie notes its funding from U.S. and British governments and a Ukrainian oligarch, linking its activities to the U.S. government’s interests, especially in relation to Ukraine. He suggests that Telegram is targeted by the Atlantic Council due to its role in disseminating uncensored information from conflict zones like Ukraine. Beattie also touches on a broader shift among tech elites, with figures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg aligning with MAGA, driven by both conviction and a need to protect business interests in a polarized environment. He argues that neutrality in the current geopolitical climate is increasingly difficult, as exemplified by Telegram’s Durov.  Mike Howell criticizes the handling of investigations by special counsels, particularly focusing on the disparity between the treatment of Donald Trump and Joe and Hunter Biden. He argues that the investigation into Trump, led by Jack Smith, has been excessive and politically motivated, with expenditures significantly higher than those for the Biden investigations. Howell contends that Trump’s case is straightforward, as he had the authority to declassify documents, unlike the Bidens, whose actions with classified materials span decades and involve corrupt interests. He criticizes special counsel Robert Hur’s investigation into Joe Biden as inadequate, merely cataloging the locations of documents rather than probing potential misuse for personal gain. Howell sees this as an example of election interference and a biased judicial process. Additionally, he highlights efforts by the left to manipulate the electoral process, contrasting them with the right’s reaction to Biden’s campaign strategies and the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) handling of nominations.  Natalie Winters talked about her general dislike of Republicans and her anger toward them as a group. She questioned why they waited for Subpoena Judge Merchan’s daughter to investigate her financial ties to charges and cases brought against President Trump.  Phillip Patrick critiques a proposed economic policy involving price controls and tax credits, arguing that these measures will have negative long-term effects. He points out that the administration’s proposed tax credits—$6,000 for newborns and $3,600 for existing children—are not feasible because the federal government lacks the funds to support them. Implementing these policies could devalue the dollar and increase inflation. Patrick suggests that, although such measures might be worth debating if the government had the necessary resources, they are currently unrealistic and would likely exacerbate economic problems rather than resolve them.   Dr. Allen Mendenhall discusses the economic principle of supply and demand, particularly in the context of natural disasters in Alabama, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. He explains that higher prices during shortages signal suppliers to increase production or reallocate resources, helping to alleviate the shortage. Mendenhall emphasizes that increasing prices prevents resources from being depleted by ensuring they are allocated to those who need them most rather than those who value them less. He argues this mechanism is crucial, especially when essential services like ambulances need fuel. Mendenhall warns against setting price controls, stating that they can be counterproductive by disincentivizing new market entrants and innovations, ultimately keeping prices high. He critiques Kamala Harris’s economic platform for including price controls, suggesting that such policies misunderstand basic financial principles and can adversely affect supply and demand.  In a discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and U.S. Representative Tim Burchett (R-TN), concerns were raised about Democratic Vice Presidential pick Tim Waltz’s extensive connections to China. Burchett criticized Waltz’s frequent travels to China, citing over 30 visits since 1989 and suggesting potential undue influence from the Chinese Communist Party. He emphasized the need for transparency, stating, “Anyone who’s gone to China 30 times…wouldn’t be coming back if he at least didn’t get the approval of the Chinese Communist Party.” Burchett also voiced worries about the media’s lack of scrutiny on Waltz and potential threats to U.S. security, hinting at a broader conspiracy involving U.S. institutions. He stressed the importance of public vigilance, civility and action to prevent the perceived erosion of American values and sovereignty.  Dr. Derrek Harvey, Dr. Bradley Thayer, and Retired Captain James Farnell examined strategic developments in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. Harvey highlighted Iran’s continued aggression against Israel, facilitated by proxies like Hezbollah, aiming to wear down Israel’s economy and isolate it internationally. He criticized the U.S. administration for its perceived lack of support for Israel and leniency towards Iran, which he argues emboldens Iran’s efforts. Farnell then shifted the focus to the Indo-Pacific, noting the absence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the region for the first time in over two decades, as China aggressively challenges U.S. allies, including the Philippines and Japan. He expressed concern over the U.S. response, describing it as a signal of diminishing American commitment in the region, which could encourage further Chinese assertiveness. Both experts emphasized the need for stronger U.S. actions to uphold its commitments and deter adversaries in these critical regions. Part One:  Part Two:

In her recent discussion, Cortney Turner highlighted key insights from her interview with Richard Poe and emphasized the enduring influence of the Fabian Society. Turner noted that the Fabian Society, founded in 1884, epitomizes dialectical warfare tactics. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolizes their incremental approach to subversion—gradually infiltrating and altering societies without direct confrontation. Turner explained that the Fabians’ tactics align with the dialectical tensions currently shaping political and social unrest. She pointed out that the Fabian Society, through its incremental strategy, has played a central role in creating and perpetuating these tensions. This approach, rooted in the ideas of gradual change rather than abrupt revolution, reflects in contemporary issues including educational subversion and cultural shifts. Turner also linked these tactics to broader conspiracies involving organizations like Lucis Trust and the Theosophical Society, illustrating a convergence of political and spiritual agendas aimed at societal manipulation. She urged listeners to understand these dynamics as part of a long-standing strategy of cultural and political subversion, encapsulated in her upcoming Cognitive Liberty Conference. In a recent analysis, Darren Beattie criticized the selection of Tim Walz as Vice President for Kamala Harris, suggesting it marks the end of Harris’s brief popularity surge. Beattie noted, “We had Peak Kamala,” and criticized her for bypassing other potential candidates like the astronaut from Arizona and Josh Shapiro. He argued that choosing Shapiro might have strategically benefited Harris by showing a less radical image to mainstream voters. Instead, he describes Walz as the "George Floyd riot guy,” pointing to his involvement in controversial issues like redefining pedophilia as a sexual orientation and promoting tampons in boys’ bathrooms. Beattie claims this choice reflects poorly on Harris’s decision-making and highlights her vulnerability to far-left pressures. He further comments on Boeing’s failures, emphasizing a broader decline in competency within U.S. institutions, notably the space program, contrasting it with past achievements.  Peter Bergegger argues that election practices favoring Democrats amount to “legalized fraud.” He criticizes the “Zucker Buck” approach, where Democrats target specific areas through nonprofit organizations, often tax-exempt, to boost voter turnout. He accuses these groups of bribing voters, particularly through initiatives led by Michelle Obama, like “Party at the Polls” and “Pizza to the Polls,” where food and entertainment are provided to encourage voting. Bergegger claims, "You cannot give even one single dollar of any type of incentive,” suggesting these practices violate federal law. He notes that lawsuits have been filed against Michelle Obama, accusing her of orchestrating voter bribery, with operations across 516 U.S. locations. Additionally, Bergegger highlights how organizations like ActBlue allegedly use “smurfing” to launder large donations into small contributions, thus circumventing campaign finance laws. He describes this as using elderly citizens’ information to funnel money through bots, claiming, "The bad guys are doing it through the box system of ActBlue.” Bergegger also criticizes the Republican National Committee for failing to address these issues, stating their primary goal is fundraising rather than winning elections. His investigations have led to complaints against various political figures, emphasizing the scale of alleged fraud.  Natalie Winters commented on the administrative state and how members who are supporting Kamala Harris, as Republicans, admit to favoring their job with the establishment over the mandate given to President Trump by the voters for America First policies.  Winters reacted to a cold open from MSNBC.  Natalie talked about her discovery that MN Governor Tim Wallz, the VP pick to run with Kamala Harris, is tied to a group that she says has ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  Josh Hammer, in his podcast “America on Trial with Josh Hammer,” delves into the recent antitrust ruling against Google, which he views as a landmark moment. The case, initiated during the Trump administration and continued under Biden, saw Google being scrutinized for its monopolistic practices. Hammer highlights that the ruling, issued by Judge Mehta, determined Google’s search and advertising functions constitute illegal monopolies under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. He notes, “This is the federal government’s first major win in an antitrust case in literally 20 to 25 years,” underscoring its significance. Hammer appreciates the bipartisan effort behind the case, noting the unusual continuation of the lawsuit across different administrations. He emphasizes the case’s impact on American public consciousness and the potential for major changes in how Google operates. While the specific remedies are still undecided, Hammer is optimistic about the potential for significant reforms. He also reflects on the broader implications for tech giants and public sovereignty, suggesting that the case might open the door for new players to challenge established tech monopolies.  Recent violence in the UK, sparked by the murder of three young girls, has led to significant social upheaval. The attacker, initially misidentified as an immigrant, was later revealed to be a UK-born individual of Rwandan descent. This revelation intensified tensions and ignited widespread riots across the country. Rick Munn, reporting from Ireland, highlighted the chaos following the incident. "The violence was ignited after a vigil for the victims turned chaotic, with reports of escalating unrest across the UK.” Munn emphasized the critical role of misinformation and its impact on public sentiment. The British government has responded with a robust crackdown. Munn reported on recent measures: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed clear support for the police, promising increased security and criminal justice efforts.” Munn also noted that there is a strong emphasis on addressing violence both online and offline, with early arrests and swift legal action. However, Munn raised concerns about potential biases in the justice system. He remarked, "The contrast in how the justice system handles different groups is evident. There’s criticism over perceived ‘two-tier’ policing, where some groups face more severe scrutiny than others.” The situation remains tense, with ongoing debates about immigration policies and community integration adding to the volatility. Munn observed, "In both Ireland and the UK, local communities are feeling the strain of increased migrant populations without adequate support or consultation.”  Noor Bin Ladin provided a critical analysis of the ongoing riots in Europe, particularly focusing on the UK. She described the current unrest as part of a long-standing strategy involving “divide and rule” and “problem, reaction, solution.” Bin Ladin argued that these tactics, which have historical roots going back over 200 years, are designed to manipulate societies by creating chaos and then exploiting it to implement pre-determined solutions. According to Bin Ladin, the turmoil is not an organic outcome of mass immigration but a deliberate strategy that has culminated from past destabilizations, particularly the Middle Eastern conflicts. She linked the current European unrest to the actions of past leaders like Obama and Blair, suggesting their policies led to the “floodgates” of migration into Europe, intensifying ethnic tensions. Bin Ladin criticized the response to the riots, noting a trend towards increasing surveillance and restrictions on freedoms. She explained, “They are using something called the strategy of tension by pitting these different groups together… The solutions inevitably lead to a loss of freedoms for the local population.” She emphasized that these measures, including enhanced surveillance and digital IDs, are aimed at controlling and monitoring the population, while the underlying issues and perpetrators of the violence are inadequately addressed.  In her recent discussion, Cortney Turner highlighted key insights from her interview with Richard Poe and emphasized the enduring influence of the Fabian Society. Turner noted that the Fabian Society, founded in 1884, epitomizes dialectical warfare tactics. Their emblem, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, symbolizes their incremental approach to subversion—gradually infiltrating and altering societies without direct confrontation.

Logan Washburn of The Federalist discussed concerns about election misinformation efforts in Michigan, drawing parallels to the 2020 election. He noted that the Center for Tech and Civic Life, linked to Zuckerberg, continues influencing elections, including the 2024 one. In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages citizens to report neighbors for spreading “misinformation,” sparking controversy. The state has established a government email for such reports and launched the “Democracy Ambassadors Program,” ironically promoting neighbor snitching for misinformation in democracy’s name. This approach raises concerns about governmental overreach, potentially suppressing speech by labeling it misinformation. Washburn highlights Attorney General Dana Nessel’s letters threatening legal action against individuals sharing supposed misinformation. One recipient, Carolyn Elic, criticized polling location changes on Facebook and received a legal threat, showcasing the seriousness of these measures. This reflects a broader national trend of combating misinformation, raising questions about free speech and political discourse.  Parker Thayer from Capital Research Center discusses the complex web of dark money influencing left-wing judicial advocacy and political maneuvers. According to Thayer, Demand Justice, a 501(c)(4) dark money group, played a significant role in turning the Supreme Court nomination processes into media circuses, such as during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Thayer states, “Simply because the court has started making rulings that the left does not like, they’re reaching for any weapon they can to attack the Supreme Court.” Demand Justice, originally a project of the 1630 Fund, is linked to Arabella Advisors, a large network directing over a billion dollars annually to leftist causes. Thayer points out the influence of Brian Fallon, former communications director for several high-profile Democrats, who founded Demand Justice and now leads Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. The narrative suggests a strategic manipulation of campaign finance laws, contrasting this with conservative efforts to protect the Supreme Court. While acknowledging some conservative judicial advocacy, Thayer emphasizes the need for continued vigilance against what he perceives as existential threats to the judiciary.  Natalie Winters reacted to a corporate media segment praising Kamala Harris as a Black female boss.  Author Trevor Loudon talked about his past research into the Communist ties of both Kamala Harris and Trevor Loudon.  Mike Lindell talked about his experiences with Democrat Tim Walz. He gave his opinion that Kamala Harris’s choice of him will help President Trump because he is so radical with his policy moves in Minnesota.  Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote praised a recent Georgia election board meeting as a significant step forward for election integrity. Engelbrecht highlighted the bipartisan participation in the meeting, where Republicans and Democrats stood together to address election process concerns. She emphasized the importance of new measures allowing access to ballot images, enabling poll watchers at tabulation centers, and providing election officials with necessary support to ensure transparency. Engelbrecht noted that the citizens of Georgia have been instrumental in pushing for these changes and expressed hope that other states would follow suit. True the Vote is actively working on various initiatives, including verifying voter roll accuracy and conducting voter outreach in long-term care facilities. They aim to engage volunteers nationwide to assist in voter registration and education efforts. Engelbrecht encourages people to get involved through their website, truethevote.org, and participate in training programs to support fair and secure elections.  Liz Harrington emphasized the significance of Georgia’s state election board meeting, where a rule was passed allowing county officials to make reasonable inquiries into election results before certifying them. Despite opposition, this rule prevents undue pressure on officials to certify results without verification. Harrington stressed the need for support from Republican parties for election integrity and accountability.  Maureen Bannon criticized Kamala Harris’s choice of Tim Walz as a VP pick, highlighting Walz’s alleged misconduct. She claimed Walz avoided deployment to Iraq in 2005 by retiring early, leaving his Minnesota National Guard unit without leadership. Bannon also accused Walz of exaggerating his military service, stating he falsely claimed 25 years of service and a higher rank. She argued that his willingness to lie about his service raises questions about his honesty with the American people. Bannon suggested this choice reflects poorly on Democratic strategy, asserting that the MAGA movement should continue to highlight such issues.  Terry Shilling, President of the American Principles Project, criticized Tim Walz for his policies on gender transition for minors, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and abortion. Shilling claims Walz supports radical “child mutilation policies,” allowing minors to undergo “chemical castration” and surgeries for gender transitions. According to Shilling, Walz’s policies enable Minnesota to become a sanctuary for minors seeking gender-affirming care, potentially overriding parental authority. Shilling argues that Walz’s stance on DEI promotes “socialism” and undermines merit-based equality. He criticized Walz’s first executive order as governor to establish a DEI Council, calling it Marxism in disguise. Shilling also targeted Walz’s stance on abortion, alleging that Walz’s legislation allows for abortions up to birth and denying care for babies born during failed abortions. Shilling warns, “If Tim Walz and Kamala Harris become president and vice president, you can expect this not just to stay in the blue states… we will have this going all across the country.”  In discussing his new film, Matthew Taylor highlights its impact by delving into “a very large space of time,” exposing the actions of various political villains, including the intelligence community’s alarming involvement in surveillance activities. Taylor expresses his shock over how “the intelligence apparatus…did the work on behalf of the Clinton campaign,” revealing dangerous misuse of power. Despite these serious revelations, Taylor believes the film offers hope by showing that “they got caught” and were defeated by figures like Kash Patel, emphasizing that government corruption can be overcome. Taylor concludes, “These are very dangerous organizations that have unlimited power…but they can be stopped.” The film is available at warroom.film.

Natalie Winters, Brian Kennedy and Michael Anton discussed critical concerns regarding the integrity of upcoming elections and the broader implications of political and administrative actions. The conversation began with a focus on the weaponization of government and the risks associated with election administration, particularly the potential for interference by foreign entities such as Communist China. Brian Kennedy, a prominent figure from the Committee on the Present Danger: China, expressed his deep concerns about the possibility of election manipulation through mail-in ballots. He argued that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was leveraged to push for mail-in voting, which he believes was a key factor in the alleged electoral theft. Kennedy speculated that Communist China, with its significant intelligence and financial resources, could exploit vulnerabilities in the electoral system by producing fraudulent ballots. He emphasized that the Trump campaign would need an overwhelming number of votes to counteract potential fraud and secure a win in 2024, given the inadequate safeguards against such interference. Michael Anton, a former National Security Council advisor and a member of the Claremont Institute’s faculty, discussed the broader implications of administrative failures and potential malfeasance. He argued that the lax approach to election security and voter verification laws might be a deliberate strategy rather than mere incompetence. Anton suggested that by creating a lax environment for voting, the administration ensures that election fraud becomes easier to execute, with local party figures contributing to the outcome without a centralized directive. He also highlighted the role of the Transition Integrity Project, which, according to him, planned to challenge the legitimacy of a Trump victory through various means, including media manipulation and legal tactics. The conversation also touched on the potentially radical implications of the Biden administration’s policies, with Anton criticizing Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential pick as a signal of confidence in the current system’s ability to secure an advantageous outcome for Democrats, regardless of the public or political response. Both Kennedy and Anton urged their audience to remain vigilant and proactive, emphasizing the importance of grassroots efforts, such as whistleblower programs and increased scrutiny, to prevent election fraud and ensure fair voting processes. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  In a discussion hosted by Lara Logan, filling in for Steve Bannon, Dr. Keith Rose provided insights into the geopolitical developments in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal. Logan emphasized the importance of the First Amendment and highlighted the lack of media coverage on Steve Bannon’s imprisonment. Dr. Rose, with extensive experience in U.S. intelligence, shared significant revelations about Afghanistan, particularly concerning a meeting that occurred a year before the U.S. pullout. This meeting included Chinese military, diplomatic, and intelligence officials with the Afghan Ministry of Defense. Rose disclosed another pivotal meeting shortly before the U.S. withdrawal, involving high-ranking individuals such as CIA Director Burns, Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, Chinese intelligence officials, Iranian Republican Guard Corps, and Pakistani representatives. Rose questioned the presence of these individuals, especially since Haqqani had a bounty on his head and a history of violence against Americans. He noted the peculiar security arrangements, including the use of a tier-one group rather than CIA personnel, and the opaque nature of these discussions. Dr. Rose highlighted the consequences of these meetings in the current geopolitical landscape, stating, “The Afghans have the ability through their passport office to create biometric passports and when people come to Afghanistan to train, they will then kid documentation that will allow them to travel.” He warned that the collaboration between the Taliban and China has led to significant Chinese influence in Afghanistan, affecting military, security, and intelligence sectors. This partnership is a concern for U.S. security, especially with the Taliban reportedly training thousands of jihadis and the potential for these individuals to infiltrate the U.S. through established networks. The discussion underscored the strategic expansion of China in Afghanistan and its implications for U.S. national security and global influence.   Ammon Blair, a former intelligence analyst and Texas Public Policy Foundation fellow, has raised alarms about the escalating relationship between Venezuelan cartels and the Chinese government. According to Blair, this collaboration poses a substantial threat to U.S. national security and has exploited weaknesses in the current administration’s border policies. Blair traces the origins of this alliance back to Hugo Chavez’s strategic partnership with Iran and Cuba in the late 1990s. This network has since expanded to include Russia and China, making Venezuela a central hub in a broader asymmetrical warfare strategy against the United States. “If Americans think that…our adversaries have been sitting back just…allowing America to destroy itself, they haven’t been capitalizing on it,” Blair asserted, emphasizing that this is a coordinated effort involving several hostile parties. The numbers reveal a troubling trend. In 2017, there were only 2,600 Venezuelan apprehensions at the U.S. border. By 2023, that number surged to 334,000, indicating a dramatic increase in migration due to Venezuela’s internal collapse under Maduro’s regime. While many Venezuelans are fleeing genuine crises, Blair warns that the Venezuelan government has deliberately emptied prisons, releasing criminal elements to infiltrate the United States. Blair explained how these released individuals form a transnational criminal organization, benefiting from U.S. policies on open borders. He described it as “political theater” by the Venezuelan government, as they position cartel leaders for global influence rather than meaningful reform. “The Mexican cartel has really already built a Silk Road for them,” Blair noted, highlighting how this infrastructure is used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to support their operations in the United States. The link between Venezuelan and Mexican cartels, especially the violent CJNG cartel, creates a direct threat to American communities, contributing to increased violence in cities like New York, Chicago, and Dallas. This collaboration has essentially created a conduit for the CCP’s interests, using Mexican cartels as proxies in their broader strategy of unrestricted warfare against the U.S. “The Chinese have weaponized Mexican cartels and used them as proxies in their unrestricted warfare on the United States,” Blair stated, underscoring the critical nature of this alliance. The implications are far-reaching, affecting not only border security but also the fabric of American society. Blair’s analysis calls for urgent attention and action, as these threats are no longer confined to the borders but have penetrated into everyday American life. His insights reveal a complex web of geopolitical alliances that demand a strategic and robust response from U.S. policymakers.  George Pond, a policy expert and Texas native, discussed the pressing issue of the Chinese-Mexican cartel alliance and its implications for U.S. security. Pond highlighted the fictional novel “Cartel Wars” by Dr. Richard Funk, which explores this dangerous collaboration. The novel envisions a scenario where Mexican cartels, supported by China, invade the U.S., with the narrative focusing on an invasion of Texas and its impact on American resilience. Pond emphasized that the book reflects real concerns about border security and geopolitical threats. He noted, “The book captures the essence of what could happen if we remain complacent about the growing threat from these alliances.” He connected the fictional narrative to recent events, drawing parallels with global conflicts and the vulnerabilities exposed by America’s open border policies. Pond’s discussion underscores the urgent need to address these emerging threats. He warned of a broader strategic challenge, stating, “We have been under an invasion for a long time,” referring to the ongoing impacts of drug warfare, human smuggling, and threats to critical infrastructure. His remarks suggest that understanding and addressing these risks are crucial for safeguarding national security and preparing for potential future conflicts.

In a War Room segment, John Mills warns of escalating tensions as Ukraine employs advanced missiles like the JASSM via F-16s, potentially provoking a severe Russian response. He calls this move “incredibly provocative” and cautions against further escalation. Mills also critiques the Biden administration’s approach to global conflicts, describing it as “provocative at the wrong time.” He points out that while Ukraine’s military maneuvers may be driven by fears of a Trump victory, the U.S. is acting from a “position of weakness.” Mills links economic struggles to geopolitical tensions, noting that the U.S. and China are engaged in “asymmetric warfare” targeting each other’s systems. He expresses concern over U.S. elites, including both Democrats and Republicans, being “captured” by Chinese influence, undermining America’s defense and fiscal stability. Mills emphasizes the need for the U.S. to act with “resolve, clarity, and strength” to protect the constitutional republic. Natalie Winter explains that based on her 2022 article, George Soros and China are funding election oversight groups in 2024.  Mike Howell discusses his ongoing investigations into illegal alien voting in swing states, highlighting issues similar to those found in North Carolina and Georgia. He states, “it’s like shooting fish in a barrel” due to how easy it is to find non-citizens registered to vote. Howell argues that illegal voter registration is a significant problem, despite media misinformation, and claims the U.S. is “in huge trouble” as the country faces an invasion. He also criticizes U.S. funding for UK disinformation studies, calling for the House Appropriations Committee to cut budgets for foreign censorship collaborations targeting free speech online.  Natalie Winters explains “RINOS” as Republicans who want to control the Republican Party for themselves and says they are not interested in Trump’s victory.  Mike Ben explains his use of “The Bob” to describe the intelligence agencies that appear to work against the American people in elections. He includes operations in the United Kingdom, which he claims are coordinated with American counterparts to impact elections and candidates.  Natalie Winters explains that the Department of Justice has been weaponized against Steve Bannon and he has been imprisoned to keep him quiet.  Ben Bergquam strongly criticizes the Biden administration, particularly Kamala Harris, for the failure to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, leading to severe humanitarian and security crises. He highlights the tragic issue of missing children, stating, “Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of different nature.” According to Bergquam, the incomplete border wall east of Nogales, Arizona, is now controlled by cartels, and the lack of border patrol agents in the area underscores the severity of the situation. He points out that the cartels have operational control, with lookout points, armed men, and even solar panels to facilitate illegal crossings and drug smuggling. Bergquam specifically blames Kamala Harris and Joe Biden for this failure, asserting that their refusal to complete the wall has left the border wide open, allowing cartels to profit while American citizens suffer. “The reason this section of wall is not complete is because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didn’t want it built,” he claims. He adds that the Democratic Party’s opposition to border security is not just policy-based but ideological, accusing them of chanting “no borders, no walls, no USA at all.” He connects this failure to broader issues, such as the rise in fentanyl deaths and violence caused by illegal aliens, and asserts that both Harris and Biden have turned a blind eye to the crisis. “If Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in any of these Democrats actually cared about kids, they would be talking about it. They would be undoing their policies that have invited this,” Bergquam argues, highlighting their lack of response to the ongoing tragedy. Bergquam also recounts his own experience witnessing cartel activity at the border, describing cartel bunkers and drug mules preparing to cross into the U.S., which only stopped when he was present. He warns that if the current administration and their policies remain in place, “we’re screwed as a country,” but expresses hope that the American people are waking up to the situation and will take action in the next election. His closing message is a call for unity in defending the values that make America great.  Sabin Howard, a renowned sculptor, reflects on his nine-year journey creating the National World War I Memorial, “A Soldier’s Journey,” highlighting its larger significance. "Today’s not about me, this sculpture is not about me. I am in service of something way larger than myself,” Sabin remarks. His journey began from humble beginnings, starting at age 19 without even knowing what a portfolio was, and now, 41 years later, he’s completed this monumental 60-foot-long, 38-figure composition. The sculpture draws inspiration from the experiences of veterans, symbolizing "our unlimited potential as human beings” and incorporating elements of nobility, suffering, and healing. Sabin emphasizes that this artwork is for the public: "This sculpture is for you… It is about human beings, every single aspect in expression of how we feel.” His wife and project manager, Rachel, questions him on the parallels between his personal and artistic journeys. Sabin explains that the experience taught him to "believe in the sacred” and create a work that elevates people and embodies American cultural excellence, reflecting on the veterans who served as models and the spiritual transformation the project brought him. Part ONE:  Part Two:  Part THREE: In the second part of their conversation, Sabin Howard and his wife Rachel discuss the upcoming unveiling of the National World War I Memorial and its impact. Sabin emphasizes the sculpture’s deep human connection, describing it as a way of bringing people together. “I’ve taken art, putting it in your hands,” he says, noting the sculpture’s role in fostering unity. Reflecting on the horrors of war, Sabin recalls a childhood memory of seeing a stark image from the Vietnam War, which continues to shape his artistic vision. He discusses the destructive forces threatening societal cohesion and how his work aims to counter that by creating art that highlights interconnectedness. Sabin points out that the sculpture’s themes of suffering, sacrifice, and healing are universal, adding, "We are all made in God’s image.” Sabin also stresses the importance of preserving history through monuments, warning that erasing historical memory can lead to societal decay. He sees his art as a way to inspire and unite people, aspiring to create more memorials that celebrate American exceptionalism. The memorial, Sabin hopes, will “rebuild our country with beauty,” focusing on humanity and resilience over destruction.  Part FOUR:

Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts about the assassination attempts on President Trump.  Eric Prince raised concerns about the federal government and law enforcement’s handling of political violence and threats, particularly against Donald Trump. He criticized the FBI, referencing their actions in Florida and the raid on Mar-a-Lago, questioning their ability to seek truth. Prince emphasized that Florida should lead investigations due to the federal government’s lack of credibility. He also described an attempted assassination on Trump by an individual who was seeking recognition as a left-wing hero. Prince highlighted the need for more robust security measures, suggesting that private sector and special operations forces could be used to protect Trump by anticipating potential threats. He stressed that maintaining the safety of presidential candidates is crucial for national security and election integrity, expressing gratitude for Trump’s survival while calling for the left to denounce violence.  Mike Benz criticized the official narrative about Ryan Ruth, dismissing it as nonsense. He claims Ruth was heavily involved in recruiting foreign fighters, particularly from regions like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, to join the Ukrainian conflict. Benz highlighted Ruth’s role in collecting passports from terrorists and securing visas for them to enter Ukraine, bypassing local embassies. He drew parallels to a previous “visas for terrorists” operation detailed by Michael Springman, a former State Department official, which involved the CIA facilitating visas for the 9/11 hijackers. Benz argues that Ruth’s actions reflect a continuation of similar covert operations, implicating U.S. intelligence agencies.  Matt Boyle from Breitbart discussed the recent assassination attempts on former President Trump, highlighting severe security lapses within the U.S. Secret Service. Over two months, two individuals exploited weaknesses in Trump’s security detail, with one attacker successfully firing shots, wounding Trump and killing a person. In the second incident, a Secret Service agent intercepted a gunman near Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course. Boyle questioned how attackers pinpointed Trump’s location, given the non-public nature of his schedule, speculating potential insider involvement from Trump’s campaign, the FBI, or Homeland Security. Boyle further criticized the lack of transparency from federal agencies and praised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for initiating a state investigation. The rhetoric of left-wing media was also scrutinized, linking the shooter’s radicalization to his consumption of mainstream media and engagement with political figures. Boyle raised concerns about FBI bias, urging congressional action to ensure the safety of Trump and his family.  Luke Mahoney, Matt Boyle, and Alex DeGrasse expressed serious concerns over intelligence warnings of foreign adversaries targeting former President Trump and Senator JD Vance, highlighting unprecedented threats to their security. Mahoney noted the lack of transparency from federal agencies, especially regarding the FBI’s withholding of key information about recent assassination attempts. Boyle criticized the media for radicalizing individuals through inflammatory narratives, pointing out the suspect’s extreme views fueled by left-wing rhetoric. DeGrasse stressed the need for urgent congressional action and a deeper investigation into how assailants could track Trump’s movements. He also raised concerns about potential federal involvement in the assailants’ activities. All three called for greater accountability from federal agencies, stronger security measures, and more aggressive action from Congress to protect Trump, noting that drastic times require drastic measures. They also discussed the shifting voter registration landscape in Pennsylvania, with Republicans gaining ground on Democrats, which could impact future elections. Part ONE: Part TWO:   Alex DeGrasse’s comments emphasize the importance of vigilance in political campaigns. He highlights a scheme by a secretive group that allegedly recruited far-right candidates to pull votes from Republicans in battleground races. DeGrasse warns that Democratic operatives may infiltrate online discussions to manipulate GOP efforts, stressing the need for caution when engaging with unfamiliar individuals. He also discusses how early voting can play a decisive role in securing election victories, particularly in key states like Pennsylvania. He calls on Trump supporters to become poll watchers and ensure that ballots are properly counted. Additionally, DeGrasse underscores the need to target specific districts, mobilize voters, and raise financial support to ensure a robust early voting effort. The ultimate goal is to secure enough votes to avoid potential election day challenges and ensure Republican victories in crucial races.  Alex DeGrasse and Luke Mahoney emphasize the urgency of grassroots involvement in the final stretch before the election. They stress the need for “ramparts action” — working phone lines, canvassing, and recruiting poll watchers to ensure election integrity. A particular focus is on securing early votes in battleground states like Pennsylvania. They highlight a recent revelation of Democrats recruiting far-right candidates to siphon votes from Republicans, underscoring the importance of vigilance in online interactions and campaign operations. DeGrasse warns of potential efforts to undermine GOP campaigns, while Mahoney calls for early voting to mitigate election day risks. Their message is clear: grassroots mobilization, securing early votes, and vigilance are key to winning the election.  Alex DeGrasse stresses the importance of early voting in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where securing early votes can create a critical lead before election day. He emphasizes that visible support for Trump through signs and flags is a mental validation for the movement’s strength. DeGrasse calls for voters to engage by ensuring three people they know vote early. He highlights three crucial House races in Pennsylvania that could influence Trump’s victory and warns that Democrats may attempt to overturn the election results using the 14th Amendment. DeGrasse concludes with a call for grassroots action, donations, and vigilance.

Natalie Winters gave her thoughts about Hillary Clinton.  Mike Davis discussed the ever-emerging immigration crisis and exposed why so many influential people prefer controlled immigration over the more orderly, rules-based immigration system in the United States.  Scott Presler passionately encouraged War Room Posse members to check their voter registration status on National Voter Registration Day, urging them to ensure they’re registered at their current address and with their preferred party, especially in closed primary states. He raised concerns about Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, where thousands of voter registration and mail-in ballot applications reportedly remain unprocessed. Presler emphasized that Luzerne is pivotal, being a Democrat stronghold potentially flipping Republican, with the voter registration deadline looming. He warned that delays in processing mail-in ballots could disenfranchise voters, especially in tight election margins, and encouraged everyone to demand accountability. Additionally, he highlighted the increase in Republican mail-in ballot requests in Pennsylvania counties and promoted voter registration among underrepresented groups like hunters and the Amish. Presler urged action, encouraging people to distribute voter registration forms, particularly in colleges and veterans’ organizations, to ensure wider voter participation.  Mike Davis discussed the importance of election officials being transparent about election issues to dispel voters’ concerns and gain the most trust from the public.  In a conversation between Mike Davis and Jeremy Kaufmann, Kaufmann shared his unsettling experience with federal agents visiting his home. He described it as “the least American experience” in his life, noting that the agents refused to identify themselves or explain their presence. Kaufmann, a self-proclaimed libertarian from New Hampshire, believes the visit was intended as political intimidation. He voiced concern that the government is targeting "right-thinking Americans” while ignoring genuine threats, such as "illegal Venezuelan gangs” in other states. Davis echoed these concerns, criticizing the federal government’s lack of resources for protecting key figures like Donald Trump. Kaufmann sees these actions as part of a broader left-wing authoritarian agenda, yet he remains hopeful about New Hampshire’s future, stating, “We still have tens of millions… who hold these Pro Liberty values.” He is determined to continue speaking out, adding, "I’m not planning to let up.”  Lee Smith, author of Disappearing the President, talked about the escalation of the media and other political pundits to set up a narrative that President Trump would have to be shot because of his dangerous narrative.

Natalie Winters talks about her anger toward Mike Johnson and the other Republicans who support him, and she decries the use of a Continuing Resolution and called for the WarRoom audience to use BillBlaster and contact their reps with feedback about doing so. Part One:  Part Two:  Darren Beattie critiques the Biden administration and DOJ for weaponizing institutions against political opponents, especially Donald Trump. He calls the timing of recent events, including Merrick Garland’s “rehabilitation tour,” suspicious, particularly in the context of accusations of institutional corruption. Beattie claims this reflects a broader effort to suppress opposition and points to the “Fed’surrection” narrative as a key example. He criticizes media outlets like 60 Minutes for ignoring valid counterpoints, such as those he raised about Ray Epps, which were excluded from a segment attacking him and Tucker Carlson. Beattie argues that the regime manipulates narratives, portraying Capitol Police as victims while ignoring assassination attempts on Trump. He says, “It’s so pathetic… and gives up the game.” He also condemns the handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, highlighting the human toll and claiming the U.S. has squandered nearly $200 billion in support for a corrupt cause. Beattie criticizes Kamala Harris and others for escalating tensions. He believes Trump stands alone in seeking peace, stating, "He’s the only guy who wants it to end,” contrasting him with the "greedy filth running our country.” Beattie urges Trump to continue confronting these corrupt elements until real change occurs.  In a discussion with Jeff Clark and Kingsley Cortes, they highlighted the weaponization of the Department of Justice (DOJ) against figures like Clark. Kingsley explained that their documentary aimed to show how “Jeff’s only crime is supporting President Trump and believing in the Constitution,” while exposing how such beliefs are treated as criminal in today’s political climate. They emphasize the need for accountability, stating, “It’s not retribution or revenge to hold people accountable.” Jeff Clark reflected on his own targeting, attributing it to his desire to investigate the 2020 election: “I didn’t think that I would ever be such a major target.” The conversation also touched on Steve Bannon’s commitment to the movement, as he conducted an interview with them on the day he was set to report to prison, showcasing his dedication to the cause.  Reagan Reese highlighted concerns regarding CBS News’ potential bias as it prepares to host the vice-presidential debate. She noted that CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, have leadership who previously donated to President Biden’s 2020 campaign. Reese pointed out that the CBS president, though she donated while at ABC News, hasn’t done so since. However, she emphasized that this connection could be a point of contention for the Trump campaign, which has a history of criticizing networks for bias. “The Trump campaign really hit CNN and ABC ahead of both debates on their past bias and connections to the Biden campaign,” Reese said. She also referenced the controversy surrounding the ABC debate, where moderators seemed to target Trump while ignoring false claims by Kamala Harris. With the upcoming vice-presidential debate potentially being the last of the 2024 cycle, Reese expects the Trump campaign to challenge CBS’s impartiality.  Jack Posobiec discussed Steve Bannon’s imprisonment, portraying him as a political prisoner fighting the Deep State. Posobiec noted reports from a former inmate stating that Bannon “is praying every day” and attending church regularly while working behind the scenes for a 2024 victory. He emphasized the need for action, stating, “This isn’t about waiting for someone else to come in… We are the ones that ultimately will fall to.” Posobiec then shifted focus to a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, criticizing The New York Times for initially portraying the suspect, Ryan Wesley Rath, as a “Crusader for causes large and small,” which he likened to glorifying the would-be assassin. Posobiec argued that the media is complicit in inciting such attacks, saying, “Positive press coverage has incited…copycat attackers.” He accused the media of misinformation and propaganda, contrasting their treatment of Trump and his supporters with their portrayal of Rath. Posobiec linked the suspect to Ukraine and migrant crime, promoting his book Bulletproof, which details assassination attempts on Trump. Mark Mitchell and Jack Posobiec offer a detailed analysis of the current political climate and polling data, with a focus on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Mark Mitchell discusses the stability of polling data, noting, “We’re the only pollster putting out daily data,” which reveals little change despite various political events. He emphasizes that Trump is showing consistent numbers, with recent polls indicating a tight race. “Trump was up five way back at the end of July,” but the current data shows “Trump plus two.” Mitchell points out that even with significant events, such as the DNC or Trump’s controversial incidents, “nothing’s really changed,” suggesting Trump’s lead remains steady. He highlights that independent voters are crucial and that Pennsylvania will be a key battleground state, noting, “Trump is doing eight points better in our polling than he was four years ago.” Jack Posobiec critiques Axios for promoting the “red mirage” narrative, questioning its validity given the current polling data. He argues, “Republicans overperform when Trump is on the ballot” and suggests that despite various shocks to the system, such as Trump’s controversies, “the numbers haven’t really changed.” Posobiec also points out that Kamala Harris struggles with independent voters, who “hate the Biden regime,” and views Trump as a “fresh start” compared to Harris’s perceived continuity with the current administration. Part One:  Part TWO:  Part THREE:  In their discussion, Jack Posobiec and Sam Faddis analyzed significant security failures surrounding Donald Trump, specifically highlighting two assassination attempts. Faddis, reflecting on his Substack article, emphasized that the U.S. government is making a “conscious affirmative decision” not to provide adequate security for Trump, despite his high-profile threats from groups like Iran’s Quds Force. He criticized the lack of surveillance and preparedness, noting how “one drone with an infrared camera” could have easily detected a would-be sniper waiting for 12 hours. Posobiec and Faddis stressed that the media’s portrayal of such incidents, like Ryan Wesley Rath’s assassination attempt, could incite copycat attacks. Posobiec claimed, “The media is complicit,” pointing out that Rath had been in contact with major outlets before the event. The conversation questioned whether these media contacts had foreknowledge of the attack. Faddis concluded by saying, “No reasonable person would think” the government will provide honest responses to these security concerns, emphasizing the dire implications of inadequate protection.  JacK Posobiec and Cliff Maloney discussed critical insights into Pennsylvania’s electoral landscape. Maloney reported, "We have 120 full-time ballot chasers on the ground in Pennsylvania,” and highlighted a significant drop in Democratic mail-in ballot requests, noting, "Democrats are down 303,000 compared to 2020.” He also observed that "the energy is not there for Kamala,” reflecting a decline in enthusiasm compared to past elections. Posobiec expressed doubts about Kamala Harris’s campaign strategy, stating, "I think she’s going to try all the identity politics she can, but there’s no coalition to put together.” Maloney emphasized the strategic importance of President Trump’s upcoming visit to Southeastern Pennsylvania, asserting, "The event at Our Lady of Chestohova is huge for Polish Americans and will resonate more than any ad Harris might run.” The discussion underscored a strategic push to leverage grassroots efforts and counter Democratic advantages.

Natalie Winters talks about Chip Roy coming to the WarRoom on Wednesday to discuss his reason for wanting the Save Act attached to the funding bill, which she is against.  Darren Beattie discusses what he sees as a pattern of suspicious incidents involving President Trump and bomb threats, including a recent event in Long Island. Initially reported as an explosive device near a Trump speech venue, the media quickly dismissed it as a false alarm and labeled those concerned as conspiracy theorists. Beattie highlights an unusual detail: a private citizen, unaffiliated with law enforcement, was training a bomb-detection dog at the same location. He draws parallels between this incident and historical events like 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing, where training exercises coincided with real-world crises. Beattie suggests the possibility of government involvement or cover-ups, criticizing the media for ignoring deeper questions, such as the identity of the private citizen involved and the implications of this peculiar timing. He questions the media’s focus on discrediting figures like Elon Musk rather than investigating these bizarre circumstances further.  Kristan Hawkins discusses the tragic death of Amber, a woman who sought a chemical abortion for her twins in North Carolina but died of sepsis after receiving abortion drugs. Amber missed her surgical appointment and was sent home unsupervised after taking the medication. She fell severely ill, eventually reaching an ER, where despite treatment for infection, a hysterectomy was delayed for 20 hours, and she ultimately died. Hawkins compares this case to another in New Mexico, where Aisha Atkins also died of sepsis following a chemical abortion, but with little media attention, as it occurred in a pro-abortion state. Hawkins criticizes the Biden-Harris administration’s FDA, blaming them for Amber’s death due to their removal of safety protocols for chemical abortions in December 2021. She argues that the administration prioritized expanding abortion access over ensuring the safety of mothers, abandoning safeguards like ultrasounds and follow-up visits that could prevent such tragedies. Hawkins emphasizes the political motivations behind these changes, suggesting they disregarded women’s health. Part One:  Part Two:  Todd Bensman reported to the WarRoom after attending a committee meeting at the US Capitol earlier in the day.  Bensman talked the dangerous situations we can expect in the future because at least 400 terrorists have come over the Southern border.  Joe Allen, sitting in for Steve Bannon, highlights concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal impact. He discusses the growing influence of AI, noting how it has infiltrated daily life like “soulless insects.” Allen criticizes the shift towards reliance on non-human entities, especially in schools and religious settings, where AI is used to guide learning and even spiritual practices. He warns that this “cultural revolution” will increasingly replace human interaction with machines, with AI becoming a dominant companion for many. Allen also points to the surveillance potential of AI, referencing Larry Ellison of Oracle and his vision of AI being used for behavior modification by constantly monitoring individuals. He connects this to broader concerns about privacy erosion, especially post-Patriot Act, where surveillance has stifled political dissent and made privacy seem obsolete. Allen warns that AI’s pervasive surveillance could eventually lead to imprisonment for mere speech, amplifying concerns over personal freedom and autonomy.  Noor Bin Ladin discusses the increasing global push for censorship, particularly against free speech, under the guise of combating misinformation and disinformation. She highlights speeches from figures like Ursula von der Leyen and Hillary Clinton, noting that they call for collaboration between governments, corporations, and institutions to suppress dissent. Ladin argues that these actions are eroding civil liberties, as seen in cases of individuals facing legal consequences for online posts in the U.S., U.K., and Switzerland. She criticizes how these powerful entities determine what constitutes misinformation while being major purveyors of it themselves. Ladin warns that the growing digital surveillance and censorship are leading to a “digital dystopia,” where individuals risk imprisonment for merely expressing dissenting views. She emphasizes the urgency of resisting this control before freedoms are completely lost, pointing out that without free speech, people cannot challenge these oppressive systems.  In the discussion, Tim Hinchcliffe critiques the U.N.’s Global Digital Compact, expressing concern about its underlying motives. While the compact uses appealing language, Hinchcliffe views it as a tool for expanding digital control, censorship, and surveillance under the guise of fostering inclusion and safety. The initiative, set to be debated by the U.N., aims to restructure digital frameworks and address the digital divide, but also introduces broader surveillance measures and tighter data governance. Hinchcliffe highlights that this push aligns with transhumanist goals, where governments and corporations collaborate to enforce control. He questions the potential tensions between globalist and nationalist objectives, as some U.N. member states are defiant towards overarching global governance. Ultimately, the compact is seen as advancing digital authoritarianism, which could further entrench governmental and corporate powers over individuals while limiting dissenting perspectives.

Rep. Tim Burchett discussed the belief that President Trump’s return to Washington is the only thing that can save the United States at this point because the House and Senate are so divided and unwilling to separate themselves from the centralized power of the established order there.  Natalie Winters talked about her feelings over Mike Turner’s social media, where he made critical remarks about Donald Trump.  Noor Bin Ladin talked about the background of the United Nations and talked about what she expected was going to come out of the General Assembly there in New Yorl.   Adam Wren talked about his 6 month investigation into the life of Mike Davis and some of the foundation of his reporting on Davis and Article 3 Project for Politico.  Mike Davis and Andrew Ferguson discuss Ferguson’s background and achievements, highlighting his key roles in confirming Justices Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, transforming the federal judiciary during the Trump administration. Ferguson, formerly the Solicitor General of Virginia, now serves as a Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, where he led major antitrust actions, particularly against Google. The conversation centers on Ferguson’s admiration for Justice Clarence Thomas, emphasizing Thomas’ resilience against ongoing progressive attacks and his unwavering commitment to constitutional principles. Ferguson also reflects on Trump’s judicial appointments, underscoring the importance of selecting judges with strong backbones to withstand leftist pressure. Both agree that Trump’s second term should focus on appointing more originalist judges willing to stand firm under scrutiny, especially regarding critical issues like race, religious liberty, and free speech.  In this discussion, Mike Davis interviews Jeff Clark, a former top Justice Department official under Trump, about the legal and political persecution he has faced. Clark details how he was targeted for providing legal advice on the 2020 election and investigations into election irregularities. He explained how Attorney General Barr had shut down the investigations he had recommended. Clark recounts being smeared by the media, targeted by congressional committees, and having his home raided by the Justice Department. He discusses his involvement in cases led by Fani Willis and Jack Smith, and the implications of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Clark argues that these legal battles represent political persecution, particularly for the defendants on January 6, and calls for consequences for the misuse of justice.

Natalie Winters talks about her disappointment in Speaker Mike Johnson.  Russ Vought warns that moving into a lame-duck session could lead to an omnibus bill, typically rushed after elections and leading to poor policies. He criticizes this process, arguing that it results in massive, unreadable bills passed hastily, and urges Republicans to resist. Vought is concerned that such a bill would fund “woke” federal programs at high levels, undermining potential future efforts by a second Trump administration. He stresses that Republicans should minimize support for the bill, pushing Hakeem Jeffries to carry it. Despite Speaker Johnson’s opposition to large omnibus bills, Vought believes institutional pressures will likely lead to large, hurried bills like in the past. He also refutes fears of a government shutdown, claiming shutdowns often benefit Republicans politically by showing their commitment to their policy objectives and criticizes Washington D.C.’s reluctance to engage in such brinkmanship.  Ed Dowd highlights that economic downturns typically manifest 18 months after policy changes, which are now evident in 2023. He notes a looming commercial real estate crisis and rising credit risks, with no bailout likely. Government hiring and illegal immigration have temporarily buoyed the economy, but this support is fading. He points to the U.S. housing market, where home prices are at an all-time high compared to household income, and investors are buying up lower-priced homes. Dowd suggests easing red tape to build more housing, which could help alleviate the housing crisis, but warns it will take time to see effects.  Mike Benz discusses a letter revealing threats and actions taken by U.S. government agencies, including the FBI and the Justice Department, against individuals. He mentions concerns about withholding information, particularly a manifesto, due to fears of misinformation spreading online. Benz highlights the case of an individual with a long criminal history, protected by authorities despite numerous arrests and an assassination attempt. He suggests possible ties between this person’s wife and the U.S. defense industry, particularly Maximus Corporation, which works with the Department of Defense. Benz questions the wife’s financial backing of activities related to Ukraine recruitment. He also links the defense establishment to efforts against former President Trump, citing multiple national security officials who have opposed Trump since his campaign. Benz implies that the defense sector has played a significant role in attempts to undermine Trump’s presidency, and he raises concerns about censorship and media manipulation in these efforts.  This conversation is a call to action, emphasizing the urgency of getting involved in the 2024 elections. The host, Alex, guest-hosting for Steve Bannon on War Room Battleground, urges listeners to start volunteering now, whether by supporting a candidate or addressing key ballot issues. With 42 days until the election, the message is clear: it’s time for all hands on deck, as early voting is underway in key battleground states. Alex reports that Donald Trump is ramping up his campaign events, focusing on battleground states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, with plans to expand efforts nationwide, including red states like Alabama and swing states like Minnesota and Maine. The discussion touches on Trump’s policy issues, such as preventing foreign control of American farmland and addressing immigration crises, particularly the impact of Haitian and Venezuelan migrants. Trump is running a 50-state strategy, leveraging union dissatisfaction (notably from the Teamsters) and seeing favorable polling in Rust Belt and Sunbelt states. The message also highlights the importance of “ballot chasing” – ensuring that Republican voters return their ballots at a higher rate than Democrats. Volunteers are encouraged to get lists of voters with outstanding ballots and make calls to increase turnout. The conversation underscores that Trump has multiple pathways to securing the 270 electoral votes, with critical support from Senate races and strong grassroots operations. The overarching theme is mobilizing Trump supporters to take action immediately to secure victory in the upcoming election. Part ONE:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Grace Chong talked about the BillBlaster app and emphasized the importance of early voting. She highlighted her efforts by texting and calling voters, particularly in Pennsylvania, from her home in California. Chong also mentioned how crucial it is to get low-propensity voters engaged, noting that early voting helps prevent last-minute issues, citing an example of her mother in 2012, who couldn’t vote due to an accident. Chong stressed the significance of the BillBlaster app, urging people to call their representatives regarding House Resolution 1305, a bill aimed at supporting Steve Bannon. She emphasized the need to get 218 signatures for a discharge petition and encouraged supporters to push daily for this. According to Chong, early voting and using tools like BillBlaster can make a substantial impact, and she urged Bannon’s “Posse” to show their support for him and his causes through these platforms.

Alex Jones expressed admiration for the passion and faith of populists, describing their shared love for God, freedom, and America as “radical” in today’s society. He pointed out that for 30 years, he has consistently opposed wars, standing for peace with information against globalists like Soros and Obama. Discussing recent legal battles, Jones highlighted that InfoWars is facing liquidation while media consolidation favors figures like Soros. Despite these challenges, he vowed to continue broadcasting, provided he is not imprisoned or killed. Jones connected InfoWars’ persecution to a broader globalist agenda aiming to dismantle America. He predicted that Trump’s potential electoral victory will be undermined by fraud and even assassination attempts. He concluded by stressing that the upcoming election is “the most important in modern history,” with threats against Trump symbolizing deep state desperation.  Natalie Winters continued her harsh critique of Speaker Johnson.  Jeff Clark discussed his research on legal cases, particularly focusing on a specific individual’s litigation history. He shared that he used the Westlaw legal research database, which he finds more comprehensive than others, to search for cases where this person was involved. Clark said he examined both federal and state cases, “not even confining it just to California,” and used advanced search logic to identify relevant cases. His findings showed that “she did not argue any cases,” and he couldn’t locate trial transcripts either, which he found suspicious. Clark expressed skepticism, saying, “I’ve never heard of a court in the United States that would not allow you to duplicate a transcript of a public trial.” He hinted at uncovering more information soon, promising “more research” to be released shortly.  Dr. Bradley Thayer testified before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, discussing the multifaceted Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which he described as an ideological and geopolitical struggle. He emphasized that communism, a “Western ideology imported into China,” is central to the CCP’s aggression and has caused immense destruction, erasing China’s cultural pillars and killing millions. Thayer argued that understanding the CCP’s communist ideology is critical for Congress and federal agencies to grasp its inherently aggressive nature. He also highlighted that the CCP was a product of “Soviet imperialism,” with its origins deeply rooted in Soviet influence, from which Maoism and Xi Jinping’s modern ideology evolved. Thayer declared the CCP illegitimate for three reasons: its foundation in Soviet imperialism, its continuation of failed communist ideology, and its corrupt leadership under Xi Jinping, which only rules for itself. He concluded that the U.S. is in a “new Cold War” with China, calling it the great struggle of the 21st century, one that will determine whether the world remains free or succumbs to totalitarianism led by the CCP.  Dr. Braley Thayer highlights the significant threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in a comprehensive analysis. He emphasizes that their ideology, rooted in communism, makes them “hyper-aggressive,” viewing the U.S. as the primary obstacle to their global dominance. Thayer notes the CCP’s proficiency in “political warfare,” a strategy that allows them to achieve political objectives without direct military conflict, particularly aiming to undermine the U.S. from within. He credits Deng Xiaoping as a master of this strategy, enabling China to rise economically by integrating into global systems and exploiting U.S. investment, trade, and manufacturing. Thayer warns that current Chinese leader Xi Jinping is “extremely dangerous,” comparing his ambition to surpass even Mao Zedong. He describes China as a “bad driver” operating a “Soviet knockoff” car with flawed, aggressive communist ideology. This combination, along with volatile international conditions, creates a precarious situation. Thayer calls for ending economic engagement with China, asserting that U.S. trade and investment are saving the CCP during their current economic struggles. He concludes by urging global efforts to support the Chinese people in overthrowing the illegitimate regime, comparing the CCP’s rule to apartheid South Africa.  In a discussion involving Captain James Fanell, Sam Faddis, and Dr. Braley Thayer, the focus was on Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Waltz and his extensive connections to China, having visited the People’s Republic of China over 30 times since 1989. Sam Faddis questioned the legitimacy of Waltz’s business ties and his continuous access to China, noting that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would not allow such engagement without approval. "This whole business with Waltz just stinks,” Faddis remarked, expressing disbelief in the narrative that Waltz was advocating for democracy during his time in China. Faddis highlighted the potential dangers posed by Waltz’s involvement with China, particularly the risk of Chinese intelligence (MSS) targeting American students who accompanied Waltz on his trips. He questioned whether Waltz was naive or complicit in exposing these students to Chinese influence, suggesting that "clearly, he’s chosen a side, and it’s not ours.” Captain Fennell added to the conversation by discussing the CCP’s aggressive military actions, including a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. He emphasized that the CCP’s expansion of its nuclear arsenal presents a significant threat to U.S. national security. The panel agreed that the U.S. has failed to effectively counter CCP influence, allowing political warfare, propaganda, and infiltration to compromise American elites. Faddis warned, "The war is already started, and they’re winning because we’re not fighting back,” stressing the need for a drastic shift in U.S. strategy to disengage from China and prioritize domestic interests.

Mike Howell expressed frustration with Congress’s inaction, emphasizing the need for more aggressive enforcement of subpoenas. He criticized the tendency to issue subpoenas without follow-through, stating that “a subpoena is worthless unless you actually enforce it.” Howell urged Congress to pursue federal court action to obtain crucial information, like databases of non-detained illegal aliens, including those with criminal records such as “rapists and pedophiles and murderers.” He proposed comparing this list with voter rolls to ensure the election is decided by legitimate voters. Howell lamented Congress’s reluctance to act decisively, saying, “They’re not going to court, they’re not fighting these things,” and urged lawmakers to “see this one through.” He dismissed media attention on the issue as inconsequential, noting that it’s not a topic of interest for mainstream outlets like Vanity Fair or The New York Times but rather “low level stuff” covered by smaller outlets like The Hill.  Natalie Winters talked about battleground states.  Phillip Patrick criticized Kamala Harris’s economic policies as a continuation of Bidenomics, which he views as ineffective. Harris’s proposed tax increases on capital gains, dividends, and even unrealized gains, along with her plans for increased spending, resemble an effort to “buy votes” through short-term relief at the expense of long-term stability. In contrast, Patrick praised Trump’s economic strategy, highlighting its focus on fostering a business-friendly environment by reducing corporate taxes and not increasing individual or capital gains taxes. He acknowledged the controversial tariffs Trump proposes, particularly a 20% tariff on all imports and 60% on Chinese goods, which would cause higher prices initially but lead to long-term economic gains by boosting American manufacturing. Patrick also criticized Harris’s housing proposals, arguing that injecting more money into the economy would worsen inflation. He concluded that Trump’s willingness to make tough decisions makes him the stronger candidate for economic reform.  Jeff Clark highlighted a 2008 case involving an illegal immigrant who brutally raped a woman on a San Francisco party bus while Kamala Harris was district attorney. Despite Harris’s reputation as a tough-on-crime prosecutor, the offender received a lenient three-year sentence. Clark expressed outrage, emphasizing the severity of the crime and Harris’s failure to deliver justice. He criticized Harris for presenting herself as a defender against sex crimes while letting an illegal alien with a criminal record off lightly. Clark argued that this case shatters the myth of Harris’s prosecutorial toughness, especially when contrasted with her current stance on border security. He urged people to spread this story widely, claiming it reveals inconsistencies in Harris’s record. Clark also mentioned the eventual civil lawsuit, which awarded the victim a multimillion-dollar settlement, further spotlighting the failures of Harris’s case handling.  In the discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Paoletta, they criticize proposed Democratic efforts to reform the U.S. Supreme Court. Paoletta argues that the bill in question aims to undermine the court’s independence by expanding its size, imposing audits on justices, and enforcing new recusal rules. He compares these efforts to Hugo Chavez’s manipulation of Venezuela’s judiciary, suggesting that Democrats seek control over the court because they oppose recent rulings on issues like affirmative action and presidential immunity. Paoletta emphasizes that Congress, with its low approval rating, should focus on its own issues rather than trying to reshape the judiciary. He also highlights what he perceives as hypocrisy, where ethical concerns are selectively applied to conservative justices like Clarence Thomas while ignoring similar conflicts involving liberal justices. Ultimately, Paoletta sees these efforts as a broader assault on the Supreme Court’s integrity and constitutional role.  In a conversation between Ben Harnwell and Kristi Hamrick, they discussed the disproportionate impact of abortion on the Black community, referencing Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger, who advocated for controlling populations she deemed undesirable. Hamrick emphasized the national tragedy of abortion, particularly highlighting the high number of Black lives lost: “More Black children are aborted than born in New York City.” They also discussed the dangers of chemical abortion pills, which Hamrick described as having a higher risk of complications and death than surgical abortions: “They have four times the rate of accidents, 10 times the death rate of surgical abortion.” She criticized the lack of safety protocols, such as requiring ultrasounds to prevent complications from ectopic pregnancies. Hamrick further noted that the pro-life movement is the civil rights movement of today, drawing parallels to historical struggles for human rights. She warned Republicans not to back down, urging them to “stand strong” in defending life against what she called the “radical” Democratic stance supporting abortion up to birth. She concluded by promoting pro-life advocacy resources, including Students for Life and information on chemical abortion risks.  In their discussion, Linda Szynkowicz and Ben Harnwell highlighted significant irregularities with postal ballots in Florida, calling it the “Florida debacle.” Szynkowicz mentioned that half a million undeliverable ballots were wrongly counted in the primary, raising concerns about election integrity. She pointed out discrepancies in Miami-Dade and Pinellas Counties, where initial claims of 219,000 absentee ballot requests were later reduced to 20. Szynkowicz also expressed alarm over overseas ballots, noting the DNC’s push for 9 million U.S. citizens abroad to vote, despite only 2.4 million being eligible and no verification of voter IDs.  In their conversation, Ben Harnwell and Richard Stern discussed the economic consequences of President Biden’s proposal to offer $25,000 to first-time homebuyers. Stern warned that while it may seem beneficial on the surface, such government handouts inevitably lead to inflation. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” Stern said, pointing out that increasing government spending devalues the dollar, reducing the purchasing power of everyone else. Stern also noted that the funds required for these policies are taken from other sectors of the economy, leading to job losses and decreased investment elsewhere. He described the situation as a “Sophie’s choice,” where the government redistributes wealth through inflation without actually producing anything. Additionally, they touched on the increasing national debt and the rising costs of interest repayments, which Stern emphasized as a looming crisis. He highlighted that the U.S. is now spending more on interest payments than on defense, warning that the country faces either a debt spiral or hyperinflation. Stern expressed skepticism over the government’s ability to build 4.2 million homes efficiently, cautioning that such efforts often lead to scarcity in construction materials and further inflation.

Liz Harrington focused on the backlash against members of Georgia’s State Election Board, particularly women, who are under threat for promoting transparency and accountability in Georgia’s elections. These board members passed rules to reconcile vote counts to ensure the number of votes matches the number of voters, sparking opposition. Critics, including some from Fulton County and figures like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, are pushing back, fearing the implications of the board’s efforts to address issues like duplicate ballots. The speaker highlights the hypocrisy of media outlets like MSNBC for not defending these women despite their efforts to ensure election integrity. The commentary also references broader narratives about election integrity concerns and critiques of establishment figures.  Jenny Beth Martin provided insight into Georgia’s election integrity efforts, focusing on the ongoing fight to ensure transparent and accountable elections. She expressed approval of Governor Kemp’s decision not to remove members of the state election board, noting it as consistent with his prior actions. Martin emphasized that the board’s new rules, which reconcile vote counts and ensure ballots match voter turnout, are legal and essential for building trust in election outcomes. She also acknowledged potential legal challenges from Democrats but remained confident the rules would hold up in court. Martin encouraged grassroots action, highlighting opportunities like poll watching, phone banking, and door knocking through her organization, urging supporters not to be discouraged but to stay engaged. Lastly, she called on Governor Kemp to continue supporting election board members in their work to secure Georgia’s elections.  Todd Bensman discussed the Biden administration’s new strategy of granting refugee status to economic migrants from Latin America, which allows them to be flown into the U.S. at taxpayer expense. “We don’t normally give refugee status to Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans,” Bensman explained, highlighting the shift in policy. He criticized this approach, noting, “Whole families can board a commercial flight on a travel loan backed by U.S. State Department funds.” Bensman emphasized that this program, though legal, is largely invisible and serves to increase refugee numbers without public scrutiny. He also touched on Panama’s new president promising to close the Darien Gap, a major migration route, but noted that the U.S. is not providing enough support. "The promised American support is falling short,” he said, adding that migration numbers through the Darien Gap remain high despite repatriation efforts.  Natalie Winters talks about her ideas for the proper use of Ukraine funding.  Natalie Winters talks about the level of betrayal of Liz Cheney endorsing radical Democrat Kamala Harris for President.  Noor Bin Laden criticized NATO for its role in promoting “cognitive warfare” while ironically naming its program after the same tactics it has long employed. She claimed NATO has been "weaponizing and devising narratives” to subvert political movements globally, including Ukraine and right-wing populist movements like Brexit and MAGA. Bin Laden highlighted the use of “disinformation” to undermine sovereign nations, pointing to globalist agendas supported by NATO and other institutions like the UN, which she believes are working together since their post-World War II inception. She further linked NATO to globalist efforts, suggesting that disinformation campaigns aim to erode national sovereignty. "They deploy these weapons because we stand in the way of their new world order,” she stated. Bin Laden also touched on how platforms like Twitter are manipulated under a "honey pot slash data mining operation,” casting doubt on Elon Musk’s actions regarding free speech. She underscored that understanding these techniques is key to resisting "globalism” and "communism 2.0.”  Sam Faddis has criticized the current narratives surrounding U.S. foreign policy and election integrity, calling them misleading and harmful. Faddis argues that the ongoing war in Ukraine, which he deems an opportunity for corporate profit, risks escalating into a larger conflict. “This policy…has us dancing right along the knife’s edge of a much bigger conflict and potentially a nuclear exchange,” he warns. He agrees with Donald Trump’s stance that a negotiated solution would end the conflict, emphasizing that “we can end this in effect anytime we want.” Addressing recent claims about Russian interference in U.S. politics, Faddis dismisses them as part of a “Russian collusion hoax.” He criticizes the portrayal of Trump as a Russian ally, stating that “anybody with common sense” would recognize Putin’s disinterest in dealing with Trump. Faddis also condemns the narrative that questions about election integrity are part of a Russian plot, arguing it serves to silence legitimate concerns. “If you raise any questions about the Integrity of the system you’re doing Putin’s bidding,” he asserts.

On Monday’s WarRoom, Ben Bergquam criticized the Biden administration for abandoning border wall materials, wasting taxpayer money, and allowing the border to remain porous. He highlighted the story of Coptic Christians from Egypt who were held captive by the Sinaloa cartel for 12 days while attempting to seek asylum in the U.S. Bergquam argued that Biden and Harris’s border policies enable cartels to exploit vulnerable migrants and facilitate drug and human trafficking. He emphasized the ongoing crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, accusing Biden and Harris of lying about border security. He warned that the continued neglect of immigration issues would lead to the collapse of American sovereignty, stressing that the future of the country hinges on strong border enforcement and leadership change in Washington.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene voiced strong criticism of the Biden administration’s handling of illegal immigration, the Ukraine war, and the two-tier justice system. She condemned the impact of immigration on small towns, describing how the influx of migrants has overwhelmed local resources. Greene cited "unbelievable” reports of pets being harmed and schools being strained due to an influx of non-English-speaking students. She also accused Biden of failing to prioritize American needs, lamenting that seniors are “literally eating dog food” while funds are sent abroad. Greene criticized the Justice Department’s treatment of January 6th defendants, claiming a two-tiered justice system. She highlighted how innocent people, including veterans and grandmothers, are being unfairly prosecuted while cities like Washington D.C. face rising crime. Greene called for greater accountability and action ahead of the 2024 election, insisting that Americans are fed up with the current administration’s policies and the justice system’s perceived bias.  Natalie Winters shared her frustration with illegal immigration and with Mike Rogers.  At Club 47 in Palm Beach County, there was a special screening of the documentary Government Gangsters, based on Kash Patel’s book. The film highlights the actions of the Deep State, covering scandals like Russiagate and the Hunter Biden laptop controversy. It also criticizes figures like FBI Director Christopher Wray and former Director James Comey, exposing their alleged misconduct. The documentary supports Donald Trump and critiques political dynasties like the Bidens, Clintons, and Cheneys. The discussion touched on Liz Cheney’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, seen as part of the political establishment’s opposition to Trump’s anti-war policies. The film tour is set to continue nationwide.  In a discussion between Brian Schimming, Wisconsin GOP chairman, and Jayne Zirkle, Schimming highlighted the strong support for Donald Trump during a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, where over 10,000 attendees gathered. Schimming emphasized key issues driving Republican support in the state, notably the economy, inflation, border security, and violent crime. He described how illegal immigration is impacting local communities and noted the GOP’s focus on election integrity, recruiting 6,000 poll workers and deploying thousands of observers. Schimming also addressed the challenge of mobilizing new voters, including college students and groups like hunters who may not traditionally vote Republican but align with key issues like the Second Amendment. He emphasized the importance of early voting and grassroots efforts, primarily through the Trump campaign’s “Trump Force 47” initiative, aimed at recruiting volunteers and reaching out to neglected voter bases. Schimming concluded by urging active participation in the final critical weeks leading up to the election, stressing that saving America is the ultimate goal.  Jayne Zirkle and Mike Gableman discussed the significant impact of a recent shift in the Wisconsin Supreme Court from a conservative to a liberal majority. Gableman criticized the court’s recent ruling, which allowed unsupervised ballot drop boxes, overturning a previous decision that had banned them. He expressed concerns that this ruling could lead to absurd situations, such as ballots being collected in unsecure places. Gableman also emphasized the importance of voter turnout, urging people to pray and work diligently to ensure that Donald Trump is supported in the upcoming election. He stressed the need for active engagement and outreach to increase voter participation, especially given the narrow margins in past elections. Additionally, Gableman criticized Wisconsin’s Republican leadership, particularly Speaker Robin Vos, for his perceived lack of support for Trump.  Jayne Zirkle and Sam Markstein discussed the recent Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) conference in Las Vegas, highlighting its significance given the recent turmoil in the Middle East. Markstein emphasized that the RJC remains crucial in the political landscape, particularly in light of the tragic Hamas attacks and the murder of six hostages. He noted the Republican Party’s strong support for Israel, contrasting it with what he views as inadequate support from the current administration. Markstein criticized the Biden administration’s handling of international relations and anti-Semitism, citing the increased influence of Iranian-backed groups and anti-Semitic incidents on U.S. college campuses. He praised President Trump’s past policies, which he believes ensured better security for Jewish communities and a firmer stance against terrorism. Markstein expressed hope that Jewish voters will continue to lean towards the Republican Party, as demonstrated by growing support in key battleground states. He urged listeners to engage with and support the RJC for continued advocacy and influence.  Noah Formica, a grassroots leader with Turning Point Action in Pennsylvania, discussed the upcoming debate watch party at the Greater Philly Expo Center with Scott Pressler. He highlighted the event’s importance for rallying supporters and focusing on key issues for Pennsylvania voters. Formica hopes President Trump will emphasize his stance on oil and gas policies, gun rights, and his opposition to Kamala Harris’s proposed regulations. He also addressed concerns about voter integrity, noting that local GOPs are working to highlight issues with mail-in ballots and voter registration. Despite challenges, Formica reported a strong push to engage voters and improve mail-in ballot efforts, with notable progress in GOP requests compared to Democrats. He encouraged supporters to follow him on Twitter and engage with Turning Point Action through their website.

Mike Benz delivered a robust critique of the current political landscape, focusing particularly on President Joe Biden’s fitness for office, the influence of the intelligence community, and the broader implications for national security and foreign policy. Benz begins by discussing the uncertainty surrounding President Joe Biden’s political future, particularly his ability to remain in the presidential race. He metaphorically describes the political establishment’s search for a new leader: “The parasite is looking for a new host body.” Benz argues that Biden has been a long-serving member of the Washington power structure, often referred to as the “blob,” which includes the war industry, statecraft instruments, and intelligence community. These entities, he says, are looking for a new leader because they perceive Biden’s weakening condition as a liability. Benz highlights Biden’s long history within this establishment, stating, “Joe Biden has been a faithful servant for over 40 years to that blob class.” He emphasizes that Biden’s perceived frailty and his nickname “Mr. Foreign Policy” are now sources of concern. The intelligence community’s silence on Biden’s cognitive abilities is particularly striking to Benz, who points out, “The commander-in-chief cannot keep his eyes open past 4 PM, and when the clock strikes about nine or ten, he turns into effectively a total vegetable.” Benz underscores the critical role of a cogent president in handling national security emergencies. He questions Biden’s ability to make timely decisions: “National Security emergencies happen every week in some country, in somewhere, there are issues of grave concern to the CIA, to the Pentagon, to the State Department.” He stresses that Biden’s incapacities could compromise America’s ability to respond effectively to such crises. According to Benz, the Democratic Party faces a significant challenge in finding a suitable replacement for Biden. He believes that many potential candidates lack the necessary foreign policy experience: “The Democrat Party has a lot of folks who are focused on domestic priorities… and who are simply not as well-versed in the secrets of the American Empire.” He mentions Kamala Harris as a potential candidate but notes her relative inexperience compared to Biden. He also suggests that Hillary Clinton could be a suitable replacement due to her extensive knowledge of foreign policy. Benz told show host Natalie Winters, that he finds it fascinating that Hunter Biden is now involved in high-level White House meetings. This involvement contradicts previous claims that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden’s activities were separate. Benz states, “Hunter Biden is effectively acting as his proxy, teleporting into the West Wing to directly participate in essentially presidential matters.” He views Hunter Biden’s involvement as an extension of his father’s deep ties to the intelligence community and foreign dealings. Benz also highlights the influence of Mike Donilon, a long-time advisor to Joe Biden, whose brother Tom Donilon is the chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. Benz argues that this relationship underscores the intricate connections between political, intelligence, and financial institutions in the U.S. He describes Biden as a “BlackRock president” serving both corporate and intelligence interests. Benz turned his attention to USAID, describing it as a “CIA front” rather than a mere charity organization. He recounts various instances where USAID has been involved in covert operations, such as creating a Twitter knockoff app in Cuba to incite revolt and running fake aid clinics in Colombia and Venezuela for paramilitary activities. Benz emphasizes that USAID’s inclusion in the National Security Council solidifies its role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. Benz’s commentary paints a picture of a political and intelligence landscape fraught with complex relationships and hidden agendas. He raises critical questions about Joe Biden’s capacity to lead and the broader implications for U.S. national security. Benz’s analysis suggests that searching for a new leader within the Democratic Party is not just a political maneuver but a strategic necessity for maintaining the current power structure.

In a Saturday WarRoom conversation from Harvard University with Steve Bannon, Ambassador Carla Sands outlined bold steps to revolutionize U.S. foreign policy, cut unnecessary aid, and prepare for a new strategic relationship with Greenland. The discussion, which spanned topics ranging from government corruption to international defense, highlighted Sands’ firm stance on "America First” policies and the country’s national security strategy.
"We’re creating a revolution here at Harvard and across the country, and it’s going to change our nation,” Sands declared.
"This is about America First, and the money will change the money.” Sands emphasized that U.S. taxpayer dollars, often funneled into Ivy League institutions like Harvard and Penn, would no longer serve as a vehicle for bureaucratic corruption. She particularly praised the work of Professor Amy Wax, who has called for reforms using Title VI to examine and address the misuse of federal funds by universities. Sands believes the Department of Education will play a key role in uncovering these financial webs, ultimately redirecting funding to benefit the American people rather than maintaining bloated administrations.
"Corruption, the tens of billions of dollars that are going to places like Penn and Harvard from the federal government, this is all going to change,” Sands affirmed. "We’re going to turn off the money and then we’re going to turn on money that benefits the American people.”
As a former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark, Sands’ extensive knowledge of international relations was evident when discussing the importance of defense in the Arctic region, particularly regarding Greenland. Sands has been a vocal advocate for strengthening U.S. strategic positions in the Arctic, which she describes as a “great power struggle” for the 21st century. She explained that during her tenure, the U.S. had limited defense capabilities in the area, despite the growing military presence of Russia.
"We were outgunned in the Arctic. Russia has around 50 icebreakers, they have missiles on them,” Sands noted. "We have two icebreakers, and one doesn’t always work.” Sands emphasized the strategic importance of Greenland, which is located just off the U.S. Northeast Coast. "Greenland is a third of the size of the continental U.S.,” she explained, "undefended by Denmark and undefended by the U.S.”
A significant topic in the conversation was China’s growing presence in the Arctic, with the CCP laying claim to nearly 40% of the region under the guise of their "Polar Silk Road.” Sands pointed out that while China’s ambitions in the Arctic are clear, the U.S. must assert its presence to maintain its regional role. "We have to be up there,” Sands stated, "because the strategic nature of the Arctic is critical to our national defense.”
Sands’ remarks also touched on the evolving political landscape of Greenland, which she revealed is moving towards potential independence from Denmark—this shift, which Sands attributes to the influence of President Trump’s election. "Greenland is going independent,” Sands stated. "The Premier said about three weeks ago that they’re going independent. That’s a big deal.”
The independence movement is tied to the region’s untapped natural resources, with Sands citing how Denmark has underdeveloped Greenland. The lack of infrastructure and economic development has left Greenland dependent on Denmark’s annual welfare payments. Sands believes that the U.S. can offer the support Greenland needs regarding mining, energy development, and military defense.
While discussing the broader U.S. policy under President Trump’s administration, Sands was enthusiastic about the rapid pace of executive actions and reforms. "Every day’s Christmas,” she said with excitement. "I can’t wait every day, and it doesn’t stop at five o’clock. No, it continues on the weekends. It’s the most exciting political time in my lifetime.”
Sands also addressed the resistance from the media and the left, particularly regarding court challenges to President Trump’s policies. She suggested that reforms should be made to limit the power of individual federal judges who may hinder the president’s ability to carry out his agenda. "I think the judges have to be reined in,” she argued. "The president won the popular vote, he won the Electoral College vote, and the people are behind him.”
About her role, Sands made it clear that she remains committed to serving in whatever capacity President Trump deems necessary. "I’ll do whatever he needs me to do,” she stated. "This is the most exciting time in my life.”
As a prominent figure in U.S. foreign policy, Ambassador Carla Sands’s perspective reflects a powerful commitment to reshaping international relations, strengthening U.S. national defense, and ensuring American taxpayers benefit from foreign investments. As the conversation unfolded, it became evident that her drive for reform remains unwavering at home and abroad.

Mike Davis commented on Wednesday’s WarRoom about Special Counsel Jack Smith and the broader legal and political battles facing the Trump campaign. During a discussion with Natalie Winters, Davis criticized Smith’s appointment and actions, highlighting constitutional issues. “Judge Eileen Cannon correctly ruled that Jack Smith’s appointment as a special counsel violated the Appointments Clause and the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution because the special counsel office was just made up,” Davis stated. He explained that the special counsel’s office, unlike the independent counsel office previously established by statute, lacks proper oversight and has an unlimited budget, making it unconstitutional. Davis expressed confidence that these constitutional issues won’t be resolved before the 2024 election despite Smith’s and the Biden administration’s appeals. “President Trump’s acting attorney general should dismiss these cases on day one, fire Jack Smith, and open an investigation into his weaponization of the Justice Department to go after Biden’s political enemies,” Davis asserted. He emphasized the need for accountability and justice, not retribution, as central to Trump’s potential second term. Davis recently delivered pointed remarks on Jack Smith’s legal maneuvers and the imperative for Republican unity in the face of what he perceives as a highly politicized Department of Justice. Davis, a frequent and outspoken guest on WarRoom, thoroughly critiqued Smith’s actions and highlighted the constitutional implications of the ongoing legal battles involving Trump. Davis argued that Judge Eileen Cannon’s decision to rule against Jack Smith’s appointment as Special Counsel was correct, citing constitutional violations. “Jack Smith’s appointment of a special counsel violated the Appointments Clause and the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution because the Special Counsel’s office was not created by statute, as required,” Davis explained. This critique underscores a broader concern about the unchecked power of such appointments, which Davis believes lacks the necessary oversight and legitimacy. He emphasized that the creation of the Special Counsel’s office was an overreach by the Department of Justice. “The Justice Department wanted to keep the ability to appoint special counsels without the constraints of statutory creation,” he said. According to Davis, this lack of day-to-day supervision by Senate-confirmed officers and an unlimited budget renders such positions unconstitutional. Davis also highlighted the timing of these legal maneuvers, suggesting they are politically motivated. “Jack Smith and the Biden Justice Department are going to appeal, but guess what? That’s not going to get resolved before the election,” he remarked. This timing, Davis suggested, is intended to keep President Trump embroiled in legal battles during a critical election period, thereby impacting his campaign. Furthermore, Davis called for President Trump to take decisive action if re-elected. “On January 20th, his acting Attorney General should dismiss these cases on day one, fire Jack Smith, and open an investigation into Smith’s weaponization of our Justice Department,” he declared. This statement reflects a broader sentiment among Trump’s supporters, who view these legal challenges as politically motivated attacks rather than legitimate prosecutions. In addition to his critique of Jack Smith, Davis stressed the importance of unity within the Republican Party to effectively combat what he views as systemic bias within the justice system. “We are a united and strong Republican party,” Davis asserted, contrasting this with his view of the Democrats as “divided and weak.” He argued that such unity is crucial for implementing a robust agenda and ensuring accountability.

Warroom News

Harvard Professor Amy Wax appeared on Saturday’s WarRoom. She heavily criticized the current state of academia, calling for the defunding of universities that violate civil rights laws and fail to honor the principles of Western Civilization. Wax exposed to host Steve Bannon how elites, while promoting equality, create double standards that harm ordinary people and weaken institutions critical to America’s future. She urges President Trump to act decisively and cut funding to institutions like the University of Pennsylvania, which continues to receive government money despite its ideological shift.
During the candid conversation,  Wax elevated the stark realities of academia today. “What’s more important than young people to the future of our country?” Wax said, pointing to the growing disconnection between elite universities and the needs of everyday Americans. She stresses how academia has betrayed its responsibility to expose students to the truth, regardless of how uncomfortable it might be.
Wax explains that, in her view, academic institutions have failed in their duty to preserve and pass down the principles of Western Civilization. "We have inherited wonderful, valuable institutions from the past… we have a duty to protect and defend them,” she says. This duty, Wax argues, is not only to honor the sacrifices of past generations but to pass on these institutions in good shape, ready to be handed down to future generations. Yet, Wax believes that this responsibility is being ignored as universities degrade the very institutions they were meant to protect.
According to Wax, the professors and leaders in these institutions are not fulfilling their duty. "I see in my fellow academics an unwillingness to go up against the powers that be,” she notes, referring to the growing influence of the far left within universities. She calls out the cowardice of these intellectuals who remain silent despite privately opposing the far-left agenda. Wax blames this culture for actively promoting ideas that undermine merit and embrace identity politics over competence. “They create a lax atmosphere that results in incompetence,” she says, emphasizing how policies like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) distort education.
Wax knows these institutions inside and out as someone who’s spent over 30 years in academia. "It happened gradually, and as Hemingway says, then suddenly,” she reflects. She notes how the far-left has seized control of the university system, consolidating power and pushing their ideology at the expense of traditional values. “The belief system is very far removed from most ordinary people,” she asserts, describing how elites have become increasingly disconnected from the realities of average Americans.
The conversation also touches on the ideological hypocrisy of the left. "You can just look around you in Cambridge and see this sort of posh, refined beautiful place that elite people have created for themselves,” Wax comments, referring to the affluent areas around Harvard. "Go 30 miles west of Philadelphia, outside my home, and you’ll see squalor, decrepitude, lack of law and order.” She contrasts the comfortable, sheltered lives of elites with the struggles faced by working-class Americans. The message is clear: while elites talk about diversity, they live in exclusive enclaves far removed from the issues affecting the broader population.
Bannon chimes in, agreeing with Wax’s assessment of the current state of academia. Together, they discuss how the two pillars of the far-left ideology—self-fashioning and equality of outcome—are reshaping education and society. Wax quotes Charles Murray’s Coming Apart, noting how the elite class has segregated itself from the rest of society, living in “wytopias” while touting diversity and equality for everyone else. This double standard, Wax insists, is what breeds resentment and disillusionment among the public.
The conversation concludes with a call to action. Wax urges President Trump to defund universities that violate civil rights laws, explicitly pointing to institutions like the University of Pennsylvania, which receives millions in federal funds. "Defund them,” she urges. "Play hardball. Make them focus on Western Civilization.” For Wax, the solution is simple: cut the money flow until universities prove they uphold the law and return to their original educational mission.
This bold stance against academia’s current trajectory highlights the urgency for reform. Wax and Bannon’s call for action is a powerful reminder of preserving the values that have shaped America, even as they are increasingly under threat.

President Joe Biden has slashed funding for a Department of Justice initiative aimed at combating digital crimes against children, War Room can reveal. The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program (ICAC) – the target of these cuts – is a national network of 61 coordinated task forces comprised of over 5,400 federal, state, and local law enforcement" dedicated to investigating, prosecuting and developing effective responses to internet crimes against children.” One of the key areas of focus is human trafficking in addition to the sexual exploitation of children. Despite operating as the leading entity combatting the sexual exploitation of children online, since President Joe Biden took office, the ICAC program has seen a reduction in its operating budget of millions of dollars. In the last fiscal year under President Donald Trump, the program’s budget totaled $34.73 million before seeing a slight decrease in fiscal year 2021, coinciding with Biden’s takeover of the White House, to $34.68 million. In the first full fiscal year under President Biden, the ICAC program budget was cut nearly $3.5 million to the newfound total of $31.2 million. The downward spending trend is at odds with the ever-increasing trajectory of online content containing child exploitation. As outlined in an analysis published by comparitech: "As we’ve already seen, in just nine months of 2022, Facebook had almost equaled 2021’s content removals for child exploitation. It was a similar story on Instagram (6.08 million pieces of content flagged from Q1-Q3 of 2022 compared to 8.38 million in 2021) and TikTok (140 million pieces of content flagged from Q1-Q3 of 2022 compared to 141.7 million in 2021). Snapchat looked set to surpass 2021’s total with 201,527 accounts flagged for child sexual exploitation and abuse in the first half of 2022, compared to 317,243 flagged across all of 2021. Whereas, Discord’s Q1-Q3 figures for 2022 had already exceeded 2021’s totals (1.52 million accounts, servers, and pieces of content were flagged from Q1-Q3 of 2022, compared to 1.42 million in 2021). LinkedIn’s figures saw a 636 percent increase. 226 pieces of child exploitation content were recorded by LinkedIn in 2021 compared to 1,663 in the first half of 2022 alone.” The curious budget decrease comes amidst the Biden White House also removing "international sex trafficking or minors,” "domestic sex trafficking of minors,” and "child prostitution” from a DOJ website highlighting the agency’s areas of concern.

Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur, a prominent champion for sending aid to Ukraine, serves as a Strategic Advisor to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, a lobbying group representing the interests of corporations including defense industry giants and the Ukrainian government. Rep. Kaptur and the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC) also have ties to Burisma, a controversial Ukrainian energy firm that paid President Joe Biden’s son Hunter received over $83,000 a month from to serve on its board. On the same day that Biden family business associate Devon Archer met with Rep. Kaptur’s office on behalf of his client Burisma in 2016, the USUBC held a joint event with Burisma focused on "Ukraine’s Energy Security Future.” Burisma was also previously a member of the USUBC. The USUBC, which describes itself as a "strong international voice for business in Ukraine now promoting U.S.-Ukraine business relations,” represents over 200 companies including leading defense firms such as Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin. Many of these members, therefore, are direct beneficiaries of the multi-billion-dollar aid packages authorized by the White House for Ukraine. Rep. Kaptur was one of 12 House lawmakers to press the White House to send Ukraine additional military aid, specifically F-16s. During recent debate over the potential passage of a Continuing Resolution, Rep. Kaptur also strongly advocated for including funds for Ukraine. In addition to being the co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, Rep. Kaptur is also the Ranking Member on the influential House Appropriations Subcommittee and serves on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Rep. Kaptur is also one of the council’s 20 Strategic Advisors, which War Room previously exposed for coordinating op-eds in mainstream news outlets calling for more assistance to Ukraine – even slamming the prospect of negotiations as "damaging and counterproductive.” The authors repeatedly failed to disclose their affiliation with USUBC. Rep. Kaptur, who has received the USUBC’s Distinguished Service Award, has a long track record of participating in events, webinars, and even visits to Ukraine on behalf of the council. Given her influential role in congress over appropriations, her ties to the USUBC appear to represent a sizable conflict of interest. Much of her work with the USUBC has focused on energy, including a webinar entitled “Moving United States-Ukraine Relations and Ukraine’s Economy and Energy Security Forward in 2020.” “Congresswoman Kaptur will bring opening remarks. Topics to be discussed by Congresswoman Kaptur will be expanding U.S-Ukraine relations, strengthening support for Ukraine in the U.S. Congress, ways to strengthen Ukraine’s business development especially in the area of energy independence and resilience with a focus on renewables: solar, biofuels (biodiesel, bioethanol), wind and LNG and other relevant issues,” explained a summary. The USUBC also posted a letter Rep. Kaptur sent to Volodymyr Zelensky in 2020 “urging [Zelensky’s] government to engage in negotiations with key industry players to ensure robust continued foreign investment.”  Documents obtained by the House Ways and Means Committee include an agenda for a March 2016 Washington, D.C. visit from Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer on behalf of Burisma. Rep. Kaptur was one of three representatives whose he met with on behalf of the Biden-linked Ukrainian energy firm. Additional documents obtained by the House Ways and Means Committee include memos detailing the services provided by Washington D.C.-based lobbying firm Blue Star Strategies on behalf of Burisma. Blue Star Strategies promised to “generate support” for Burisma from entities including the USUBC. These promises appeared to materialize, as the same day Devon Archer met with Rep. Kaptur’s office, the USUBC and Burisma held a joint presentation. As reported by the Kyiv Post: “The topic of the event this year was "Ukraine’s Energy Security Future”, where the President of the US-Ukraine Business Council Morgan Williams and Vadym Pozharskyi introduced the model for Ukraine’s energy sector development and shared expectations on reform and deregulation of the energy sector, the country’s strategic industry. The USUBC has more than 200 member-companies, with 100 being the largest foreign investors in Ukrainian economy. According to the Advisor to the Board of Directors at Burisma Holdings Vadym Pozharskyi, the company also conducted series of meetings with Offices of US Senators – Rob Portman, Jeanne Shaheen, Marcy Kaptur and their advisors on energy issues and international relations in order to brief on current situation in the area of energy security, oil & gas market reforms and future development of Ukrainian gas market. Prior to the Washington meetings, the USUBC held roundtable discussions in Kyiv with the United States Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt and Minister of Finance of Ukraine Natalie Yaresko, where businesses operating in Ukraine outlined their expectations.” Vadym Pozharskyi, the Burisma executive who met with then-Vice President Joe Biden and appears frequently in Hunter Biden’s emails, participated in additional USUBC events such as a roundtable with Ukraine’s Minister of Finance on “the critical reform, budget, tax, financial and other key issues facing Ukraine.” Photos obtained from the now-deleted Burisma website show that former U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch attended two meetings hosted by the USUBC in Kyiv with Pozharskyi. Blue Star Strategies has been under investigation by the Justice Department for unregistered foreign lobbying to boost the public image of Ukraine-based energy company Burisma Holdings in November 2015. During that time, Hunter Biden served on Burisma’s board, collecting sizable retainer fees. Emails obtained from the “hard drive from hell” appear to show Hunter Biden playing a crucial role in the scandal-plagued energy firm’s decision to proceed with hiring Blue Star Strategies. Hunter Biden told Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi: “Let me have one final call with them and verify once more that they understand the scope so we can all feel the retainer is in line with the work required. I trust [Blue Star co-founder] Sally [Painter] and Karen implicitly so I believe we are all aligned but I want to have one last conversation with them to confirm before we proceed.” Two days later, Hunter reiterated in an email to Pozharskyi that “[Fellow Burisma board member] Devon [Archer] and I do feel comfortable with BS [Blue Star] and the ability of Sally & Karen to deliver … Looking forward to getting started on this.” Since first publicizing Rep. Kaptur’s ties to the USUBC on Twitter, War Room co-host Natalie Winters was attacked as “Putin’s pawn” by the Congresswoman.

The Department of Health and Human Services has begun rolling out federal contracts for “COVID-19 response” with start dates scheduled in September and concluding in the year 2025, War Room can reveal. The unearthed contracts, which can be viewed on the federal government’s spending database, follow a separate War Room exclusive detailing similar behavior from the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has inked a contract with the Virginia-based Goldbelt Apex, which is active in the health information technology space. Among its areas of focus are “coordination of response to public health emergencies” and “surveillance.” The contract, which is set to begin on the future date of September 17th, 2023, is reportedly for “program management office supporting initiatives that strengthen COVID-19 response and address emerging public health emergencies,” according to a synopsis. The contract is currently worth $1,816,071.23 but could potentially be raised to $4,156,434.07 by its potential end date of March 16th, 2025. The unearthed contracts follow the mainstream media hyping an alleged surge in COVID-19 cases across America, which also dovetails with COVID-19 vaccine makers such as Pfizer experiencing a rapid decline in profits.

Republican National Committee Chairmen and Treasurers have met with officials from the Chinese Communist Party and its vast network of foreign influence groups to discuss “campaign strategies” and the direction of U.S.-China relations for over a decade, War Room can reveal. Among the newly revealed participants is Treasurer Anthony Duncan, who held the influential position under the tenure of Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel while attending the Beijing-based event in 2017. Evidenced through a decades-long trove of documents, War Room can reveal the identities of several RNC Chairmen and Treasurers who participated in several versions of an annual event – the U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue – alongside members of the Chinese Communist Party. Despite this apparent national security threat, the following RNC Leaders have participated in the U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue: Former Chairman Ed Gillespie; Former RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson; Former RNC Treasurer Anthony Parker; and Former RNC Chairman Robert Duncan. Additionally, brochures obtained from the 2016 edition of the the U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue reveal that the then-RNC-Treasurer Tony Parker attended to “discuss campaign strategies and prospects for U.S.-China relations under the new Trump administration.” As the documents recount: “Following the CPC dialogue with the bipartisan U.S. delegation, the EastWest Institute also facilitated meetings for the CPC with senior Republican officials—former Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Mike Duncan, current RNC treasurer Tony Parker and United States Economic and Security Review Commissioner Dan Slane—to further discuss campaign strategies and prospects for U.S.-China relations under the new Trump administration.” Former Treasurer Anthony Parker also participated in the dialogues while he was actively serving as the treasurer of the RNC, including during the 2016 election and continued to do so when Ronna Romney McDaniel took over as Chairwoman. What’s more, the U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue is put on with the support of Chinese foreign influence groups belonging to the regime’s United Front Work Department. The United Front Work Department is a billion-dollar political warfare operation executed by the Chinese Communist Party seeking "to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party” and "influence foreign individuals and the policies of foreign states to serve Beijing’s interests,” according to the federal U.S.-China Security and Economic Review Commission. The U.S. State Department also compares the United Front to the China’s "magic weapon” to get willing Americans to push policies advantageous to the Chinese Communist Party. The U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue is a project of the East West Institute and China United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) in partnership with International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. CUSEF is one of Beijing’s premier United Front Work Department influence groups, which frequently takes American elites on all-expenses-paid trips to China in exchange for favors, such as “favorable coverage” from the mainstream media. This tactic appears to have been used against RNC leadership, too, with many of these U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogues taking places overseas in China. The dialogues began in 2010 but saw participation from RNC officials for the first time in 2013. “The most significant evolution of the process occurred in 2013, when we reached out to the Democratic and Republican Parties and invited sitting DNC and RNC officers to take part in the dialogue for the first time. Whereas in earlier convenings, we had featured prominent Democratic and Republican former statesmen, governors and legislators, as well as former DNC and RNC chairs, now we were also involving sitting DNC and RNC leaders and that added a new element to the talks,” explains the East West Institute in a blog post. Former RNC Chairman Mike Duncan participated in the 3rd and 4th U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue, with colleagues including Former RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson and then-Treasurer Anthony Parker joining in 2015 and 2014, as pictured below. Brochures obtained from the 2016 edition of the the U.S.-China High-Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue reveal that the then-RNC-Treasurer Tony Parker attended to “discuss campaign strategies and prospects for U.S.-China relations under the new Trump administration.” As the documents recount: “Following the CPC dialogue with the bipartisan U.S. delegation, the EastWest Institute also facilitated meetings for the CPC with senior Republican officials—former Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Mike Duncan, current RNC treasurer Tony Parker and United States Economic and Security Review Commissioner Dan Slane—to further discuss campaign strategies and prospects for U.S.-China relations under the new Trump administration.” “The propitious timing of the dialogue facilitated candid exchange and valuable insights into the outcome and future implications of the November 8, 2016 U.S. elections, prospective governing priorities of the Trump administration, and the outcomes of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee,” added a synopsis of the event. These bombshell findings come amidst criticism of the Republican National Committee (RNC) as “controlled opposition” for its refusal to back America First candidates with tough stances against the Chinese Communist Party.

The Carter Center will deploy “nonpartisan election observers” in Fulton County, Georgia for the upcoming midterms The group is also combatting election “misinformation” in states including Arizona, insisting there is “no evidence of fraud” It has a long track record of working with Chinese Communist Party-funded influence groups The Carter Center is partnered with the Chinese Communist Party on election oversight in China Other prominent partners of the Carter Center include Pfizer Inc., The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and George Soros’s Open Society Foundation THE CARTER CENTER, which is partnered with several Chinese Communist Party-funded foreign influence groups, is dispatching “nonpartisan” election observers and sponsoring initiatives to combat election “misinformation” for the Nov. 8 midterms, War Room can reveal. The center, founded by its namesake, former president Jimmy Carter, has also signed agreements with the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Ministry of Civil Affairs to cooperate on administering elections in China and has invited CCP officials overseas to observe elections in the U.S. The Carter Center’s ample ties to Beijing have been repeatedly flagged by U.S. lawmakers, as it has worked with several groups operating under China’s “United Front.” A multi-billion-dollar political warfare operation, the United Front has been described by former CCP Chairman Mao Zedong as a “magic weapon” to ensure communism’s victory over democracy. American officials have also identified the effort as working to “co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition” and “influence foreign governments to take actions or adopt positions supportive of Beijing.” ELECTION WARFARE While maintaining these compromising ties, one of the primary operations of the Carter Center has been conducting “election observation” missions for over 100 elections across 39 countries. Since 2020, it has pledged to carry out similar operations in the U.S. “The Carter Center has been working to support elections at home by providing objective information about the election process and advancing good practices in transparency,” outlines the center before noting “our efforts have expanded in 2022 and will continue to grow in the run-up to 2024.” Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Florida, and North Carolina are the primary states of interest for the Carter Center. For example, the Carter Center was recently selected by Georgia’s Fulton County Board of Elections and the Performance Review Board to send “nonpartisan election observers” to oversee the upcoming Nov. 8 midterms. Fulton County, which includes the city of Atlanta, was reportedly a hotbed of voter fraud during the 2020 election. The Carter Center will be responsible for “absentee ballot issuance and processing; early voting and election day polling places; election day operations in the elections office; and post-election procedures” in the controversial county, according to a press release. The Carter Center’s unearthed efforts to influence the upcoming midterm elections follow the group playing a leading role in monitoring the audit of Georgia’s election results in 2020. In 2020, the center worked on an election security task force for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office as the sole “nonpartisan” observer for the audit. The Carter Center is also conducting operations in Arizona, recently launching the Arizona Democracy Resilience Network to suppress discussion of voter fraud among candidates and combat election “misinformation.” Among the group’s demands are that candidates “cooperate with elections officials” and “avoid spreading falsehoods.” “When you have candidates talking about fraud when there’s really been no evidence of fraud and fraud before an election is even held, it presents the kind of atmosphere out there that can lead to things down the road that you just don’t want to see happen,” explained Arizona Democracy Resilience Network co-director Don Henninger. The Arizona Democracy Resilience Network has identified Maricopa and Pima counties as its primary targets, both of which were believed to have been plagued with extensive voter fraud during the 2020 election. In an effort to boost confidence in the security of Arizona’s elections, which will be administered by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs, the Carter Center’s group is sponsoring statewide events such as “Follow the Ballot: Be Confident Your Vote Is Counted” to undercut claims of voter fraud. In addition to its Arizona and Georgia operations, the Carter Center is also behind the North Carolina Network for Fair, Safe, and Secure Elections, which is sponsoring a state-wide “Trusted Elections” tour. The group is also set to launch a similar campaign in Florida and has pledged to deploy “non-partisan election observers” in Michigan. CCP SELLOUTS The Carter Center’s newfound interest in influencing American elections, however, follows decades of collaboration with the CCP and its foreign influence operations conducted through “United Front” groups. Since 2012, the Carter Center has worked alongside the China United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), which was founded by the Vice-Chairman of the United Front’s oversight department. CUSEF has previously sponsored trips to China for American journalists and former congressmen in exchange for “favorable coverage,” as revealed by Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) filings. The Carter Center, which has accepted funds from CUSEF, has sponsored a host of dialogues and events with the controversial group, providing a platform to argue fo increasing ties between America and the CCP. The center also retains links to the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which has been dubbed the “public face” of the United Front and flagged by the U.S. State Department for its campaigns to “directly and malignly influence” American officials. Other United Front groups that the Carter Center has collaborated with include the Chinese People’s Association for Peace and Disarmament, the Center for China and Globalization, and the U.S.-China Heartland Association, which explicitly targets American farmers and farmland. The Carter Center has also hosted events alongside the China Research Center (CRC), which is financially supported by Confucius Institutes. Confucius Institutes have been described by Chinese government officials as “an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up” and are notoriously rife with intellectual property theft and espionage. FOREIGN ELECTION INTERFERENCE? The Carter Center’s ties to the CCP run deeper, as it signed a memorandum of understanding with the regime’s Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1998 to collaborate on various election matters in China at the village and township level. The Carter Center, which was the first foreign organization allowed to observe elections above the village level in China, has published extensive reports on the CCP’s elections, routinely failing to offer any harsh criticism of the regime’s electoral manipulation and intimidation. “In those villages which we saw and heard about, the basic norms of a democratic election have been conveyed and are being implemented,” explained one report. Under the memorandum, the Carter Center worked with the CCP’s Ministry of Civil Affairs “to set up a computer network system for election data gathering; to standardize electoral procedures; to design and organize training sessions of election officials; and to promote exchanges between China and the United States on election observations and researches on election-related topics,” according to a synopsis of the agreement. “All Carter Center programming is done in consultation with Chinese government agencies and designed to deepen reform measures on the government agenda,” it adds. The memorandum also led to the Carter Center hosting delegations of CCP officials visiting the U.S. to observe elections in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2006. Déjà Vu Blue? Beyond its Chinese Communist Party ties, the group’s expansion into American elections has been met with considerable pushback due to its apparent left-wing political bias. Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, attacked President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election, insisting four more years of his presidency would be a “disaster.” Other partners of the Carter Center include Pfizer Inc., George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Health Organization. The news also follows controversy over hundreds of millions of dollars flowing from left-wing donors, most notably Mark Zuckerberg, into activist groups exploiting vote-by-mail.

In his recent critique of the WarRoom in the Kyiv post, “The Enemy Within the US Is Letting Russia Get Away With Murder,” Askold S. Lozynskyj aims at Steve Bannon, sparking a clash over who will be investigated for wrongdoing over Ukraine funding, Americans or Ukrainians. The WarRoom program, hosted by Bannon and his co-host Natalie Winters, is to many Americans a remnant beacon of liberty and hope and their final opportunity to defend what remains of a Constitutional Republic. To others, the WarRoom program is nothing more than a danger to the New World Order. “You are described in the article as an extremist and a criminal; Steve and I was overjoyed because that means that the momentum you are pushing is taking effect,” said Ben Harnwell, the WarRoom international editor, addressing the article on the Saturday program. Bannon responded and rebuffed the attacks from the Kyiv Post, saying that the author and the oligarchs in Ukraine can “stick it where the sun doesn’t shine.” Bannon and his persistent audience on the WarRoom staunchly oppose using American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukraine war. This bold stance has led Lozynskyj to brand Bannon a “criminal” and suggest US Reps should be investigated for their opposition to sending more money to Ukraine, saying it is somehow unAmerican to oppose the wealth transfer. What is evident from the article, according to Harnwell,  is that Bannon and the War Room, who even have their own activism tools for opposing Ukraine spending, are now openly feared internationally as political powerhouses. This week, Bannon’s mission remains unwavering as the WarRoom resolutely opposes the US House allocating an additional $61 billion to Ukraine. Bannon asserts that the WarRoom action is unsettling war profiteers who are misusing funds for luxuries and that criticism is evident in the sharp personal attacks launched by media outlets as a consequence. Thus, the Kyiv Post article exposes the government-media alliance that Bannon is legendary for exposing in the US. Despite the nasty Kyiv criticism, Bannon remains steadfast in his commitment to addressing the Ukrainian situation. He emphasizes accountability for how American taxpayer money is spent. The WarRoom host vows that once back in power, there will be a thorough investigation into the allocation of funds, hinting at potential criminal charges for those involved. Bannon says the investigations will also sweep up the country’s president and oligarchs. On Saturday, Harnwell, highlighted the disconnect between Bannon’s loyalty to the America First agenda and the accusations levied against him. Harnwell argues that the focus should remain on prioritizing American interests over external needs and wants, even for the author who was born in the US, as Harnwell points out. Lozynskyj’s criticism includes US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he depicts as obstructing efforts to combat Russian aggression. The article suggests investigating Greene and US Senator JD Vance for their opposition to funding Ukraine, portraying them as hindrances to American interests. Those Americans who are skeptical of funding foreign wars are labeled “Putin’s useful idiots,” insinuating that their actions align with Moscow’s agenda rather than America’s. As the political debate over Ukraine funding rages on, Bannon, the WarRoom, and their supporters will likely remain steadfast in their resistance to spreading taxpayer funds to the region, challenging the DC status quo, and advocating for American interests, regardless of the criticism they face from the Kyiv Post.

The daughter left Twitter earlier this year, but is now working for an NGO to advise state governments on Covid policy.

“War Room” executive editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about the dangerous relationship between the American media and the Chinese Communist Party, using an article in Politico by Jon Bateman as Exhibit A. “This article is titled ‘The Fevered Anti-China Attitude in Washington Is Going to Backfire.’ Even thought the byline says it is by Jon Bateman, it very well could have been authored by the Chinese Communist Party…. The talking points that run through it are straight from Beijing…. What’s so interesting is … this is a perfect example of how the Chinese Communist Party really launders their talking points through American talking heads.”

The timing of Dr. Luft’s indictment following revealing Biden family criminal behavior follows a patten of judicial weaponization to shield the Biden Family. Winters calls the indictment "a classic case of accusing your enemy of what you are guilty of” as Luft is accused of failing to register as a foreign agent for work with China. The indictment cites Dr. Luft’s work with CEFC the same energy company the Biden family has been accused of laundering money through.

Natalie Winters talks about the Atlantic magazine article that says “Let’s Declare a Pandemic Amnesty,” as a way to forgive and forget the horrid decision-making of U.S. politicians whose policies destroyed the economy, ravaged children’s education and killed some thousands of innocent victims. “It kind of represents the establishment coming to terms with the fact that there are going to be investigations held by Republicans when we take back the House and Senate… There’s an italicized part of the article … where the author really encapsulated what she’s trying to get across with the piece. And she says, ‘We didn’t know’ and she’s talking about the efficacy of masks with children, and I think that just stands at such odds with the slogan of ‘Trust the Experts” and ‘Trust the Science’ that have been beaten down our threats for years…. These so-called experts were never really experts from the beginning.”

Steve Bannon made a notable return to his alma mater, Harvard University, to deliver a keynote speech at a conference sponsored bySalient magazine.Bannon took the opportunity to host Saturday’s WarRoom program at the magazine’s offices in Harvard Square,  where he brought together students and conservative thinkers to discuss the shifting dynamics in American academia, particularly concerning conservative values in elite institutions.

During the opening show segment, Bannon expressed his excitement about returning to Harvard Square, and he praised Salient for its role in the conference, which featured past notable conservative speakers aiming to promote conservative thought within the university. He also acknowledged Harvard’s conservative-leaning students, notably those affiliated with the John Adams Society, who have seen a shift from traditional conservatism to a more vigorous “MAGA” ideology.
During the Saturday program with his guest Ambassador Carla Sands and Harvard Professor Amy Wax, Bannon discussed the broader “revolution” underway at Harvard, specifically the movement challenging the university’s financial ties to federal funding. During their conversations, Bannon criticized the massive amounts of taxpayer money that flow into prestigious institutions like Harvard. He argued that these funds enable systemic corruption and left-wing agendas, calling for a cut-off of federal funding and redirecting resources to initiatives that directly benefit the American people.

Bannon highlighted that the "America First” ideology behind the successful Populist movement is now making its way into the heart of academia. He remarked, "This revolution is gaining momentum at Harvard and across the country. We need to challenge the left-wing dominance in these universities.”
In his discussion with Salient students Sam Delmer and Kimo Gandall, Bannon pointed out the growing influence of the MAGA movement at Harvard, especially among undergraduates. Delmer shared his experiences, explaining how a shift in conservative student groups has led to a more radical, MAGA-influenced ideology. "It’s not just the professional schools like the law school or business school; it’s happening at the college level too. Even new freshmen are coming in with strong MAGA views,” Delmer noted.

Bannon responded to Delmer’s assessment by explaining his view of MAGA as a broad, inclusive movement to push the right further. "MAGA is about creating a Vanguard that continues to push things to the right,” Bannon said. "It’s about opening up the Overton window on the right so we can have real intellectual discussions about our country’s problems.”
The conference, which included appearances by figures like Peter Thiel and Professor Amy Wax, sought to engage students in more profound political discourse. It provided a platform for the new conservative movement, hoping to educate those at the political center about conservatism’s values.
Bannon’s WarRoom interviews from Harvard and speech are sure to be significant moments in the ongoing debate about the role of academia in shaping political ideologies. Bannon’s return to Harvard shows his belief in the potential of a student-led revolution, where conservative ideas, particularly the MAGA vision, take root in America’s top universities.

Steve Bannon wastes no time responding to the latest DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency)  shake-up. Following Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s announcement that theDepartment of Defense (DoD) will undergo a full-scale audit, Bannon took toWarRoomon Friday to emphasize the urgency of DOGE leader Elon Musk, tackling government waste starting right now—and starting with the military budget.
"You’re not going to fix everything overnight, but you’ve got to get south of the Potomac to get over there and start looking now. That’s where you’re going to find opportunities to actually cut spending,” Bannon said, with his eyes on government contractors.
Bannon, who has spent the week urging Musk to scrutinize Pentagon spending, sees the DoD audit as a pivotal moment for budget reform. Speaking with WarRoom host Dave Brat on the Friday afternoon show, he emphasized that cutting Pentagon spending is crucial to the broader fiscal responsibility he has long championed as a cornerstone of President Trump’s America First agenda.
But Musk seemed to be dragging his feet about getting out of USAID and over to the Pentagon.
The advice from Bannon was clear: serious budget reform starts with the DoD. Bannon’s push for Musk’s involvement signals a significant shift in how the incoming Trump administration plans to handle military spending. "This is the fight,” Bannon declared, "you want to cut discretionary spending? You want to get control of Social Security and Medicare? First, you’ve got to tackle the Pentagon,” he added.
Watch the conversation from Friday’s WarRoom:
Jack Posobiec On Cutting Government Spending At The DOD: "Get The Rot Out"@JackPosobiecpic.twitter.com/by1ApUGAlp
— Bannon’s WarRoom (@Bannons_WarRoom)February 7, 2025
Hegseth commented on Friday afternoon that President Trump had authorized a full audit of his department.
"We are going to focus heavily to ensure that at a bare minimum, by the end of four years, the Pentagon passes a clean audit,” Hegseth stated, setting the stage for what could be the most thorough financial examination of the DoD in history,” Hegseth told his military audience.
Bannon has praised Musk’s efforts so far, particularly his work exposing corruption in USAID, calling it "fantastic.” However, he has urged Musk to go further—shifting his focus to cutting government spending, starting with the military. While supportive of DOGE’s efforts, Bannon believes deeper reforms are needed.
Bannon’s urgency stems from the approaching March 14 budget deadline, where he sees little political will to make real spending cuts. With a government shutdown or another continuing resolution (CR) looming, Bannon has warned that Washington will once again kick the can down the road without serious action.
Watch these comments from Bannon from earlier on Friday about those concerns:
Steve Bannon: "There Is No Political Will To Cut Federal Spending.”pic.twitter.com/qIxeuUNwCL
— Bannon’s WarRoom (@Bannons_WarRoom)February 7, 2025
"Elon’s been avoiding this because it’s massive,” Bannon said on Friday about why he believes Musk is avoiding the defense budget.
"That is where the real corruption and incompetence are baked into the system. The Pentagon is theMack Daddyof government waste,”Bannon said.
Bannon emphasized again that Musk must now "cross the Potomac” and bring his expertise to uncover inefficiencies and unnecessary expenditures that have long plagued the departments at the Pentagon.
With a $2 trillion deficit already embedded in the budget, Bannon warned the WarRoom audience that Democrats are maneuvering to force Trump into a government shutdown. "They’re digging in for the March 14 deadline,” he explained. "They want to back Trump into a corner. If we’re serious about cutting spending, we have to start with the Pentagon.”
Jack Posobiec, a frequentWarRoomguest, chimed in on the discussion, calling the Pentagon’s budget "a jobs program” that benefits career bureaucrats and politicians.
"A lot of depots could be shut down, but they’re tied to every congressman’s job numbers and political performance,” Posobiec told Brat.
Posobiec also pointed to top-ranking military officials prioritizing "woke policies” over national defense, contributing to inefficiency and mission drift.
Bannon agreed, reinforcing that Trump’s strategy is a necessary first step. "We’ve got Pete Hegseth over there reinstilling the warrior ethos and fighting spirit. Now, Elon’s got to get in there with his team and start cutting the fat. This isn’t about weakening national security—it’s about eliminating waste.”
With the audit officially underway and Musk now in the mix at the Pentagon addressing government contracts, all eyes will be on how deep this financial review goes—and whether it results in actual cuts to Washington’s entrenched spending habits.

Steve Bannon, a top former aide to President Donald J. Trump and the host of the top-rated Podcast (also seen on Real America’s Voice), “Bannon’s WarRoom“-after a Thursday court appearance- spoke to the media and affirmed his firm belief in his legal team and their preparedness to escalate his case over a contempt of Congress charge to the Supreme Court if needed. Co-host of the WarRoom, Natalie Winters, set the scene on a Thursday Broadcast: Outside the courthouse, Bannon sharply criticized the Justice Department, accusing officials like Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco of attempting to silence the MAGA movement and Conservative grassroots conservatives. “They’re not going to shut up Trump, they’re not going to shut up Navarro, they’re not going to shut up Bannon, and they’re certainly not going to shut up MAGA,” Bannon asserted. In the latest developments, a federal judge revoked Bannon’s bail and ordered him to report to prison by July 1 for his contempt of Congress conviction. Bannon was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $6,500 for defying a subpoena during the January 6 Capitol attack investigation. Despite a D.C. Circuit Court panel unanimously rejecting his appeal, Bannon’s lawyer argued that imprisonment was unjust. However, the judge determined that there was no substantial legal question to justify Bannon’s continued freedom. Bannon’s defiance remained evident as he highlighted the growing strength of the MAGA movement, confidently stating that if an election were held today, “President Trump would win in a landslide.” He emphasized their resolve to prevail in court and the upcoming elections. “We are going to win this; we’re going to win this at the Supreme Court,” he declared, projecting a significant victory for Trump and MAGA. Bannon’s comments further his support for the America First agenda and the MAGA movement’s momentum and resilience against historic lawfare in the political arena. Bannon stressed his team’s dedication to combating what appears to be highly unjust actions by the Justice Department. “All of this is about one thing,” Bannon said, “This is about shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.” With a resolute message of confidence and defiance, Bannon concluded, “There’s nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There’s not a prison built that can keep me in. All victory to MAGA.”  Watch: BANNON: All of this is about one thing—shutting down the MAGA movement, grassroots conservatives and Pres Trump.

 Bannon starts by taking aim at MSNBC, which he accuses of failing to recognize the power behind the populist movement. He says, "They’re lazy,” alleging that the media overlooks the coalition of people working behind the scenes to drive major victories. For Bannon, media bias is a critical issue because it keeps Americans in the dark about who’s influencing national policies. He believes that true transparency is only possible when media platforms acknowledge the depth and range of populist voices involved. Bannon notes that figures like Bill Ackman and David Sacks have been vital in supporting the populist agenda, adding, "We probably have 20 to 30 people.” This coalition includes veterans from diverse political backgrounds, who, according to Bannon, have left behind their progressive roots to rally around a nationalist vision. Why It Matters: This coalition, Bannon believes, has the potential to secure a long-term political realignment, especially with the support of Hispanics and working-class Americans. He sees these alliances as essential to building a majority capable of reshaping the government for decades to come. Bannon’s stance on immigration reform is straightforward and controversial: mass deportations. He argues that tackling undocumented immigration head-on will be a key action plan under a future populist government. "We’re going to have deals with countries, but we must focus,” Bannon says, describing a targeted approach to deportations. Why It Matters: Bannon views this policy as essential to securing American jobs and stabilizing the country’s social structure. He believes failure to act will leave working-class Americans at a disadvantage and risks cultural dilution, which he sees as damaging to America’s identity. In classic Bannon style, he stresses the need for "precision” and "accountability” in dealing with federal agencies, playfully emphasizing with his iconic, "Number 2 pencil, folks!” Bannon wants listeners to understand that this is serious business. He envisions a "reckoning” for federal agencies, arguing they’ve lost the trust of the American people and need reform. Why It Matters: Accountability, Bannon says, will restore faith in the government and empower the average citizen. This "reckoning” would reshape federal operations and, in Bannon’s view, return power to the states and the people. Bannon emphasizes states’ rights, citing the 10th Amendment as a cornerstone of his plan. "We believe in states’ rights,” he says, referencing Trump’s position on issues like abortion, where the states are given more control. Why It Matters: Bannon’s call for devolving power back to the states is a clear effort to decentralize federal authority. This would give states the right to enact policies reflecting their constituents’ values, providing more local control on controversial issues. In a surprising twist, Bannon claims the 2028 Democratic primary has already kicked off, with governors like Pritzker, Whitmer, and Newsom as likely contenders. He describes an emerging "firestorm” as Democratic governors prepare to challenge Trump’s policies head-on, especially on issues like immigration. Why It Matters: Bannon sees these governors as key players in a looming showdown between populist forces and progressive state leaders. Their involvement, he believes, could set the stage for a defining cultural and political battle in the next decade. Finally, Bannon hints that the political landscape is shifting beyond traditional divides. Gender issues, he argues, are becoming the "big thing,” potentially eclipsing racial tensions. He refers to a grassroots "TikTok movement” that played a role in the midterms and predicts this trend will continue. Why It Matters: Bannon believes this shift reflects a broader cultural clash, with young people mobilizing in new ways. Understanding these dynamics, he says, is key to recognizing where populist and nationalist efforts need to focus next. Bannon’s Saturday WarRoom commentary offers a vision he hopes will guide America’s political future. From media bias to immigration reform and federal accountability, his goals are ambitious and polarizing. The stakes, Bannon argues, are high, but his message is clear: if America is to be reshaped, it requires a coalition, strategic planning, and, of course, a "Number 2 pencil” level of precision.

 Bannon starts by taking aim at MSNBC, which he accuses of failing to recognize the power behind the populist movement. He says, "They’re lazy,” alleging that the media overlooks the coalition of people working behind the scenes to drive major victories. For Bannon, media bias is a critical issue because it keeps Americans in the dark about who’s influencing national policies. He believes that true transparency is only possible when media platforms acknowledge the depth and range of populist voices involved. Bannon notes that figures like Bill Ackman and David Sacks have been vital in supporting the populist agenda, adding, "We probably have 20 to 30 people.” This coalition includes veterans from diverse political backgrounds, who, according to Bannon, have left behind their progressive roots to rally around a nationalist vision. Why It Matters: This coalition, Bannon believes, has the potential to secure a long-term political realignment, especially with the support of Hispanics and working-class Americans. He sees these alliances as essential to building a majority capable of reshaping the government for decades to come. Bannon’s stance on immigration reform is straightforward and controversial: mass deportations. He argues that tackling undocumented immigration head-on will be a key action plan under a future populist government. "We’re going to have deals with countries, but we must focus,” Bannon says, describing a targeted approach to deportations.

President Donald Trump released a statement on how he will dismantle the deep state; at the same time, the corporate media, like The Atlantic, try to explain their new narrative of what the Deep State is- exactly. Trump’s statement: Donald Trump’s plan to dismantle the Deep State. 1. "Immediately reissue my 2020 executive order, restoring the President's authority to remove rogue bureaucrats.” 2. "Clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus.” 3. "Totally reform… pic.twitter.com/Xhg297uWCe — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) November 8, 2024  In 2017, The Atlantic published an article titled "There Is No American ‘Deep State’.” Written by David A. Graham, it claimed that the concept of a deep state—a shadowy group within government working against elected leaders—was largely a conspiracy theory in the U.S. Graham argued that while bureaucratic resistance to Trump existed, comparing it to Turkey’s deep state, which historically used military coups to preserve secularism, was inaccurate. In Turkey, he explained, the deep state had real power, embedded deeply within the military and intelligence services. But in the U.S., he said, this idea seemed exaggerated, even absurd. The piece’s experts were skeptical, warning that authoritarian leaders could weaponize fear of a "deep state.” They argued that believing in a domestic deep state without evidence could lead to dangerous repression of dissent. The tone of the article was dismissive, casting the idea as largely speculative—a term that some might use to justify political frustrations rather than explain real threats. By 2024, The Atlantic’s tone had shifted significantly. An updated article suggested that entrenched bureaucratic forces in the federal government, especially in public health, do in fact resist political agendas and executive control. The discussion now acknowledged the reality of a quasi-independent "deep state” that works as a check on policies that these career officials view as damaging. This time, the article focused on the potential re-election of Trump and how civil servants might resist his plans to overhaul public health policies if he brought in figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who advocate for fewer regulations in agencies like the FDA. Instead of mocking the concept of a deep state, the 2024 article leaned into the idea, portraying these officials as stewards of scientific integrity and public safety. It emphasized their role in resisting untested or risky policies, framing them as a positive force. The Atlantic now implied that the deep state’s "resistance” to political leaders isn’t insidious but instead a stabilizing force—a check on erratic changes that might harm the public. This shift reflects a new narrative where the deep state isn’t a rogue element but a safety net. The evolution of The Atlantic’s stance on the deep state reflects how narratives can shift over time, often aligning with broader media agendas. In 2017, the publication downplayed any concept of an internal resistance to elected authority. But by 2024, it presented bureaucratic resistance as a necessary safeguard against what it now framed as potentially harmful political interference. But what about the American people? The WarRoom audience readers might question this shift. The same bureaucratic resistance once brushed off as fantasy is now championed as a form of institutional “integrity”. The 2024 narrative shift may suggest a desire to protect certain policies or figures within the public health sphere from external changes demanded by an America First agenda, aligning with concerns voiced by figures in the current administration. The media’s role often extends beyond mere reporting to shaping how ideas are perceived. The Atlantic’s leftward shift from dismissing to defending the "deep state” shows how narratives can adapt based on who holds political power and what goals might be served. In 2017, the deep state idea was seen as an unlikely conspiracy. In 2024, it’s painted as a benevolent force, working to protect the public from potentially hazardous shifts. This narrative shift illustrates a broader trend: as political priorities evolve, so too can the framing of complex issues, often appearing to align with a media outlet’s evolving stance. This shift raises questions about the media’s influence on public opinion. When a major publication alters its view from dismissal to endorsement, it shapes public understanding and trust. It underscores the idea that narratives in the media aren’t fixed—they’re malleable, adapting to shifting political winds. When media messaging seems to serve specific agendas, readers may feel compelled to dig deeper, recognizing that a secret hand shapes how we understand complex political dynamics.

Warroom News

Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec appeared on Saturday’s WarRoom and rallied behind President Trump’s bold strategy to overhaul Washington, celebrating what Bannon calls the “Days of Thunder” era. The phrase, referencing the lightning-fast intensity of Trump’s early days in office, signals a renewed push to disrupt the political system with speed, force, and surprise.
"This isn’t just a presidency; it’s a movement,” Bannon said, framing the strategy as not merely about Trump’s return to power, but a full-scale assault on the establishment. "We’re going after the system—its institutions, its funding, its power—every single day.”
For Bannon, the term “Days of Thunder” represents the high-octane approach Trump used during his first term to challenge the political establishment. It’s not about following the typical rules of politics but about creating new ones, Bannon explained.
The movement is focused on relentless disruption, as Bannon noted, pushing against the powers that be with an urgency that’s often been missing in Washington. "The objective is to disrupt, to create chaos within their system,” Bannon said. "We want them off balance, unable to react.”
Posobiec editor of Human Events and frequent WarRoom guest, a key figure in Trump’s media network and a vocal proponent of nationalist conservatism, added that the key to this strategy is speed. "They’re stuck in old ways of thinking, and they can’t keep up with this new strategy,” Posobiec explained. "It’s not about slow, drawn-out fights—it’s about hitting them with precision and speed, keeping them on their heels.”
The strategy, according to Bannon, involves using the establishment’s own resources against it. For example, he pointed to Trump’s actions to cut funding to institutions like USAID, a frequent target for Trump’s team due to its perceived alignment with liberal causes abroad. "This is maneuver warfare,” Bannon said. "We’re not playing by their rules. We’re finding their weaknesses and exploiting them before they even know what’s happening.”
Trump’s allies are also focusing on dismantling the military-industrial complex, criticizing billions of dollars in taxpayer spending on inefficient defense projects like the F-35 fighter jet. For Bannon and Posobiec, this is part of the broader fight against a system that rewards failure. "This is the kind of system we’re fighting against,” Bannon said. "A system that rewards failure and protects the status quo. We need to break it down from the inside.”
Bannon and Posobiec have also voiced frustration with the Republican establishment, particularly figures like former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. They accuse establishment Republicans of being complicit in the failures of Washington and call them out for not standing up to the political elites. “The Republican establishment is part of the problem,” Bannon said. “They’re too weak to take on the system. We need real change.”
For Bannon and Posobiec, Trump’s return to the White House is more than just another presidential election—it’s the spark for a larger revolution. "This isn’t just about winning an election,” Posobiec concluded. "This is about taking over the system—making it work for America, not the elites.”
As Bannon and Posobiec continue pushing forward with their rapid-fire, high-intensity strategy, they are determined to reshape Washington. "The ‘Days of Thunder’ are just beginning,” Bannon said. "We’re not stopping until the system is ours.”

In the ongoing saga for the WarRoom over the concept of American democracy, one principle stands firm through the years of guests and media: the unyielding pursuit of truth and the right of the American people to speak it. However, reactions to the WarRoom reveal that this pursuit faces significant obstacles from the left/uni party and media talking heads who prefer hiding in the shadows over embracing transparency, disguising censorship as corporate interest, and fearing exposing governmental and corporate malpractice. There is no more recent example of how the WarRoom upholds democrat ideals of Free Speech than a WarRoom segment with Ken Klippenstein, who has risen to notoriety for exposing corruption in the government. “Rare interview of Independent Journalist Ken Klippenstein joining Natalie Winters on WarRoom to discuss the IRS updating documents to add threats to the "ability to govern” as a standard to launch investigations and other inquiries on American citizens,” Vish Bura wrote in reaction to the scandal that was unfolding over Klippestein’s WarRoom appearance,” Vish Burra posted along with a clip from the WarRoom. Ironically, Klippenstein’s recent writing about his departure from The Intercept spoke volumes about the state of journalism today. In his scathing critique from April 2024, he highlighted a shift from fearless, adversarial journalism toward appeasing financial backers. What is happening now is precisely what he was referring to. Klippenstein’s decision to move his pursuit for the truth to Substack showed his desire to be untethered from the corporate influence he felt elsewhere and devoted to uncovering truths that powerful interests would rather remain hidden from the American people. Klippenstein’s recent appearance on the WarRoom program ignited a minor controversy, particularly among those entrenched in the mainstream media echo chamber. His investigation into IRS documents, revealing a disturbing trend of governmental overreach under the guise of national security, struck a nerve. “This revelation that the IRS now targets individuals who purportedly threaten the government’s ‘ability to govern’ reeks of authoritarianism camouflaged as protectionism,” he said. Critics from the corporate media swiftly condemned Klippenstein’s platform choice, attempting to shame him for daring to step outside the approved corporate media choices—as if any of them would be critical of the administrative state, which includes the uni-party-dominated IRS. Aaron Rupar’s dismissal of free speech and others’ derision only expose the establishment’s discomfort when confronted with uncomfortable truths. “I would simply say no to doing friendly interviews on Lindell TV/Steve Bannon’s show. But to each their own,” Aaron Rupar chimed in to shame Klippenstein to his large audience. Yet, as history reminds us, democracy thrives on precisely these uncomfortable truths—the challenging of assumptions, the questioning of authority, and the relentless pursuit of justice. So, who are the champions of democracy? The WarRoom is the obvious answer. As usual, the WarRoom emerges as a platform and a beacon of free speech in an increasingly murky media landscape. Despite Steve Bannon’s current confinement, his vision and mission endure through his team’s unwavering commitment to defending constitutional rights. Hosts like Winters continue to amplify voices like Klippenstein’s, who dare to shine a light into the dark corners of governmental power. In response to the outcry over Klippenstein’s revelations, Darren Beattie, editor of Revolver News and a frequent contributor of the WarRoom rightly noted that the WarRoom “grows stronger”. This strength lies not in conformity but in courage—the courage to challenge, investigate, and report without fear or favor. It is a reminder that true journalism is not about soothing the powerful but about speaking truth to power, even when it unsettles the comfortable. As Grace Anne, an audience member, poignantly questioned, who defines what constitutes a threat to the government? Should it be the government itself, unchecked and unchallenged? The answer lies in the vigilance of an informed populace and the commitment of journalists like Klippenstein to dig deep, unearth facts, and present them without compromise. “Americans would wonder who defines what the government is, to make law through it’s own agency? Without the American people or Congress. Are they ‘instructed’ to sanction enemies or rule upon themselves?” she asked. These are questions the American people are allowed to ask, right? The controversy surroundingKlippenstein’s investigative work on the WarRoom is a stark reminder of the essential role of a free press in a healthy democracy. It is a call to arms for all citizens to demand transparency, accountability, and the preservation of free speech. Democracy is not a spectator sport; it requires active participation, critical thinking, and an unwavering commitment to truth. Let us embrace this challenge, not with fear, but with determination—to ensure that the voices of dissent are heard, the truths are revealed, and the ideals of democracy endure. Support democracy and hear more of the truth: Watch the WarRoom Monday through Saturday from 10 am to noon EST, M-F 5 pm to 6 pm EST on Real America’s Voice, and M-F 6 pm to 7 pm on Frank Speech.

Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters break down the interconnectivity between the administrative state’s targeting of President Trump and the anti-CCP movement. The indictment of Biden whistleblower Gal Luft over his alleged involvement with CEFC China energy and Patrick Ho is the foundational element of judicial weaponization, Bannon explains. Natalie Winters broke news regarding numerous Biden officials and family members involvement with the same CCP entity. She notes that if CEFC is the standard for criminal indictment the Biden regime will loose virtually its entire workforce to indictments. Bannon stresses the importance of focus on the legal cases of Luft, Miles Guo, and President in tackling the judicial weaponization.

Dr. Ralph Baric – a researcher known for his controversial coronavirus collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and advocacy for Gain of Function research – is "reconstructing” viruses with risky tactics potentially responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic in taxpayer-funded studies, War Room can reveal. Conveniently, researchers from Dr. Baric’s team have also started working for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers such as Moderna since the research conducted under the taxpayer-backed grant has been published. Gain of Function (GOF) research refers to the artificial manipulation of viruses to make them deadlier to humans, and Dr. Baric’s frequent use of the risky method is concerning given his deep ties to Chinese Communist Party scientists. Dr. Baric has been described by the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s top bat coronavirus researcher, whom experts allege played a critical role in the lab birthing COVID-19, Shi Zhengli as a "longtime collaborator.” Senator Rand Paul also confronted Anthony Fauci with Dr. Baric’s work during a heated exchange about whether or not his agency, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), had funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology. "For years, Dr. Ralph Baric, a virologist in the U.S., has been collaborating with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute, sharing his discoveries about how to create super viruses. This gain-of-function research has been funded by the NIH.” Despite this controversy, the NIAID is continuing to fund Dr. Baric’s research, most recently for the study, "Host range, transmissibility and antigenicity of a pangolin coronavirus.” The text and methodology of the study, published September 25th, is strikingly similar to Dr. Baric’s manipulations of bat coronaviruses. In the latest paper, researchers used humanized mice models and "reconstructed” viruses from the wild to test their lethality in humans, focusing on the comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and a new pangolin CoV GD strain. "The pathogenic and cross-species transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2- related coronaviruses (CoVs) remain poorly characterized. Here we recovered a wild-type pangolin (Pg) CoV GD strain including derivatives encoding reporter genes using reverse genetics,” explains a summary before emphasizing an "emergence potential”: "Efficient PgCoV replication in primary human cells and hACE2 mice, coupled with a capacity for airborne spread, highlights an emergence potential.” Researchers also used humanized mice models – the same tactic used during controversial bat coronavirus research many believe led to COVID-19. "To test a model more relevant to human populations, we evaluated PgCoV GD growth in the K18 human ACE2 mouse model, which has been repeatedly shown to progress to severe clinical disease and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection,” explains the paper. In some cases, mice experienced a mortality rate of 60 percent. It is unclear whether or not Gain of Function tactics were used by Baric and his researchers, however in a biosafety segment of the paper, his team admitted that they "synthetically reconstructed” a Pangolin Coronavirus that necessitated working in a biosafety level three facility. "Synthetic reconstruction of the authentic, wild-type Pangolin Coronavirus GD virus strain was based on its published sequence and undertaken with the approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Application no. 80022). All constructs were handled under proper biosafety level conditions as specified by the institutional approval, with reconstructed virus handled exclusively at biosafety level 3, with personnel wearing full-body personal protective equipment and HEPA-filtered respiratory protection,” the paper revealed. "Current US Gain-of-Function (GOF) regulations note that wild-type pathogens that are circulating in or have been recovered from nature are not enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs), regardless of their pandemic potential,” adds a disclaimer. Featuring over a dozen researchers besides Baric, one of the paper authors – Yixuan J. Hou – joined the staff of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Moderna shortly after its publication. The unearthed paper follows a separate admission from Dr. Baric that Fauci’s NIAID backed a study focusing on viruses "program[ing] entry into human cells” conducted alongside the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Dr. Baric has also attended Beijing-based scientific conferences discussing "gain-of-function” research alongside several researchers working for the Chinese military and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He spoke at a Chinese Academy of Sciences event in 2015 discussing Gain of Function research alongside researchers working for China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

Dr. Ralph Baric – a researcher known for his controversial coronavirus collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and advocacy for Gain of Function research – received a six-figure grant from Pfizer and routinely failed to disclose the financial conflict of interest with the COVID-19 vaccine maker in dozens of studies, War Room can reveal. Many of the studies published by Dr. Baric focused on COVID-19 response, natural immunity, and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines – including Pfizer’s own products. Baric – who’s attended conferences at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and is described by the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s "bat woman” Shi Zhengli as one of her "longtime collaborators” – has also described lifting bans on gain-of-function research as "critical” and provided the Wuhan lab with humanized mice to likely conduct the controversial form of research with SARS-like coronaviruses. The unearthed financial ties follow Dr. Baric advising conference attendees in 2018 on how to “make money” during pandemics. During his 2018 speech "Imagining the Next Flu Pandemic – and Preventing it!” he presents a slide titled "Global Catastrophe: Opportunities Exist.” The slide outlines what type of stocks and industries surged during the Ebola outbreak, which he uses to extrapolate financial advice on how to "make money in the next pandemic.” "I wanted to give you good news. There are winners out there, right? So if you ever want to be prepared and make money in the next pandemic, if that’s what you want to do, buy stock in Hazmat suit makers and protective clothing or companies that make antiviral drugs for that particular pandemic,” he notes. While speaking over the following slide – "Pandemics: Opportunity” – Baric posits that "pandemics really are times of opportunity.” "There is an opportunity for people to have political gain, financial gain, and personal gain during times of social upheaval, and that will probably occur,” he adds. Baric appears to have heeded his own advice, receiving a six-figure grant from Pfizer in June 2020, stealthily revealed on a progress report for his project, the Rapidly Emerging Antiviral Drug Discovery Initiative. From June to July 2020, he took in $323,614 from the COVID-19 vaccine maker “to evaluate the potency of a panel of drugs against SARS-CoV2 replication in vitro and in vivo.” That equates to nearly $11,000 per day. Dr. Baric “is a member of the advisory board of VaxArt and Inviyd, and has collaborations with Takeda, Pfizer, Moderna, Ridgeback Biosciences, Gilead, and Eli Lily,” revealed the paper in the conflicts of interest section. This paper, however, is an anomaly as dozens of papers published under Dr. Baric since he received cash from Pfizer contain no mention of his work with the pharmaceutical giant. Many of these papers directly address COVID-19 vaccines and their efficacy such as:

Dr. Ralph Baric – a researcher known for his controversial coronavirus collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and advocacy for Gain of Function research – received a six-figure grant from Pfizer and routinely failed to disclose the financial conflict of interest with the COVID-19 vaccine maker in dozens of studies, War Room can reveal. Many of the studies published by Dr. Baric focused on COVID-19 response, natural immunity, and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines – including Pfizer’s own products. Baric – who’s attended conferences at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and is described by the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s "bat woman” Shi Zhengli as one of her "longtime collaborators” – has also described lifting bans on gain-of-function research as "critical” and provided the Wuhan lab with humanized mice to likely conduct the controversial form of research with SARS-like coronaviruses.
