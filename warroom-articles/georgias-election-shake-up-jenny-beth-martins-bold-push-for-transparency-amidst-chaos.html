<p>Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, provided a detailed update on electoral reforms to the WarRoom on Saturday about Georgia. Martin’s insights addressed the critical need for transparency and accuracy in future elections there.</p>
<p>Martin began by celebrating recent victories in Georgia’s election reforms from the past week.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The Georgia State Election Board has passed some significant rules,” she noted, emphasizing the new requirement for voters to show ID when returning absentee ballots in person. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Martin also praised the clarification on certification procedures, which she believes is essential to ensure that votes are accurately counted before certification, thus avoiding post-certification disputes that plagued previous elections.</p>
<p>A major focus of Martin’s commentary was reopening an investigation into alleged voting irregularities in Fulton County from the 2020 election.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The investigation into duplicate and missing ballots has been revived,” she said. Martin expressed frustration that the investigation had not been fully covered or resolved previously, stressing the importance of learning from past mistakes.</strong></p>
<p><strong> “We have to ensure that we understand what went wrong to prevent a repeat of those issues in future elections,” she added.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>One of Martin’s key points was her support for a new rule that mandates counting ballots at the precinct level before they leave. This rule, set to be finalized by August 19th, would ensure that the number of paper ballots matches the number of ballots scanned and reconciles with the number of voters who checked in that day. “This is a simple yet crucial step to ensure the accuracy of our vote counts,” Martin said.</p>
<p>She believes that this measure will help address discrepancies and build confidence in the electoral process.</p>
<p>Martin acknowledged calls for paper ballots’ importance and pointed out the practical constraints. “While paper ballots are crucial, implementing such a change on a large scale right before an election may be challenging,” she noted.</p>
<p>Martin argued that significant changes to the voting process would require action from the state legislature rather than administrative orders alone. She praised Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s executive order for paper ballots but recognized that similar measures in Georgia would need legislative support to be effective.</p>
<p>She concluded her WarRoom discussion with a call to action for vigilance and preparation.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> “We need to ensure our processes are as secure as possible given where we are with the upcoming election,” she emphasized. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Her remarks reflect a broader concern about electoral integrity and the need for continuous improvement in the voting system.</p>
<p>Martin’s comments shed light on the ongoing efforts to reform Georgia’s election process, focusing on transparency, accuracy, and the need for legislative action to support meaningful changes.</p>
<p>Her advocacy for practical measures and thorough investigations underscores a commitment to ensuring that future elections are conducted with the utmost integrity.</p>
