<p>The WarRoom hosts and guests will be at the Republican Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, next week and Saturday’s WarRoom was a bit of a teaser about what to expect there. Raheem Kassam, co-host of the Saturday program and editor of The National Pulse, talked to the Editor of Human Events, both long-time contributors to the WarRoom, about recent discussions with<a href="https://warroom.org/outside-of-jail-steve-bannon-said-he-expects-fair-treatment-from-bureau-of-prisons-amid-unhinged-left/"> political prisoner</a> Steve Bannon about what to expect from the week-long event.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“War Room is committed to showing you the realities the mainstream media won’t. We bring you the unfiltered truth, highlighting what others ignore or downplay,” Kassam said on Saturday morning’s program. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In their discussion,  Kassam and Posobiec emphasized the critical upcoming events in American politics, particularly contrasting the Republican National Convention (RNC) with their grim predictions for the Democratic Convention in Chicago. War Room’s commitment to providing alternative coverage that mainstream media often overlooks or downplays is central to their discussion.</p>
<p>Kassam, who had just <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/analysis-post/what-is-the-rnc-convention-and-how-does-it-work/?feed_id=13131&amp;_unique_id=669296d3798e9">published an article</a> at National Pulse on what to expect at the convention, started the segment by sharply criticizing Joe Biden’s administration, labeling it a series of mistakes and stressing the need for a flawless RNC. Posobiec joined him and predicted scenes of chaos, carnage, and corruption at the Democratic Convention, drawing parallels to the tumultuous 1968 event in Chicago, which he anticipates will be exacerbated but not adequately covered by traditional media outlets.</p>
<p>Posobiec echoes Kassam’s sentiments about the importance of Bannon’s WarRoom coverage, highlighting War Room’s role in showcasing past unrest, such as the violence and protests during the 2016 DNC that were allegedly underreported everywhere else.</p>
<p>BANNON’S HOUSE STYLE</p>
<p>In fact, the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2l-M1n_seo">Trump@War</a>, made by Steve Bannon in 2018, was based on that exact violence and is likely the source of the idea of the WarRoom “Force Multipliers” and “flotilla of ships” (watch to the end).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2018 Stephen K. Bannon Movie- Trump@War is an excellent primer about what to expect for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RNC2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RNC2024</a> with footage from Trump 2016</p>
<p>Watch: <a href="https://t.co/A4RK1e7054">https://t.co/A4RK1e7054</a></p>
<p>— Kari Baxter Donovan (@Saorsa1776) <a href="https://twitter.com/Saorsa1776/status/1812164320597287404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the segment, Kassam returned to the importance of the RNC presenting itself as competent and pragmatic, focusing on solutions rather than ideological purity. They both argue that this is crucial for appealing to independents and centrists disillusioned by what they perceive as systemic election irregularities.</p>
<p>Kassam issues a stark call to action, urging viewers to actively participate in the electoral process despite any perceived inevitability, citing concerns about election integrity and manipulation through tactics like mail-in ballots and ballot harvesting.</p>
<p>Their discussion combines strategic political analysis with media critique, emphasizing the need for transparency and vigilance in the face of what they characterize as widespread corruption.</p>
<p>Through War Room, Kassam and Posobiec aim to provide viewers with an alternative perspective, positioning themselves as champions of unfiltered truth amidst what they perceive as biased mainstream media narratives. This narrative seeks to mobilize their audience politically and underscores their commitment to highlighting what they believe are overlooked or deliberately suppressed aspects of American political reality.</p>
