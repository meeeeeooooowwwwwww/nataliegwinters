<p>Jack Posobiec appeared on the WarRoom on Thursday and talked to host Dave Brat about the current U.S. foreign policy. He said that the Biden administration has left the nation overstretched and vulnerable, with rising global tensions and military exhaustion. Posobiec said President Donald J Trump’s return to the White House is essential to restoring American strength, avoiding unnecessary conflicts, and focusing on critical security threats, particularly from China.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Four years ago we were not at war,” Posobiec remarked, pointing to how quickly the global situation has deteriorated under the Biden administration. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Posobiec highlighted that under Trump’s previous administration, the U.S. was not engaged in multiple conflicts, contrasting with the current situation involving “14 hotspots around the globe” that drain military resources and weaken national security. He criticizes the Biden administration for exacerbating military recruitment and cultural issues through “woke and weaponized” ideologies.</p>
<p>Posobiec added that he believes Trump’s foreign policy—emphasizing military strength as a deterrent and pragmatic diplomacy—is the solution to the current challenges. He cites Trump’s success with the Abraham Accords and direct negotiations with North Korea as evidence of his effective use of economic and diplomatic power to maintain stability without excessive military engagement.</p>
<p>Posobiec told the WarRoom that he believes that Trump’s approach to foreign policy, which centers on military strength and diplomatic pragmatism, is the most effective way to navigate these challenges. "If you have a strong military… then you don’t need to go to war,” he said, emphasizing that Trump’s philosophy is not about projecting military power through endless conflicts but using strength as a deterrent. Posobiec suggested this strategy would avoid the need for “boots on the ground all over the world” while maintaining U.S. influence and security.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of Trump’s foreign policy approach, according to Posobiec, is his ability to negotiate and broker deals that lead to peace and stability. “What does Trump always push for? It’s business deals. How can we do business with these places?” Posobiec asked, referring to Trump’s success with the Abraham Accords in the Middle East and his direct negotiations with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. Posobiec argued that these accomplishments demonstrated that Trump knew how to leverage economic and diplomatic power to create long-term stability without unnecessary military interventions.</p>
<p>Posobiec told Brat that he contends that the Biden administration is failing to effectively address the Chinese Communist threat. He criticizes its reliance on “Wall Street and globalists” that have allowed China to dominate trade and manufacturing. He stresses Trump’s use of tariffs and trade policies to confront China’s economic practices.</p>
<p>Posobiec suggests that Trump’s leadership is needed to pivot U.S. focus back to crucial threats like China and to bring stability through his proven track record of strength in diplomacy and economic leverage. He contrasts this with the current administration’s disorganized strategy and suggests Trump’s return is vital for ensuring national security and avoiding further entanglement in global conflicts.</p>
