<p>George Soros and a slew of anti-Trump activists are backing an effort to recruit poll workers for the 2024 election in collaboration with state election offices.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Power The Polls appears to be gearing up for the 2024 election, recently announcing a new Advisory council to roll out a vast army of poll watchers ahead of November. The group boasts of recruiting over 700,000 poll workers for the 2020 election and is currently working with state election offices including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ahead of the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Politico noted that Power the Polls was "<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2023/04/18/soros-foundations-top-man-moves-on-00092571">stood</a> up” by the Open Society Foundation, the hub of Soros’ political activism and far-left giving. A deeper investigation reveals the group is part of Work Elections, which is a project of the Fair Election Network. In turn, the Fair Election <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/fair-elections-center-fair-elections-legal-network/">Network</a> is backed by the New Venture Fund, the leading billion-dollar dark money group supports President Joe Biden and <a href="https://medium.com/@RobletoFire/soros-foundations-put-24m-into-pro-biden-dark-money-network-in-2019-a608b0b19960">counts</a> Soros among its donors.</p>
<p>Similarly, individuals from far-left activist organizations that have received funds from <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/358913-desmond-meades-new-pac-pours-1-5-million-into-orlandos-state-attorney-race/">Soros</a>-linked groups including the Open Society Foundation and New Venture Fund such as the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/illuminative/#:~:text=IllumiNative%2520is%2520a%2520left%252Dof,liberal%2520%E2%80%9Cdark%2520money%E2%80%9D%2520organizations.">llumiNative</a>, and <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/organization/civic-responsibility-project/">the</a> Civic Rights Responsibility Project are on the advisory council.</p>
<p><span>While Power The Polls, which describes itself as the "nonpartisan leader in poll worker recruitment” claimed the new 14-member group was a "bipartisan” effort, its lack of any pro-Trump activists suggest otherwise. Furthermore, t</span>he council is co-chaired by actress Kerry Washington and infamous critic of President Trump Rep. Adam Kinzinger.</p>
<p>"At a time when our democracy is facing unique and historic threats, the role poll workers play in keeping our elections free and fair has never been more important,” said the former Illinois Congressman. "That’s why Power the Polls’ work is so important and why I’m proud to serve as the Advisory Council’s Co-Chair. I encourage all Americans to sign up to be poll workers through Power the Polls as a great way to serve our communities.”</p>
<p>Even more concerning, however, is the participation of current election officials including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling. It remains unclear the scope of Power the Polls’s influence over these offices. Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, for example, is also involved, alluding to collaboration between his office and Power the Polls: "By <a href="https://www.powerthepolls.org/council-member/Francisco%20Aguilar">connecting</a> election officials with potential poll workers, Power the Polls helps jurisdictions across the country serve voters and ensure safe and fair elections.”</p>
