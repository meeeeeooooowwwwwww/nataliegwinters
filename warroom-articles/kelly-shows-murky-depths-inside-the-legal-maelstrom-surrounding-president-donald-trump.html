<div>
<p>Recent developments in the ever-churning cesspool of legal battles surrounding  President Donald J. Trump have again thrust the nasty details of the judicial process into the spotlight. During the flurry of motions, filings, and social media commentary regarding the Florida classified documents case against Trump, two things are abundantly clear: 1) the proceedings are anything but straightforward, and 2)Julie Kelly is still the pathfinder and on the job.</p>
<p>Jack Smith on Friday asked <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/aileen-cannon-donald-trump-attorney-1899618">federal judge Aileen Cannon</a> for a gag order, insisting that Trump’s “reckless comments” in a fundraising email not only could spur violence against the FBI, but also violated Trump’s terms of release after his indictment.</p>
<p>An ‘X” poster, Ron Coleman’s poignant assessment, sparked by a Julie Kelly tweet, encapsulates the sentiments of many observers.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Jack Smith and the organization that employs him hold liberty in black-hearted contempt,” Coleman declared, echoing the frustration and skepticism surrounding the handling of Trump’s pre-trial matters.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Trump and his lawyers are pushing back on the attempt to put a gag on the Presidential candiate, according to Kelly.</p>
<p>In response to a filing from the DOJ asking the Florida court to gag Trump, his legal team responded, as <a href="https://x.com/julie_kelly2/status/1795257371029061674">posted</a> by Kelly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“President Donald J. Trump’s motion to strike and request for sanctions based on the special counsel’s May 24 2024 motion President Donald J. Trump respectfully submits this procedural opposition to the Mets 24th, 2024 filing of the special counsel’s office, which improperly asked the court to impose an unconstitutional gag or on President Trump as a condition of his pre-trial release based on vague and unsupported ascertain about threats to law enforcement Personnel whose names have been redacted from public filing and whose identities are already subject to a protective order.</p>
<p>For the reasons set forth below in light of the office’s blatant violation of local rule 88.9 in related warnings from the court. The court should strike the motion and make civil contempt findings as to all government attorneys who participated in the decision to file the motion without meaningful conferral and impose sanctions after holding an evidentiary hearing regarding the purpose and intent behind the office’s decision to willfully disregard required procedures.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/julie_kelly2/status/1795242849681756487">Adding more commentary:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“I can tell you as someone who has covered these proceedings diligently including attending court hearings, Cannon will not take lightly Smith’s failure to confer with defense in any meaningful way before posting the motion. Trump motion on left, Smith’s footnote on right”<a href="https://x.com/julie_kelly2/status/1795242849681756487/photo/2">: (See Tweet for footnote.)</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Kelly’s revelations on Monday shed light on the convoluted nature of Biden’s Department of Justice’s legal maneuvering. In response to President Trump’s motion challenging the imposition of an “unconstitutional gag,” the Special Counsel’s office finds itself embroiled in a heated debate over procedural irregularities and alleged disregard for established protocols.</p>
<p>As Kelly highlights in the court’s documentation, Trump’s legal team accuses government attorneys of flouting rules and engaging in what appears to be a calculated attempt to stifle Trump’s voice.</p>
<p>The portrayal of key figures, such as Jack Smith, Jay Brat, and David Harbach, as orchestrators of a political vendetta rather than champions of justice is being exposed in an already complex narrative.</p>
<p>Kelly’s scathing assessment of the government legal team leaves no room for questions, painting a picture of a legal system mired in controversy and allegations of impropriety.</p>
<p>Accusations of collusion, misconduct, and ulterior motives cast a shadow over the impartiality of the legal proceedings facing Trump- a presidential candidate, raising fundamental questions about the sanctity of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Here is what Kelly reported to her social media:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<span>It is now crystal clear that Jack Smith, Jay Brat, and David Harbach (former Comey counsel and Smith’s wingman at Obama’s DOJ public integrity unit) have no interest in maintaining a scintilla of integrity/decorum in this imploding case.</span></p>
<p>All the antics, all the government motions are only about PR spin to make it look like Judge Cannon is the villain here. And she knows a lot more that she cannot say bc much of the proceedings are sealed under CIPA rules. Brat’s conduct is the subject of a Congressional inquiry, a DOJ OPR probe (haha) and in Judge Cannon’s courtroom.</p>
<p>A dirty case from start to finish–which is why Cannon appointed a special master in Sept 2022 to prevent the sort of corruption now playing out. Misplaced evidence including “classified” files; an unprecedented armed, dangerous, incognito raid of MAL; false representations to the court; and proof of collusion with Biden’s White House long before an official investigation began–just to name a few scandals.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks Smith hopes Cannon will dismiss the case so he can avoid her relentless pursuit of the truth and bringing this bogus case to trial in a jurisdiction far less hostile to Trump than DC or NYC. Next month will be even more brutal for the special counsel in Florida as he will be forced to defend what some (Ed Meese) consider his unlawful appointment and evidence of collusion between Biden general counsel, NARA, DOJ and FBI to concoct a documents crime against Donald Trump during a series of hearings.</p>
<p>All this in addition to SCOTUS’ likely reversal of 1512c2 in Jan 6 cases, which could impact Smith’s J6 indictment against Trump in Washington, and remanding immunity question back to DC federal court for more clarification, June could be a nightmare for Jack Smith and the DOJ. Good.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond Trump’s fate, many Americans see that the judicial system’s integrity hangs in the balance. Opponents of Trump’s and the America First agenda have tarnished the judicial system’s reputation as a whole.</p>
<p>As the legal drama unfolds, with hearings and inquiries looming on the horizon, the coming months promise to be a crucible for all involved. The specter of congressional inquiries, departmental probes, and judicial scrutiny looms large, casting a pall over the already contentious proceedings.</p>
