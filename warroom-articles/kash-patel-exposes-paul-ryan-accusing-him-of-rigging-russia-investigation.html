<p>In a recent discussion on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom program, Kash Patel, a former chief investigator for the House Intelligence Committee, shared more details about former House Speaker Paul Ryan’s role in the handling of the Steele Dossier during the initial stages of the Russia investigation.</p>
<p>According to Patel, Ryan had access to the Steele Dossier much earlier than others and deliberately kept it secret from investigators, including Patel, who reported directly to him.  We<a href="https://warroom.org/the-secret-hand-of-paul-ryan-unveiling-his-hidden-role-in-the-steele-dossier-scandal/"> reported</a> when the details of this story first broke.</p>
<p>Now Patel adds more details about the saga of betrayal.</p>
<p>Patel began by highlighting the hypocrisy of Paul Ryan, who had recently publicly distanced himself from Donald Trump in the corporate media, citing “character concerns.” Patel challenged Ryan’s integrity by exposing the details of the House Russia investigation, which was heavily influenced by the controversial Steele Dossier. This dossier, filled with unverified claims about Trump, was a key element in the early investigations into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>
<p>In early 2017, after BuzzFeed published the Steele Dossier, Ryan instructed the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the document and the broader Russia collusion claims. Patel talked to Bannon about his service, as the chief investigator, was tasked with uncovering the truth behind the dossier, including who commissioned it, its origins, and its dissemination to the FBI. Throughout the investigation, Patel said that he and his team interviewed 70 witnesses under oath, aiming to piece together the truth about the dossier and its role in the Russia investigation.</p>
<p>The crucial revelation Patel shared on Bannon’s show was that Paul Ryan and his Chief of Staff, Jonathan Burks, had access to the Steele Dossier from the end of 2016 or early 2017. Despite this, Ryan did not disclose this information to Patel or other investigators. This omission was significant because, had Patel known about Ryan’s prior access to the dossier, it would have fundamentally altered the course of the investigation. Patel emphasized that knowing Ryan had the dossier would have led to questions about how Ryan obtained it, the motivations behind his secrecy, and whether there were any financial or political incentives involved.</p>
<p>Patel accused Ryan of effectively rigging the investigation from the start. He pointed out that Ryan’s Chief of Staff went on record during subsequent litigation, stating they had not received the dossier directly from Christopher Steele. However, this deflection did not absolve them from the responsibility of informing the investigating committee, which was working tirelessly to uncover the truth about the dossier and its implications.</p>
<p>Bannon and Patel also discussed how Ryan’s actions had broader consequences for the investigation and political dynamics in Washington. Patel recounted how Devin Nunes, then Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was forced to recuse himself from the investigation, handing over control to Adam Schiff. This shift further complicated the investigation, as Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both known critics of Trump, took the lead, while the Republicans on the committee were sidelined.</p>
<p>Patel called for accountability, stating that Paul Ryan and his associates should be put under oath to explain their actions. He criticized the media’s portrayal of Ryan as a figure of integrity, arguing that Ryan’s conduct during the Russia investigation revealed a profound lack of ethical leadership.</p>
<p>The conversation on “WarRoom” underscored the deep-seated frustrations within the Trump camp regarding the handling of the Russia investigation and the Steele Dossier. Patel’s allegations against Ryan highlight the complexities and perceived injustices of the investigation, suggesting that political biases significantly influenced the process and outcomes.</p>
