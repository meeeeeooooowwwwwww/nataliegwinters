<p>Raynard Jackson, President of Black Americans for a Better Future, strongly criticizes DEI policies and the proponents of DEI, characterizing it as a radical agenda purportedly promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion but, in his view, actually serving to hold the Black community back.</p>
<p>Jackson is targeting White liberals with his recent pointed comments, especially female White Liberals, for denying Black Americans their proper representation.</p>
<p>According to Jackson, figures like Roland Martin, Joy Reid, and Don Lemon, along with organizations such as the NAACP, the National Urban League, and the Congressional Black Caucus, subscribe to this belief, blaming external factors for holding Black Americans back. However, Jackson asserts that the true impediment lies within the community itself.</p>
<p>“Radical liberal Blacks like Roland Martin, Joy Reid, and Don Lemon and their organizations, the NAACP, the National Urban League, and the Congressional Black Caucus, think everyone and everything is holding us back.  In reality, we are the only ones holding us back,” Jackson said, introducing his latest column for The Black Man.</p>
<p>While DEI initiatives aim to foster diversity and inclusivity in various spheres, Jackson vehemently opposes them, aligning himself against the left’s support for such policies.</p>
<p>Jackson has a history of voicing dissent against left-leaning ideologies, including in past instances where he criticized figures like Don Lemon and Joy Reid, accusing them of disseminating harmful narratives within the Black community.</p>
<p>Flashback to 2020:</p>
<p>Now Jackson is taking issue with pushing DEI:</p>
<p>Jackson, in his latest column,  argues that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) has become the new civil rights movement, but it has lost its relevance. While the original civil rights movement targeted specific injustices against Black Americans, DEI, he says, has been expanded to include various groups, including white women and immigrants, diluting its focus away from people who have suffered from the legacy of slavery.</p>
<p>Jackson holds nothing back in directing the appointment of White Women to positions of authority in DEI departments.</p>
<p>Here is what Raynard Jackson reported:</p>
<p>(<strong>ThyBlackMan.com</strong>) Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is the new civil rights!  No, not in the historic sense that the civil rights movement of the nineteen sixties ushered in a wave of new laws that made sure that Blacks were treated equal to whites as the U.S. Constitution had already guaranteed; but rather because, like the civil rights movement of today, it has become so "woke,” unrecognizable and watered down such that it no longer has any relevance.</p>

<p>We cannot even define civil rights in the twenty first century and who should be its beneficiary?</p>
<p>The civil rights movement of the nineteen sixties was specifically meant to apply only to <em><a href="https://thyblackman.com/author/raynard-jackson/">Blacks</a></em> because of our unique history in America, i.e. being brought to the U.S. via slavery.</p>
<p>Remember, in the nineteen sixties we were only one hundred years removed from slavery, reconstruction, and Jim Crow.</p>
<p>Thus, civil rights were targeted to a narrow, specific group, Blacks, whose damages could be specifically identified.  Civil rights was America’s attempt to right the wrongs of slavery and other injustices leveled against Blacks.  It was not meant for white women or "people of color.”</p>
<p>What the hell does people of color even mean?</p>
<p>But, as with most government programs, civil rights morphed into what I call "civil entitlements.”  In the early nineteen seventies, the laws were expanded to include white women, homosexuals, transsexuals’, illegals, Hispanics, Indians, Asians, blah, blah, blah!!!</p>
<p>DEI is a radical offshoot of the civil rights laws of the nineteen sixties that has become the political embodiment of radical liberalism in the extreme.</p>
<p>Why should someone who "legally” immigrated from Nigeria, India, or China qualify for any such laws or programs?</p>
<p>They voluntarily came to the U.S.; they never experienced slavery; they never had water hoses or dogs unleashed on them.</p>
<p>In the military we call this mission creep.  We invade a country for one reason and then end up promoting regime change through military force, i.e. Iraq.</p>
<p>Blacks are the only group that should have been eligible for any of these civil rights and racial preference programs and then only for a designated period of time, not in perpetuity.</p>
<p>DEI has become like pornography.  Most people cannot tell you what it is, but they know it when they see it.</p>
<p>That is problematic, especially for corporate America.</p>
<p>The current incarnation of civil rights and DEI is not sustainable.</p>
<p>These programs started out with Blacks, then expanded to white women, homosexuals, transexuals, Indians, Hispanics, Asians, those with long hair, midgets, bisexuals, gender non-conforming, pan-sexuals, lesbians, handicapped, fat people, those with tattoos, non-binary, and people of color…The list expands every day.</p>
<p>Again, this is unsustainable!</p>
<p>None of these groups should be considered a protected class, legally or politically.</p>
<p>You have those in the country illegally with deportation orders going to court claiming their "civil rights” have been violated.</p>
<p>How in the hell can you be in the U.S. illegally and claim protective status?  Try that in Africa or Mexico, or the Middle East and see how fast you land in jail and deported back to your country of origin.</p>
<p>Corporate America will embrace a private sector version of diversity simply because it is good for business.  Most employers want their workforce to positively reflect the environment that they operate in.</p>
<p>But, the last thing they need or want is to have local, state, or federal mandates forced on them.  History has proven that is a recipe for disaster!</p>
<p>Isn’t it interesting to note that most people who head up DEI initiatives are white women?  The people who understand diversity the least are the ones the powers that be put in charge.</p>
<p>According to the national consulting firm McKinsey, corporate America spends about eight billion dollars annually on DEI.  And most of this money is controlled by non-minorities, i.e. white folks!</p>
<p>So much for diversity.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the many times white folks have told me they know more about the Black community than I do.</p>
<p>Go figure, but I digress.</p>
