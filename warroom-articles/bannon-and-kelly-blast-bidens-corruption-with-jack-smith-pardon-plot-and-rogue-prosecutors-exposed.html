<h5>Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly tore into the Biden administration on Friday’s WarRoom, accusing it of orchestrating legal overreach to protect its own officials while targeting its political opponents. Together, Bannon and Kelly spotlighted key players in the Democrat Biden administration and smashed the legal system, claiming their combined actions threatened American democracy.</h5>
<h3>Bannon Dares Biden to Issue Pardons</h3>
<p>Bannon wasted no time, opening the conversation with a bold challenge to the Biden administration. He dared the regime to issue blanket pardons for those involved in the politically charged investigations against former President Donald Trump. "We dare you. Try it. Do it. We want to bury these criminals. We want to bury the Democratic Party,” he said, referring to individuals involved in what he called a “criminal” network.</p>
<p>Bannon continued along his line of attack, saying that issuing pardons for these figures would only expose the administration’s corruption and fuel the populist backlash. "They’ve terrorized this country. We dare you to give them blanket pardons,” he said.</p>
<h3>Julie Kelly Names Names: Prosecutors and Their Alleged Crimes</h3>
<p>Julie Kelly brought even more heat to the discussion, revealing names of individuals who she claims have been part of this alleged conspiracy to target Trump and his allies. She started by naming Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing the Mar-a-Lago document case. Kelly accused Smith of manipulating the legal process to benefit the Biden administration. "The whole investigation into the so-called classified documents case was conducted in Washington, DC, even though the alleged crime happened in Florida,” Kelly pointed out. She argued that this move was strategic, as Washington judges are more likely to support the case than those in Florida.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Instead of conducting the investigation in the proper jurisdiction, they did it in Washington, DC,” Kelly continued. "They knew they couldn’t get a rubber-stamp approval in Florida.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bannon joined in, criticizing other prosecutors on Smith’s team, including J. Brad, David Harbach, and James Pierce. He asked, "What’s your beef with Jack Smith and J. Brad?” implying these prosecutors were part of a larger political scheme designed to harm Trump. The discussion quickly became focused on what Kelly believes are their real motives: to protect the Biden administration.</p>
<h3>Accusations of Legal and Political Manipulation</h3>
<p>Kelly accused the Biden administration of using the legal system as a political weapon to protect itself from scrutiny. One of her most significant revelations was the involvement of Biden’s legal team in the investigations. "There’s proof that Jack Smith was taking marching orders from the Biden White House,” she revealed. She cited meetings between Biden’s legal counsel and Smith’s team, pointing to a clear chain of communication that allegedly links the president’s office to these high-profile legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Bannon and Kelly also criticized the ongoing January 6th investigations, accusing the administration of keeping the "jack boots” on the ground to arrest people connected to the event. Bannon warned that these actions would continue unless stopped, painting a grim picture of what he described as a regime that won’t back down until it has destroyed its opposition.</p>
<h3>The Rogue’s Gallery: Who Are the Real Criminals?</h3>
<p>The conversation took a darker turn as Kelly and Bannon named more figures involved in this web of alleged corruption. Kelly noted the potential risks of preemptive pardons, likening it to the Hunter Biden pardon, which she sees as a way to shield Joe Biden from legal fallout. "A blanket pardon for Jack Smith and his team would be just like the Hunter Biden pardon,” she warned.</p>
<p>Bannon also highlighted some of the other key figures he believes are behind these legal actions. "You’ve got Fauci and his lies about Wuhan, you’ve got Liz Cheney, and now you’ve got Jack Smith and his team,” he said. These individuals, according to Bannon and Kelly, have played central roles in perpetuating a narrative of political persecution and legal overreach.</p>
<h3>What’s Next: A Call for Justice</h3>
<p>Both Bannon and Kelly concluded the conversation with a call for action. Bannon’s message was clear: the Biden administration must be held accountable for what they see as a corrupt, lawless operation. "They’re not going to stop until you stop it,” Bannon warned, urging the public to stay vigilant.</p>
<p>Kelly echoed Bannon’s sentiments, emphasizing that the only way to expose the corruption was through investigative journalism and legal challenges. "It’s up to us to uncover the truth,” she said, implying that the fight against this alleged injustice was far from over.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: A Battle for Democracy</h3>
<p>The conversation between Bannon and Kelly paints a picture of a political and legal system where power is misused and the truth is buried. By naming the individuals allegedly behind this corruption and highlighting their actions, they hope to spark a wider conversation about accountability and the state of American democracy. As the WarRoom segment concluded, the message was clear: the battle is far from over, and justice will only be served if the American people stand up and demand it.</p>
