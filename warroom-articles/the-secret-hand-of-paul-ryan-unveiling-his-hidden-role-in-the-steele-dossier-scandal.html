<div>
<p>In a revealing conversation on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom Program on Saturday, Kash Patel discussed the hidden involvement of former House Speaker Paul Ryan with the Steele dossier, a document central to the Russia collusion investigation use against President Donald J. Trump. The discussion revolved around Patel’s claims that Ryan had a copy of the Steele dossier as early as 2016 but failed to disclose this critical information during the investigation led by US Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Patel.</p>
<p>Patel began by recalling the scandals of 2016, marked by relentless allegations of Russia collusion against Trump in his campaign and 2016 victory as POTUS.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"It was Russia collusion, Russia collusion, Russia collusion,” Patel recounted. He highlighted that he and Nunes were enlisted by Ryan to investigate these claims. At that time, the Steele dossier was already being used to unlawfully surveil Trump, unbeknownst to them Patel reminded the WarRoom audience.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The bombshell revelation came when Patel shared that Ryan had the creepy Steele dossier from the beginning.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Speaker Paul Ryan, who charged us with investigating Russia, was the first guy to ever get a copy of the Steele dossier in 2016,” Patel told Bannon. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>During the conversation, Patel emphasized that Ryan never admitted to having the dossier, and this fact only emerged later in a British court where Christopher Steele was being sued. Patel reflected on the implications of this concealed knowledge, suggesting that key questions could have been answered early in the investigation. "We could have asked, where did you get it? Who did you get it from? How was it paid for? All of these secrets could have come out,” he lamented.</p>
<p>Patel expressed frustration over Ryan’s actions, particularly how they undermined the investigation. He accused Ryan of rigging the probe from the start. "He rigged it from the beginning,” Patel asserted, further criticizing Ryan’s contemporary political stance and influence. "So I’m done listening to lectures about the new conservative brand that is Paul Ryan. Anytime he wants to debate me, I’m all in.”</p>
<p>The conversation took a significant turn when Bannon pressed Patel on the specifics of Ryan’s possession of the dossier. Bannon asked, "Are you telling me and telling this audience in a British Court filing that Steele filed under penalty of perjury, he identified that Paul Ryan actually had the Steele dossier before he charged you guys and he never informed Devin Nunes, the chairman of that?”</p>
<p>Patel confirmed this assertion unequivocally, stating, "100% accurate. The Steele dossier was handed to Paul Ryan’s chief of staff in 2016.”</p>
<p>Patel criticized Ryan’s team for their inadequate response and secrecy. "They put out a mealy-mouse retreat response, basically saying, ‘Oh, we didn’t get it from Christopher Steele directly,’” he noted, emphasizing that Ryan’s team had the dossier and kept it hidden through 2016, 2017, and 2018. The dossier, a crucial piece of evidence, was part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant Patel obtained from the Department of Justice (DOJ), despite Ryan’s resistance to its declassification. "Now we know why he had it for sure,” Patel added, suggesting that Ryan’s actions were deliberate.</p>
<p>Bannon concluded the conversation with a provocative suggestion: "Maybe we should be interrogating Paul Ryan under oath.” He forewarned Ryan, "Paul Ryan, your time, your turn in the barrel is coming, bro.”</p>
