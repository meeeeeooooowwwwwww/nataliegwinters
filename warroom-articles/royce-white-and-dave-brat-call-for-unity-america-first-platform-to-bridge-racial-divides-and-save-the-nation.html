<p>Royce White, Republican candidate for US Senate, and Dave Brat spoke on Thursday on the WarRoom at length about critical issues of unity, race, and the America First platform. Both highlighted the importance of transcending political and racial divides to save the nation and how the America First movement offers a unique opportunity to redefine American politics by prioritizing unity and challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>Both White and Brat emphasized that unity is essential to overcoming these challenges.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>White stated, “We have to heal the racial divide in order to save the Republic.” He believes that Americans must reject the labels that divide them, such as “European-American” or “African-American,” and instead embrace their shared identity as Americans. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Brat supported this view, arguing that the America First platform offers a path forward that transcends the old Republican-Democrat split, focusing instead on prioritizing the interests of all Americans, regardless of race.</p>
<p>White urged Christians and patriots to take action, saying, “Love is truth, and we have the opportunity right now to save this country.”</p>
<p>Royce White, a former NBA player turned political activist, described the current political landscape as a “pivotal moment” for the country. He argued that the stakes in this election are higher than ever before, noting that “we have a chance to decide whether or not we have a country.” White’s message centered on the idea that America is at a crossroads where the election outcome could determine the nation’s future.</p>
<p>Central to White’s vision is the need to heal the racial divide that has long plagued America. He emphasized that the current political climate, particularly the Democrats’ focus on the LGBTQ+ agenda, has exposed the party’s true intentions. “If they had just kept it about race, they might have been able to keep the wool over black people’s eyes,” White said. However, he believes that the overreach of this agenda has caused many in the black community to see through the Democrats’ facade.</p>
<p>White further argued that Donald Trump represents a unique figure in American politics, particularly for black voters. He pointed out that Trump was once beloved by the black community, and he celebrated and was invited to their gatherings.</p>
<p>He believes that Trump’s willingness to challenge both the Democratic and Republican establishments has opened the door for all Americans to see him as a genuine candidate willing to fight the power, rather than simply toeing the party line.</p>
<p>Brat, a former congressman and economic expert, echoed White’s sentiments, focusing on the failures of Democrat-controlled cities and education systems. He pointed to the dire state of education in major cities like Chicago, where only 12% of poor children in third grade can read at grade level. Brat argued that the Democrats’ control over education has resulted in a system that fails to serve the most vulnerable communities. “They own the turf, and we don’t,” Brat stated, emphasizing the need for conservatives and populists to reclaim education as a key battleground.</p>
<p>Both White and Brat believe that by uniting around the America First platform, Americans can overcome the divisions that threaten to tear the nation apart and chart a new course for the future.</p>
