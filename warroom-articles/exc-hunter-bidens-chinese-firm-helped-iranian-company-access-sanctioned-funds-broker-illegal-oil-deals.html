<p><strong>A Chinese Communist Party conglomerate linked to President Joe Biden’s son and high-level foreign policy advisors conspired to help an Iranian company retrieve funds from a sanctioned bank in addition to brokering deals on behalf of sanctioned Iranian oil companies.</strong></p>
<p>The company, CEFC China Energy, counted President Biden’s son, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/hunter-biden-offered-10-million-133820212.html">Hunter</a> Biden, as its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjcoKPEjPmBAxUcM1kFHRHICt0QFnoECAYQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenationalpulse.com%2Farchive-post%2Fhunter-biden-cefc-managing-director%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw046JtPlwZ3-xtsTrgrrhtk&amp;opi=89978449">Managing</a> Director and has <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/archive-post/kurt-campbell-ccp-hunter-biden-ties/">hosted</a> current National Security Council Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell as a keynote speaker at its events. Campbell has been <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH8q6ZjfmBAxVGFVkFHYZzAbYQFnoECA4QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2023-09-07%2Fbiden-asia-czar-campbell-is-top-candidate-for-key-diplomat-post&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kS5Hhe3eZ1F_Np0VDbJBz&amp;opi=89978449">identified</a> as Biden’s “Asia Czar.”</p>
<p>CEFC China Energy’s illicit involvement in the Iranian oil industry have been tacitly acknowledged by the mainstream media, with <em>The New York Times </em>publishing an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/business/cefc-china-weapons-iran.html">article</a>, “Chinese Oil Company Official Talked Arms Deals and Evading Iran Sanctions, U.S. Says,” in October 2018.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s ties to the company, however, and its potential ramifications for influencing the policies of the Biden administration were omitted.</p>
<p>These unearthed ties come amidst President Joe Biden’s decision to release $6 billion in funds to the Iranian regime, shortly before its proxy force, Hamas, attacked Israel.</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> article reveals how Patrick Ho, the Director of CEFC China Energy whom Hunter Biden has described as his personal business partner and also the “spy chief of China,” was “looking for ways to dodge American sanctions on Iran” on behalf of the company.</p>
<p>“The prosecutors also accused Mr. Ho of exploring whether CEFC could serve as a middleman for an Iranian company to gain access to funds from a Chinese bank under international sanctions. […] In 2014, he discussed the possibility that CEFC could act as a go-between for an Iranian company looking to buy precious metals in Hong Kong using money that had been blocked in China, according to email excerpts provided by prosecutors. At the time, Iran was under international sanctions for accelerating its nuclear program,” continued the article.</p>
<p>The revelations were revealed during the trial of Ho, who was ultimately sentenced to three years in prison by a U.S. federal court for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and money laundering. Court <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2023/07/17/i-can-get-any-source-on-the-planet-the-pre-history-of-gal-lufts-pre-whistleblower-indictment/?print=print">documents</a> showed Ho meeting with the Chairman of CEFC China Energy to discuss the “Iranian connection,” which dealt with Iranian funds being held under sanction in a Chinese bank as he later clarified in the email:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Iranian Connection . . . Iran has money in a Bank in china which is under sanction. Iran wishes to purchase precious metal with this money. The precious metal is available through a Bank in HK which cannot accept money from the Bank in China which holds the money but is under sanction. The Iranian agent is looking for a Chinese company acting as a middle man in such transactions and will pay commission. (details to be presented orally) The Iranian connection has strong urge to establish trading relationship with us in oil and products . . . .”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1304836/dl?inline">indictment</a> of Gal Luft, a Biden family whistleblower, provides even more details surrounding CEFC China Energy’s Iranian business dealings. Luft has been accused of “broker[ing] deals for Iranian oil, without authorization, in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.” Additionally, he instructed his colleagues to avoid using the word “Iran,” instead referring to the oil as coming from Brazil.</p>
<p>As early as 2015, Luft and CEFC members began conversing about potentially connecting with Iranian oil officials, with emails showing a CEFC member asking Luft “Can you send me more info on the Iranians” ahead of a conference. Luft provided the requested information, even attaching a PowerPoint entitled “Presentation to Potential Partners: Iran Petroleum Investments.”</p>
<p>The following year, Luft was forwarded an email asking “whether there could be any interest from our Chinese buyers (CEFC, HUOC etc al) in “volumes of Iranian Light Crude” oil, including a link to the website of the National Iranian Oil Company.</p>
<p>Luft promised that he would “check,” following up with an email confirming “I have positive interesT. $2.50[.J will develop further[.] pls refer to as Brazil.” Luft was ultimately sent an “offer for NIOC crude oil from a petroleum company addressed to CEFC China,” according to the indictment, which reveals that CEFC China Energy’s relationship with Iranian oil officials continued.</p>
