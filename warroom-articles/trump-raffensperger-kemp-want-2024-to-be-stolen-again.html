<p>President Trump honored members of the Georgia State Election Board fighting for transparency in elections, while simultaneously warning that Brad Raffensperger and Brian Kemp want a repeat of 2020’s failed and corrupt election in the Peach State this November.</p>
<p>President Trump acknowledged Dr. Janice Johnston, Rick Jeffares, and Janelle King who were in attendance at his Saturday rally at Georgia State University’s Convocation Center.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnston, who has been at the <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1787931381504307566?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>forefront</span></a> for holding state and Fulton County officials accountable for their misrepresentations about 2020, received a standing ovation. She told President Trump, in the wake of being shot in an assassination attempt, his courage is contagious.</p>
<p>"Your courage is contagious, too,” he said.</p>
<p>President Trump specifically praised the group for voting to <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1810768042248536298?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>approve</span></a> a rule change that requires the votes to be hand counted by three poll officers at the precinct level every day of voting to ensure the numbers match with the machines.</p>
<p>"Who could be against that?” President Trump said.</p>
<p>Maybe the ones still covering up 2020. The three hand counts at the precinct level <a href="https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/"><span>differed so significantly</span></a> that President Trump’s Election Day totals were off by nearly 50 percent in some cases. The tabulation machines undercounted these votes both times. Phillip Stark, a renowned statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who created the risk limiting audit, said the "large, unexplained differences among these results” left voters with no confidence their voters were "counted at all, much less counted as cast.”</p>
<p>The second machine count and the hand count audit were thousands of votes short when they tried to recreate their purported results in Fulton County. Two State Election Board cases, SEB2021-181 and SEB2023-025, have proven the hand count audit included over 4,081 false votes for Joe Biden, and that the second machine count included thousands of duplicate votes. However, the Secretary of State’s office has tried to sweep both cases under the rug. Though Kemp and his office are keenly aware of the details of the fraudulent hand count, since they are the ones who confirmed Joe Rossi’s findings and sent a letter to the State Election Board which prompted the opening of the SEB2021-181 case, little has been done to ensure it can’t happen again in 2024.</p>
<p>Raffensperger and his general counsel Charlene McGowan are still claiming all three counts matched. The final count includes only 506,948 votes, far less than the certified 527,925 that includes 17,852 missing ballot images from tabulators that do not exist, and the aforementioned duplicates. McGowan falsely claimed it was "inconclusive” whether or not the over 3,125 duplicates were counted, when in fact there is evidence that not only were they counted, but were <a href="https://warroom.org/report-3930-duplicates-in-fulton-county-in-2020-were-intentional-fraud/"><span>intentionally and fraudulently</span></a>inserted into the official results. Removing the false votes from both cases would be enough to alter the outcome of 2020, which was claimed to be decided by 11,779 votes.</p>
<p>The State Election Board has an <a href="https://x.com/kevinmoncla/status/1819921814933385444?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>opportunity</span></a> to continue the investigation into SEB2023-025, which documented all of these major discrepancies and the fact that the results were sent to an outside "consultant” working for the Elections Group, a <a href="https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/"><span>shadowy organization</span></a> that "chose Fulton County” when they popped up in cities in the major Swing States during the pivotal 2020 Election. The matter will be brought up at the next Board meeting on Tuesday, Aug. 6.</p>
<p>President Trump called out Raffensperger and Kemp for wanting Georgia to be stolen again.</p>
<p>"Raffensperger ought to make sure that the vote is honest,” he said. "They don’t want the vote to be honest. In my opinion, they want us to lose. And we can’t let that happen.”</p>
