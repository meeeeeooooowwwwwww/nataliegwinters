<p>Rabbi Pesach Wolicki’s recent comments during a discussion with Ben Harnwell and Ret. Col. Derek Harvey on Thursday’s WarRoom touched on critical topics such as NGOs, Western civilization, and election dynamics. The Rabbi’s reflections offer a stark critique of corporate media narratives and highlight his perspective on Israel’s role in the broader context of Western values.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"The Western World has kind of forgotten the purpose of actual victory,” Wolicki stated. Drawing a comparison to post-World War II demilitarization and de-radicalization of Germany and Japan, he argued that these processes led to lasting peace and stability. "Unequivocal victory is the only chance we have to really have peaceful relations with our Arab neighbors,” he added.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Wolicki addressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, describing many as “bloated NGOs” that pose as international watchdogs but, in reality, are part of a broader narrative that undermines Israel’s position.</p>
<p>He argued that these organizations, including the UN and the International Criminal Court, have been instrumental in perpetuating false narratives about the conflict. According to Wolicki, the media and these NGOs have propagated two key lies about Israel: the notion that insufficient humanitarian aid is reaching Gaza and the claim of excessive civilian casualties.</p>
<p>He rejected these claims robustly, stating, “Israel has nothing to gain by withholding humanitarian aid.” He pointed out that aid is reaching Gaza in substantial quantities, with reports showing an ample supply of food and essentials. "There’s no humanitarian aid issue there except that it’s enriching Hamas,” Wolicki asserted.</p>
<p>Wolicki said that he believes that the humanitarian crisis narrative is a fabrication intended to harm Israel’s reputation. Similarly, he challenged the narrative of high civilian casualties, highlighting that Israel has taken unprecedented steps to minimize harm. Wolicki cited John Spencer from West Point, who has praised Israel for its efforts to avoid civilian casualties despite the complexities of urban warfare.</p>
<p>Wolicki’s critique extended beyond the immediate conflict to a broader examination of Western civilization. He suggested that the Western world has become complacent in its approach to conflict, moving away from seeking definitive victories. He argued that this trend has undermined efforts to achieve lasting peace and resolve conflicts effectively.</p>
<p>Wolicki’s remarks reflect a broader critique of current international strategies and highlight a call for a return to decisive action. He suggested that without an unequivocal defeat of Hamas, any attempts at peace or normalization would be futile. His comments reflect a belief that the global community’s current approach to conflict management, often characterized by ceasefires and de-escalation, fails to address the root causes of radicalization and conflict.</p>
<p>In discussing Israel’s fight, Wolicki framed it as part of a larger struggle for Western civilization. He criticized American conservatives for not fully recognizing this context, asserting that Israel’s battle is symbolic of a broader clash against radical ideologies that threaten Western values. "Israel is fighting a battle for Judeo-Christian Western civilization,” Wolicki declared. He emphasized that this fight is not just about Israel but about the preservation of Western values against what he perceives as encroaching radical ideologies.</p>
