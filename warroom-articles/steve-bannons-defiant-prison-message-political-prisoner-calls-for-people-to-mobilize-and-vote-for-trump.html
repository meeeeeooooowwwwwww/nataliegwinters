<p>Steve Bannon, currently imprisoned as a political prisoner, has issued a defiant message from behind bars, urging his followers to take action to secure victory in the 2024 General Election. With his release unlikely until just before the voting concludes, Bannon’s message is a rallying cry for intensified voter mobilization efforts.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Harry Enten of CNN gave it away the other day—only a 1% change in battleground states will bring victory for Trump. This will come from low-propensity, low-information voters—Christians being the easiest group to get, although all of it is hard. This is also where the Swifties come in on the other side. We MUST galvanize folks to work on get-out-the-vote canvassing and phone banks every day. Victory is right there,” Bannon relayed to his audience through Grace Chong on Monday’s WarRoom program. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bannon’s statement referenced an explosive Monday morning poll that shows great movement for the America First agenda:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CNN’s Harry Enten Sounds Alarm About Harris’ Vanishing Lead In ‘Very Pivotal’ Swing State <a href="https://t.co/cRzGqadjUD">https://t.co/cRzGqadjUD</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dailycaller</a> They are gonna steal it again in Pennsylvania and claim that TRUMP never got the black vote but TRUMP won't need PA to win.</p>
<p>— edward boucher (@flatfishbill) <a href="https://twitter.com/flatfishbill/status/1833163055728861381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the statement from his prison cell on Monday’s WarRoom, Bannon highlighted the critical role of grassroots activism in overcoming his political persecution by getting themselves engaged in the voting process.  He emphasized the moment’s urgency, stating,<strong> "Victory is within reach, but only if we work on it.”</strong></p>
<h4>FROM STEVE BANNON TO THE WARROOM-YOU BETTER VOTE:</h4>
<p>Bannon’s message from prison accentuates the urgency with which the audience must face their daily tasks to save the American Republic.  He underscores that engaging<a href="https://warroom.org/adversarial-unity-of-efforts-patti-lyman-urges-gop-to-focus-on-simple-compelling-reasons-to-vote-trump/"> low-information voters</a> and mobilizing the <a href="https://warroom.org/dr-ben-carson-shine-thy-light-why-christians-must-vote-against-the-darkness/">Christian</a> demographic are essential to swaying key battleground states.</p>
<h4>GET THE BILL BLASTER APP AND START YOUR DUTY TO BANNON- TODAY WITH THE SAVE ACT:</h4>
<p>As Chong described, central to Bannon’s strategy is the use of the <a href="https://billblasterapp.org/">BillBlaster App,</a> a tool designed to contact Congress members directly. Chong detailed how Bill Blaster provides a streamlined method for voters to reach out to their representatives, bypassing traditional switchboards to engage with congressional offices directly.</p>
<p>"It is an app which you can find in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. Just type in BillBlaster, one word,” Chong explained. The app allows users to make calls and provides contact information, including direct phone lines and email addresses for all Senators and Congress members.</p>
<p>With just a slim margin needed for victory, Chong stresses, "We need to ensure that the<a href="https://warroom.org/scott-perry-passing-the-save-act-now-is-crucial-for-election-integrity-and-restoring-trust-with-trumps-support-key-to-success/"> SAFE Act</a> gets passed. It is mission critical.”</p>
<p>For more on the importance of the SAVE Act, according to WarRoom experts:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://warroom.org/securing-elections-the-save-act-and-the-crucial-role-of-the-continuing-resolution-urgent/">Securing Elections: The SAVE Act and the Crucial Role of the Continuing Resolution-URGENT</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The BillBlaster app, described by Chong as "a directory of all the Senators and Congressmen,” is positioned as a pivotal asset in this mobilization effort. "It’s free. Make sure to download it and fire up their phone lines,” Chong urged. This tool is an indispensable resource for grassroots activists seeking to influence legislative priorities and ensure that Trump-endorsed candidates receive the support they need.</p>
<p>Navarro’s  Monday WarRoom commentary with Chong aligns with Bannon’s sentiments, emphasizing the need for increased funding and support for Trump-endorsed Senate candidates. He criticized the Republican Senate Committee for withholding resources from pivotal races, which could undermine efforts to secure a Republican majority in the Senate. Navarro’s call to action appeals to use BillBlaster to pressure Senate representatives and secure critical victories in the upcoming elections.</p>

<p>With the stakes higher than ever, Bannon’s rallying cry from behind bars serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of grassroots involvement and voter engagement in the upcoming 2024 General Election.</p>
