<p>In November 2023, on the WarRoom, before he was being held as a political prisoner, Steve Bannon addressed crucial issues facing the GOP. He emphasized the strategic focus needed for the upcoming November 2024 election.</p>
<p>In his broadcast, Bannon sharply criticized the current GOP leadership for their handling of fiscal issues and election integrity, urging a radical shift in strategy and attitude. And he also reminded his audience about the importance of their vigilance in voting.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Turning to election strategy, Bannon stressed the importance of robust grassroots activism to support Trump’s campaign. He pointed out the GOP’s recent failures, including the loss of the White House in 2020 and the narrow Republican majority in the House, noting that “Trump will deliver the votes” and calling for a concerted effort to prevent any election manipulation. He emphasized that the focus should be on ensuring that votes are counted accurately, not just through elaborate theories but through practical measures: “We need to make sure that they’re not stolen.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As Bannon transitioned from his regular national commentator to a top podcaster and a more hands-on leader within GOP grassroots efforts in his force multiplier academy, he reminded us of the critical need for organized local action to complement Trump’s efforts.</p>
<p>He pointed to the importance of uniting under the local party structures and emphasized that addressing local issues is vital for broader electoral success. “The grassroots want to make a difference,” Bannon concluded, urging supporters to engage actively in local politics to drive national change.</p>
<p>During the segment, Bannon condemned the idea of a clean Continuing Resolution (CR) in Congress, labeling it an unacceptable compromise. He argued that “a clean CR is impossible” and warned against the disastrous effects of maintaining a two-trillion-dollar deficit, asserting, “You have two trillion dollars last Thursday was a debacle.” He criticized the lack of meaningful fiscal cuts and expressed skepticism about optimistic financial projections, saying, “I did an investment banking long enough to know when it is BS.”</p>
<p>Bannon also urged Republicans to break free from fear and media influence. “Stop being petrified by the unit party,” he said, encouraging GOP members to engage boldly in their duties and make their voices heard. He criticized some members’ “petrified” nature and called for a more assertive, more decisive approach.</p>
<p>BANNON WAS RIGHT</p>
<p>Highlighting the broader implications of current policies, Bannon warned of a looming economic and geopolitical crisis, comparing the situation to a biblical apocalypse: “You gotta start at the beginning, go to the end, go. The last part, is that where we are expanding third world war.”</p>
<p>Bannon’s remarks paint a picture of urgency and strategic recalibration as Republicans prepare for the 2024 elections, with a clear focus on reclaiming lost ground and ensuring the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>Here is a flashback from Bannon, now a political prisoner, who 8 months ago was telling the WarRoom to get ready to go and vote:</p>
