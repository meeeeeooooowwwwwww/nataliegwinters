<p>The daughter of Hugh Auchincloss â€" selected to be Anthony Fauci’s temporary successor at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases â€" works for a leading Food and Drug Administration consulting firm advising American pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Adding to the conflict of interest, she has authored strategy papers for the company focused on COVID-19 regulations.</p>
<p>Hugh Auchincloss has been Fauci’s number two at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) agency since 2006, giving him considerable influence over the federal agency’s vaccine policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and push to <a href="https://warroom.org/2022/12/10/faucis-succcesor-spearheaded-collaboration-with-ccp-on-gof-research/">collaborate</a> more with the Chinese Communist Party on research.</p>
<p>He is also the aide Fauci sent panicked emails to about the gain of function research occurring in Wuhan in the early days of the pandemic. In a recent deposition, Fauci also identified Auchincloss as responsible for reversing a ban on federal funds supporting gain of function research in the case of Ralph Baric â€" who <a href="https://warroom.org/2022/11/30/fauci-taps-wuhan-institute-of-virologys-longtime-gain-of-function-research-partner/">shared</a> his deadly research tactics with scientists in Wuhan.</p>
<p>The War Room can reveal another conflict of interest held by the Fauci successor, as his daughter, Kalah Auchincloss, is the Executive Vice President <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalah-auchincloss-1b866526/">and</a> Deputy General Counsel of Greenleaf Health.</p>
<p>Dubbed by the media as the “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/11/where-do-former-officials-go-after-fda-look-down-k-street/">most</a> influential FDA consulting firm you've never heard of,” the company describes itself as “a leading FDA regulatory consulting firm that provides strategic and technical guidance to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies.”</p>
<p>The FDA is the federal agency responsible for the approval of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>Greenleaf Health’s advisory services appear to intersect with the aforementioned market, as it works on behalf of clients to provide assistance with “drug and biological products.”</p>
<figure><figcaption>Company’s Areas Of Business.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“<a href="https://www.greenleafhealth.com/services/drugs/">Greenleaf's</a> respected FDA experts provide a vital perspective to clients on the complex process of bringing new therapeutics to market,” explains a summary of the practice. The Executive Vice President of the firm’s drug and biological products branch is an alum of the FDA's Office of Vaccine Research and Review and claims “vaccines” are an area of “expertise” in her professional <a href="https://www.greenleafhealth.com/three-former-fda-officials-join-greenleaf-team/">bio</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which also retains a Cell &amp; Gene Therapy team, is also involved in <a href="https://www.greenleafhealth.com/services/regulatory-policy-services/">Regulatory</a> Policy Services</p>
<p>“Greenleaf's regulatory policy services are designed to support the needs of large and small clients as they navigate FDA regulations and regulatory policies,” explains the company.</p>
<p>Kalah Auchincloss is also a member of Greenleaf health’s <a href="https://www.greenleafhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022.09.08-COMPLETE-Capabilities-Deck-compressed.pdf">Litigation</a> Support Services team, which provides “guidance when grappling with FDA regulatory issues.”</p>
<figure><figcaption>Company Pitch Deck.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://archive.vn/CLpra">Indicating</a> that the former NIAID Deputy Director has worked on COVID-19-related issues, she authored a <a href="https://www.greenleafhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/201210-regulatory-landscape-of-fda-inspectional-activities-during-covid-final.pdf">paper</a> on behalf of the company: “Regulatory Landscape Analysis â€" FDA Inspectional Activities During COVID-19”</p>
<p>“If you would like more information on the current inspections policy landscape at FDA, or have any opportunities that would benefit from a regulatory risk assessment, please do not hesitate to reach out,” concludes the paper which explains FDA inspections of pharmaceutical companies’ manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.greenleafhealth.com/member/kalah-auchincloss-jd-mph/">bio</a> on the company’s website also reveals an extensive government career, including a stint at the FDA as a Deputy Chief of Staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Kalah has 15 years of food and drug legal, policy, and regulatory experience at the FDA, on Capitol Hill, and in the private sector. Kalah spent six years at the FDA, including as Deputy Chief of Staff for two FDA Commissioners, Dr. Robert Califf and Dr. Scott Gottlieb. As Deputy Chief of Staff, Kalah worked with senior FDA leadership to manage crises, develop policy decisions, implement communications strategies, and liaise with the Department of Health and Human Services, the White House, and other agencies. Kalah was also a primary point of contact in the immediate Office of the Commissioner for the six FDA Centers and other components of the Commissioner's Office.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She has also participated in FDANews panels <a href="https://www.fdanews.com/speakerspart1diimpactcovid19">titled</a> “Data Integrity in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond” and has been quoted by news outlets such as Bloomberg about the rollout of COVID-19 boosters:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I don't think for patients who are going to get boosters or the doctors who are prescribing them, it will really mean anything," Kalah Auchincloss, a former FDA deputy chief of staff who's now executive vice president of regulatory compliance and deputy general counsel at FDA regulatory consulting firm Greenleaf Health, said. "From a practical perspective, it shouldn't necessarily have many implications."</p></blockquote>
<p>Fellow Greenleaf Health employees have <a href="https://theprint.in/health/pfizer-to-seek-emergency-us-fda-authorisation-for-its-covid-vaccine-today/548868/">defended</a> the FDA’s transparency, insisting it has operated under a reasonable time frame to authorize COVID-19 vaccines:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I don't find that time frame to be unreasonable in light of the amount of data the agency needs to analyze and in order to ensure full participation by all stakeholders in the advisory committee," said John Taylor, who served as counselor to the head of the FDA during the Obama administration and now works as a consultant at Greenleaf Health. "It ensures that the agency can conduct a well run, well attended advisory committee in order to ensure maximum transparency, which I think will be an important factor in patients' willingness to take the vaccine."</p></blockquote>
