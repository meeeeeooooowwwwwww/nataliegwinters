<div>
<p>In a fiery segment titled “It’s Hammer Time on the War Room,” Josh Hammer from Newsweek joined Ben Harnwell to discuss his recent article and dissect an appalling Lincoln Project advertisement targeting Steve Bannon in prison.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This is a highly, highly disreputable outfit. I think that would be a charitable way of saying it. I have far  less charitable, more colorful things to perhaps off camera about them.  They created this new advertisement. They are not just mocking Steve Bannon but essentially taunting him and saying that they hope that he gets raped in prison- if I understand the ad. I’m pretty sure that’s what they’re saying there. And you know, if there are any  boundaries or any sense of ethics or anything remotely approximating ethics when it comes to politics in the year 2024, This is over that line.  I would not wish my worst political enemies to be raped. I would never in a million years think that or -let alone produce a video to that effect against Nancy. Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, you name it—none of these people. There are some lines you do not cross and that is the whole point of being the news,” Hammer told Harnwell. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the WarRoom segment, Hammer didn’t mince words, describing the Lincoln Project as a “disgusting outfit” filled with scandalous figures. He criticized their history, including allegations of pedophilia against John Weaver, a former member. The advertisement in question mocked Bannon and insinuated horrifying acts in prison, crossing a moral line that even political adversaries condemned.</p>
<p>Hammer emphasized that the backlash against the Lincoln Project’s ad transcended partisan lines, with figures from both anti-Trump and pro-Trump camps denouncing it. He pointed out the hypocrisy of a supposedly progressive group resorting to such distasteful tactics while claiming moral superiority. Hammer expressed his disdain for the Lincoln Project’s actions, highlighting the broader consensus that the ad was not just offensive but morally bankrupt.</p>
<p>The ad, which was immediately pinned to the top of the Twitter feed for  The Lincoln Project, has been unpinned but does not appear to have been removed after being up for three days.  Many people said that the video footage for their ad depicted Bannon being raped in prison, to the glee of the group members.</p>
<p>Harnwell echoed Hammer’s sentiments, decrying the Lincoln Project’s lack of decency and accusing them of grifting off anti-Trump sentiment while displaying no moral high ground. They discussed the broader implications of such ads on political discourse, noting that the public backlash signaled a significant overstep by the Lincoln Project, damaging whatever credibility they might have claimed.</p>
<p>Both speakers underscored that the ad’s graphic nature went beyond mere political rivalry, touching on fundamental ethical boundaries that should not be crossed in civilized discourse. They concluded that the Lincoln Project’s actions were repulsive and indicative of a deeper problem within contemporary political campaigning, where ethics are sacrificed for shock value and partisan gain.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding the Lincoln Project’s ad underscores ongoing ethical debates in political messaging and the condemnation of extreme tactics even within the adversarial landscape of American politics. This incident is a stark reminder of the dangers of descending into personal attacks and ethical compromises in pursuing political goals.</p>
<p>Their critique highlights the broader implications of such tactics on public trust and political discourse. It reinforces the need for ethical standards in political campaigning and the responsibility of political actors to uphold decency and integrity in their communications.</p>
<p>The fallout from the Lincoln Project’s ad targeting Steve Bannon reveals deeper tensions within contemporary political activism. It also reflects broader ethical debates about the boundaries of political discourse and the consequences of crossing them.</p>
