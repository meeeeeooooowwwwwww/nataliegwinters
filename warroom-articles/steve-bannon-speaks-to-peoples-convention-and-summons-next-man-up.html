<p>Steve Bannon’s historic speech at the Turning Point Action event in Detroit, Michigan, on June 15, for the People’s Convention, can be described as a prophetic call to action aimed at mobilizing support for the 2024 election. Bannon’s remarks were characterized by a painful critique of the current political landscape, exposing a deep sense of urgency and a call for radical change to protect the civil liberties of the American people.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“You’re exactly like the Patriots of 1774 and 1775, you’re fighting a tyranny and you’re fighting monopolistic economic power,” Bannon stated, adding:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Are you prepared to leave it all on the battlefield?”  Steve Bannon asked an enthusiastic crowd of young people, ending his speech with, “Ladies and Gentlemen, it is very simple- Victory or Death.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bannon began by illustrating the importance of the younger generation’s involvement in the political process, suggesting that the youth in countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are rising against their governments, inspired by a desire for freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>This international perspective set the stage for his argument about the global fight against tyranny.</p>
<p>A significant portion of Bannon’s speech was dedicated to election integrity, a hallmark of democracy. He pushed for a safe and true election representing the consent of the governed. Bannon called on his audience to prepare for a decisive battle, framing the upcoming election as a crucial moment for the Republic’s survival. He asserted, “If they steal this election and they fully intend to steal the election, our Republic ends.”</p>
<p>He called on them to be the next man or woman up to defend liberty.</p>
<p>“The only way we lose is if we quit. They know that. This movement is ascendant. We are two-thirds of the nation, maybe 75 percent of the nation. We just have to get the word out to them and that’s you. And when anybody falls, when anybody’s taken off, whether they’re put in jail, whether they’re bankrupt, whether they are de-platformed, de-banked, they lost their law license, you must step into the breach. Nobody else. Check yourself.”</p>
<p>Bannon’s critique extended to various government institutions, particularly the legal and political systems. He alleged that these systems have been weaponized against political opponents, with a particular focus on the prosecution of Donald Trump and his allies. “President Trump is now eligible for 700 years in prison. They want him to serve all of it,” Bannon remarked, arguing that these actions are part of an effort to prevent the Populist MAGA movement from gaining power, regardless of electoral outcomes.</p>
<p>A major theme of Bannon’s speech was the need for significant reform of federal institutions. He called for the dismantling and reconstruction of entities like the FBI and DOJ, which he likened to an “American Gestapo.” This bold stance was coupled with a historical analogy, where Bannon compared the current political struggle to the American Revolution, casting his audience as modern-day patriots fighting against tyranny.</p>
<p>Immigration and border security were also central to Bannon’s address. He emphasized the necessity of securing the southern border and deporting illegal immigrants, framing this as a critical aspect of national security and economic stability. “We’re going to deport every single illegal alien that came here by Joe Biden and they are going back home,” he declared.</p>
<p>Throughout his speech, Bannon stressed the importance of unity and perseverance within the America First movement. He encouraged his audience to continue fighting regardless of the personal sacrifices, including imprisonment or financial ruin.</p>
<p>Bannon leads with experience and leaves everything on the table himself. The participants at Turning Point were on their feet enthusiastically supporting Bannon, with great admiration.</p>
<p>Bannon framed the movement’s efforts as part of a larger historical struggle for freedom, telling the audience they are responsible for upholding the liberty legacy of past patriots. “The only way we lose is if we quit,” he proclaimed. “If you commit to that, if your task and purpose is saving your country, this country will be saved.”</p>
<p>Bannon’s speech passionately appealed to his audience to commit fully to the political battle ahead, framing it as a matter of “victory or death.” His rhetoric was designed to inspire and mobilize, painting the 2024 election as a pivotal moment in American history.</p>
