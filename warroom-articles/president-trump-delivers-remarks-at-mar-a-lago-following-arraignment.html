<p><span>President Trump addressed a large group of supporters and media Tuesday evening in the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago. His remarks were made just hours after he was arraigned in New York on an indictment of 34 felony counts for falsification of business records.</span></p>
<p><span>President Trump opened his speech by thanking the audience of supporters. "We have to save our country. God bless you all. I never thought anything like this could happen in America… The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,” he said as the crowd applauded.</span></p>
<p><span>During his remarks President Trump highlighted his commitment to the American people and the judicial Witch Hunt including the Russia hoax and FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.</span></p>
<p><span>The crowd booed at the mention of DA Bragg and Attorney General Letitia James, both of whom campaigned on weaponizing the judicial system against the President.</span></p>
<p><span>"This is a persecution not an investigation,” said the President.He went on to explain </span><span>"There is no case,” and called the indictment "ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span>He said the real criminal is the District Attorney who leaked information regarding the charges prior to the indictment being unsealed or President Trump’s knowledge of the 34 counts of falsifying business records.</span></p>
<p><span>He took the time to point out election interference through the social media censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story and the impact it had on the 2020 election. Joe Biden’s destruction of the U.S. economy and military were also touched on during the President’s address.</span></p>
<p><span>President Trump appeared Tuesday afternoon in a Manhattan courtroom in front of Judge Juan Merchan who previously presided over two criminal tax fraud cases involving Trump’s real estate company and his former CFO. The charge of falsification of business records can be prosecuted in New York state as a misdemeanor however, Bragg’s office bumped up all the charges to the lowest level of felonies in the New York state penal code – Class E felony. </span></p>
<p><span>The indictment does not specify what laws President Trump broke. In a press conference following the arraignment DA Bragg pushed back against reporters questioning over the lack of details saying, "the law does not so require.”</span></p>
<p><span>Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges.</span></p>
