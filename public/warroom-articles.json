    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>While hurricane-ravaged Appalachia is left out in the cold illegal migrants live comfortably in taxpayer-funded hotels, sparking fury over government priorities.</p>\n<p>Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam called out the former Biden administration on Friday’s WarRoom for its stark neglect of disaster-stricken Americans in Appalachian communities while lavishing care on illegal immigrants. Their remarks paint a damning picture of government incompetence and misplaced priorities.</p>\n<p>Watch a quick clip of the discussion:</p>\n<h3>Four Months, Little Progress</h3>\n<p>In Western North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, many hurricane victims are still living in tents through a brutal winter. FEMA’s response? Almost nonexistent. Bergquam noted that FEMA representatives are scarce, and their assistance—when it happens—moves at a snail’s pace. \"Four months in, and they’ve set up only five trailers,” one local commissioner shared.</p>\n<p>Instead of quick relief, the community has relied on grassroots efforts. Bergquam highlighted local organizations and churches stepping up where FEMA has failed. \"This has all been donation-driven,” he said.</p>\n<h3>\"Rebuilding Ukraine Faster Than Appalachia”</h3>\n<p>The most searing critique came from Bergquam, who compared the administration’s priorities: \"They’re rebuilding Ukraine faster than they’re rebuilding parts of Appalachia.” His remarks underscored the glaring disparity between international aid and domestic disaster relief.</p>\n<p>Bannon chimed in, asking why FEMA’s usual presence was missing. \"In California, FEMA is wall-to-wall. Where are they here? No jackets, no vehicles, no boots on the ground,” he pressed. The locals answered plainly: FEMA has abandoned them.</p>\n<h3>Hotel Rooms for Illegals, Tents for Americans</h3>\n<p>The contrast is jarring. Bergquam reported live from a newly renovated Chicago hotel packed with illegal immigrants. These individuals enjoy warm rooms, three meals a day, cash cards, and other benefits—all courtesy of American taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, disaster victims in Appalachia struggle to survive in freezing temperatures. \"It’s animal-like conditions,” Bannon exclaimed. Bergquam noted the irony: \"Joe Biden and the Democrats abandoned these people but rolled out the red carpet for an organized invasion of illegals.”</p>\n<h3>A Political Turning Point?</h3>\n<p>Bergquam credited President Trump’s decision to visit these devastated areas as a sign of leadership. \"President Trump puts America First,” he said. Trump’s visit and his team’s efforts aim to spotlight these forgotten communities.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration, however, continues to face criticism for prioritizing border crises over its constitutional duty to protect American citizens. As Bergquam put it, \"The government’s primary job is to protect its citizens—not to aid an invasion.”</p>\n<p>The sharp divide between the treatment of hurricane victims and illegal immigrants highlights deep flaws in the administration’s priorities. While citizens suffer in tents, migrants enjoy taxpayer-funded luxury. The question remains: When will American leaders prioritize their own people?</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this full clip of the conversation from Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Steve Bannon And Ben Bergquam Compare The Treatment Of Illegals To NC Disaster Victims</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>Revolutions in Reporting: Beattie’s Investigations and the Need for Kash Patel’s Leadership at the FBI</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/DarrenJBeattie\">Darren Beattie</a>’s investigative work at <a href=\"https://revolver.news/newsfeed/\">Revolver News</a> has illuminated one of the most controversial aspects of the January 6 Capitol riot: the pipe bomb incident. His relentless investigation has uncovered what he believes to be a series of deliberate and suspicious actions by federal agencies, raising questions about the integrity of the government’s narrative.</p>\n<p>Beattie appeared on Thursday’s WarRoom to give an update to his work:</p>\n<p>On the WarRoom with Steve Bannon, Beattie argues that the government’s handling of the January 6 events, particularly the pipe bombs, was not just flawed—it was a coordinated effort to mislead the public. This perspective has placed Beattie at the center of a growing movement of skeptical Americans who are beginning to question the official story. His reporting on the pipe bomb investigation has been groundbreaking, and it has made him a key figure in the effort to uncover what happened that day.</p>\n<p><strong>A Timeline of Inconsistent Investigations: The Pipe Bomb Cover-Up</strong></p>\n<p>Beattie’s <a href=\"https://revolver.news/?s=Pipe+Bomb\">deep dive into the pipe bomb investigation for Revolver News</a> paints a picture of an investigation that was shut down prematurely. According to his research, the FBI initially conducted a thorough investigation into the bombs that were discovered near the Capitol on January 6, 2021. However, something went wrong around May of 2021, when the investigation mysteriously went dark. Beattie describes this as a significant turning point—one that raised alarm bells for him and other investigators. The FBI, after initially chasing leads and reviewing surveillance footage, essentially abandoned the case. Beattie’s reporting suggests that the FBI, at least in the early months after January 6, was on the trail of key evidence but was either obstructed or ordered to halt its efforts.</p>\n<p>The fact that the investigation died down so early is especially troubling for Beattie. Not only does it imply that critical leads were ignored, but it also casts doubt on the entire narrative surrounding the pipe bombs. To Beattie, the lack of progress in the investigation signals that the FBI may have been involved in a deliberate cover-up. He even claims that other agencies, like the ATF and Secret Service, were complicit in suppressing evidence. This raises questions about the involvement of higher government officials, something that Beattie argues could have been orchestrated at the very top of the administration.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump’s Role in the Investigation</strong></p>\n<p>Beattie’s work has also drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly commented on the issues surrounding January 6. Trump’s statements have supported much of Beattie’s findings, particularly his assertion that the FBI already knows who planted the bombs. Trump has gone further to suggest that the real story behind the pipe bombs is far more damning than anyone in government wants to admit. Beattie believes that Trump’s involvement is crucial, as his statements validate the research and point to the more significant issue of government cover-ups.</p>\n<p>The public nature of Trump’s comments has helped amplify the concerns raised by Beattie and others in the investigative community. Trump has long been a critic of the FBI and the broader intelligence community, and his vocal support for Beattie’s findings has only intensified scrutiny of the investigation. Beattie notes that Trump’s focus on the pipe bombs signals that the former president is aware of the more profound implications of this issue. By speaking out, Trump is acknowledging that what happened on January 6 was not a spontaneous insurrection but rather a planned operation involving multiple government agencies.</p>\n<p><strong>The Call for Kash Patel’s Leadership</strong></p>\n<p>For Beattie, the solution to this investigation’s deadlock lies in the leadership of Kash Patel, a former aide to President Trump and a staunch critic of the FBI’s handling of several high-profile cases. Patel has become a symbol of hope for many who want to see justice in the investigation of January 6. Beattie is hopeful that if Patel is confirmed as the next FBI director, the final pieces of the puzzle will be put together. Patel has the experience and integrity needed to oversee a thorough investigation into the events of that day.</p>\n<p>Beattie believes that Patel’s leadership would signal a turning point in the FBI’s case handling. According to Beattie, Patel’s appointment would be crucial in uncovering the truth behind the pipe bombs and the broader January 6 narrative. He argues that the FBI’s previous inaction and possible involvement in a cover-up can only be addressed under Patel’s direction. Beattie also notes that Patel’s history of standing up to the establishment makes him the ideal person to challenge the deep state’s influence over key investigations.</p>\n<p><strong>The Broader Implications: A Systemic Problem</strong></p>\n<p>Beattie’s investigation into the pipe bombs is not just about exposing a cover-up—it’s about understanding the broader implications for American democracy. Beattie argues that the pipe bomb incident is just one piece of a much larger puzzle involving corruption and manipulation at the highest levels of government. The investigation can potentially expose systemic problems within the FBI, the ATF, and even the Secret Service, which have all played roles in maintaining a false narrative about January 6.</p>\n<p>Beattie’s work ties the pipe bomb incident directly to the narrative surrounding the Capitol riot. He insists that the pipe bombs were planted as part of a coordinated effort to escalate the situation and justify the government’s response. For Beattie, the ultimate goal is not just to uncover the truth but to hold those responsible accountable.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the whole Thursday WarRoom segment featuring Darren Beattie:</p>\n<h1>Darren Beattie Lays Out Case Of J6 Pipe Bomb: The FBI Stopped Their Investigation Because What They Found Was Incriminating To The Biden Regime</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h5>There is a rapidly escalating situation, South Korea is witnessing a political crisis that could have far-reaching implications for the region, as protests and political unrest intensify.</h5>\n<p>In a Saturday WarRoom conversation between Steve Bannon and retired Colonel John Mills, the two highlighted the dangerous convergence of internal political turmoil and external Chinese interference that threatens the stability of one of the U.S.’s most trusted allies in East Asia.</p>\n<p>President Yoon Suk-yeol is facing a political and social storm as thousands take to the streets in opposition to his government. Demonstrators have called for an end to martial law, but a significant portion of the protesters, according to Bannon and Mills, are reportedly Chinese nationals who have been flown in to incite further unrest. “One-third to two-thirds of these protests are Chinese,” Mills claimed, raising alarms about China’s growing influence in South Korea’s internal affairs.</p>\n<p>The political landscape in South Korea has become increasingly divided. The left-wing Democratic Party, led by Lee Jae-myung, has mounted a significant challenge to President Yoon’s leadership, accusing him of authoritarianism. Lee, who was recently convicted of malfeasance, has been a vocal critic of U.S. military presence in South Korea, calling American forces an \"occupation force” and pushing for the removal of THAAD missile systems. His anti-U.S. stance aligns with China’s broader geopolitical goals, as Beijing seeks to expand its regional influence.</p>\n<p>In response to mounting political pressure, President Yoon declared martial law on December 3rd, 2023, a highly controversial move. However, as Bannon and Mills pointed out, Yoon’s decision was strategic. The martial law declaration allowed him to launch a raid on the National Election Commission, which, according to Yoon’s government, was necessary to investigate suspected Chinese interference in South Korea’s elections. While legally justified, this move has sparked widespread outrage and fear of authoritarianism, fueling the protests.</p>\n<p>South Korea’s political system is becoming increasingly polarized as the situation unfolds. Yoon’s government has been at odds with the Democratic Party, which controls the National Assembly. The conservative People Power Party, in support of Yoon, is facing fierce opposition from the left. Mills, a former U.S. military officer with deep knowledge of East Asian geopolitics, warned that South Korea is in the midst of a power struggle that could weaken its defense posture against China. \"This is a critical moment for South Korea,” Mills said. \"If this government falls, the entire U.S.-South Korea alliance could be destabilized.”</p>\n<p>The political crisis in South Korea is not only a domestic issue but also a matter of strategic importance for the United States. The U.S. military has had a presence in South Korea since the Korean War, with approximately 28,000 troops stationed in the country. South Korea plays a pivotal role in the U.S.’s strategy to counter China’s growing influence in the region. If the protests and political unrest result in the downfall of President Yoon, it could create a vacuum that China may seek to exploit to undermine the U.S.-South Korea alliance.</p>\n<p>Adding to the complexity of the situation is the broader regional context. As Mills noted, South Korea is also attempting to rebuild its strained relationship with Japan, a key partner in the U.S.-led effort to counter China. However, the political left in South Korea, led by figures like Lee Jae-myung, is fiercely anti-Japan, further complicating the situation. With tensions between China, Japan, and South Korea already high, the potential collapse of Yoon’s government could leave South Korea vulnerable to Chinese influence.</p>\n<p>Bannon and Mills also expressed concern over the influence of the media in shaping public perception of the crisis. The mainstream media in South Korea, they argued, is largely sympathetic to the left-wing narrative, which portrays the situation as a struggle against authoritarianism. This portrayal, according to Bannon and Mills, obscures the deeper geopolitical battle playing out behind the scenes, where China is actively working to weaken South Korea’s government and undermine its alliance with the United States.</p>\n<p>The situation in South Korea is rapidly evolving, and with it, the stakes for U.S. interests in East Asia. As the political crisis deepens, the U.S. and its allies must closely monitor the developments in South Korea and prepare for potential fallout that could reshape the region’s security dynamics. For now, the people of South Korea remain at the center of a high-stakes geopolitical struggle, one that could have profound consequences for the future of East Asian stability.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this Saturday segment:</p>\n<h1>Col.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Trump’s Support for Speaker Johnson: A Strategic Move</h4>\n<p>Steve Bannon’s comments on Friday morning WarRoom highlighted a pivotal moment in the political landscape with the incoming 119th Congress being seated: President Trump’s support for Speaker Mike Johnson. According to Bannon, this is no casual endorsement—it’s a calculated move that signals Trump’s commitment to reshaping America’s legislative priorities. For the WarRoom audience, understanding this alignment is critical to grasping the broader battle ahead.</p>\n<p>Trump’s involvement goes beyond symbolic support. Bannon suggests Trump might actively whip votes to back Speaker Johnson. Why? Because the stakes are too high. From budget battles to defending conservative principles, Johnson’s leadership represents a frontline defense against what many see as a post-constitutional crisis in the United States.</p>\n<p>Watch Friday’s opening segment of WarRoom for more context:</p>\n<h1>Steve Bannon Previews Speaker Race: \"What Is The Task And The Purpose Of The House”</h1>\n<h4>Johnson’s 1,500-Page Bill Bombshell: A Wake-Up Call</h4>\n<p>Speaker Johnson recently dropped a 1,500-page bill packed with hundreds of billions in spending. For the WarRoom faithful, this raises red flags. Bannon didn’t mince words about the challenges Johnson faces. He criticized the lack of spending offsets and the reliance on continuing resolutions (CRs) to fund the government—a tactic long despised by grassroots conservatives.</p>\n<p>Trump’s potential involvement in whipping support for Johnson suggests this isn’t just about one bill. It’s about setting the stage for a larger agenda. The WarRoom audience is urged to stay vigilant. They must question whether these moves truly serve America’s interests or fall into the same traps that have frustrated patriots for decades.</p>\n<h4>The Task and Purpose: Why This Matters</h4>\n<p>Bannon stressed a key question: What is the task and purpose of the House under Johnson’s leadership? For Trump supporters, this boils down to more than just legislation—it’s about saving a nation they believe is “radically off track.”</p>\n<p>Johnson’s role is pivotal. As Bannon pointed out, the Trump movement can’t afford unforced errors. Every decision, every vote, must align with the larger mission: restoring sovereignty to American citizens and upholding the constitutional republic. Trump’s hands-on approach signals that he sees Johnson as a critical ally in this effort.</p>\n<h4>WarRoom’s Call to Action: Use Your Agency</h4>\n<p>Bannon’s rallying cry to the WarRoom audience is clear: Get involved. He reminded listeners that grassroots activism has historically delivered stunning victories, such as Dave Brat’s unexpected primary win over Eric Cantor. That victory, fueled by a dedicated base, serves as a blueprint for what can be achieved with focused effort.</p>\n<p>For WarRoom followers, this means using their agency. Whether it’s reading up on legislation, making calls, or organizing locally, every action counts. The grassroots energy that propelled Trump in 2016 must now be channeled to understand the dynamics of the House and the broader conservative agenda.</p>\n<h4>Trump and Johnson: A Partnership to Watch</h4>\n<p>The partnership between Trump and Johnson represents a critical junction in America’s political battle. For WarRoom listeners, it’s a reminder of the importance of staying engaged and holding leaders accountable. Bannon’s message was clear: The fight is far from over, and every member of the movement has a role to play.</p>\n<p>The next few months will test the strength and resolve of the MAGA movement. Will Trump’s support for Johnson pave the way for meaningful change, or will it fall victim to the same pitfalls that have plagued Congress for years? For now, all eyes are on the Speaker—and the WarRoom is watching closely.</p>\n<p>This battleground report underscores the urgency of the moment. As Bannon said, the WarRoom audience must stay ready. The stakes couldn’t be higher.</p>\n<p>Watch the full Friday morning WarRoom for more:</p>\n</div>\n"

Media row, with its dynamic displays and steady activity, is the heartbeat of the event. At the center of it all is the Real America’s Voice studio booth, a hub of activity that consistently draws a crowd. Watching WarRoom broadcast live from this setup is nothing short of inspiring.</p>\n<p>Steve Bannon, always in his element, commands the space with precision and purpose. He bridges the gap between delivering critical information and motivating the Posse with a directness that’s unparalleled. The platform he’s built is far more than a news outlet; it’s a rallying point for patriots everywhere. Each live broadcast at AmFest reinforces how vital this connection is to the grassroots movement.</p>\n<p>No AmFest would be complete without Steve’s speeches. The convention center comes alive when he takes the stage, with no seat left empty. Every speech builds on the last, leaving the crowd more energized and focused. The thunderous applause and cheers are a reminder of the collective strength and determination of the Posse.</p>\n<p>Beyond the speeches and broadcasts, AmFest offers something equally valuable: the opportunity to connect. Meeting fellow Posse members—some for the first time, others from past events or online forums—is always a highlight. These moments of shared stories and experiences create bonds that strengthen our movement and our resolve.</p>\n<p>What stands out most every year are the stories. Some attendees seek direction on turning their passion into action, while others proudly share how their advocacy groups are making real changes in their communities.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h1>After-Action Report:  Understanding the True Meaning of “America First” in the Wake of President Trump’s Resounding Victory</h1>\n<p>The victory of President Donald J. Trump in 2024 marked a historic turning point in the nation’s political landscape. The America First agenda, which has defined Trump’s approach since his first campaign in 2016, continues to resonate powerfully with millions of Americans. This movement is grounded in the principle that the American people should come before all others, ensuring that the needs and rights of U.S. citizens are prioritized in every area of government policy.</p>\n<p>In a Friday conversation on WarRoom between Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec, a critical distinction was made that clarifies and reinforces the foundation of the America First movement. Bannon and Posobiec explained that while the idea of “America First” has been misinterpreted or manipulated by various political forces, its core meaning is simple and non-negotiable: American citizens are the priority. This is not a question of race, background, or heritage. It is a matter of legal and sworn citizenship.</p>\n<p><strong>Distinction Between Citizenship and Ethnic Background</strong></p>\n<p>Bannon and Posobiec underscored that what matters in the context of America First is not the individual’s ethnic background but their sworn allegiance as a citizen of the United States. This principle emphasizes that every person who is an American citizen, regardless of their origin, deserves to be treated with respect, fairness, and priority. The values and priorities of the America First movement are centered on ensuring that Americans, particularly those who have fought for the nation or contributed to its growth, are not displaced by foreign interests or cheap labor from overseas.</p>\n<p>Posobiec pointed out that the real fight of the America First agenda is to ensure that those who have “bones in the ground”—the people who have built and defended the country—are the ones who are given the opportunities and resources they deserve. In stark contrast, the globalist elites, including both CEOs and Marxists, often push for policies that serve only their own interests, like importing cheap labor or prioritizing global concerns over domestic prosperity.</p>\n<p><strong>The Need for Clarity on America First</strong></p>\n<p>The importance of understanding the true meaning of America First is crucial for the ongoing success of the movement. As Bannon stated, this is not about abstract numbers or spreadsheets. It is about the American people—the working class, the veterans, the everyday citizens who have carried the weight of this nation for generations. The 2024 election results have shown that this message resonates more than ever, as voters continue to reject globalist policies and embrace a vision of national pride, sovereignty, and respect for the American citizen.</p>\n<p>One of the key areas where this distinction plays out is in the immigration debate. The America First agenda does not advocate for shutting the door to those seeking a better life but does insist that America’s needs come first. Ensuring that U.S. citizens are provided with jobs, healthcare, and opportunities should always be the priority. Bannon and Posobiec made it clear that while America is a welcoming nation, the rights of American citizens cannot be compromised by the importation of cheap foreign labor. Policies that treat American workers as secondary are detrimental to the nation’s long-term prosperity.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: The Path Forward</strong></p>\n<p>The conversation between Bannon and Posobiec serves as a reminder that the America First movement is fundamentally about the people. The real power of the movement lies in ensuring that the American citizen, regardless of background, is prioritized in every aspect of national policy. President Trump’s victory in 2024 has reaffirmed this vision, signaling a continued commitment to putting America and its people first.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, all Americans must understand and embrace the true meaning of America First: a nation that puts its citizens—those who have earned their place as members of the republic—at the forefront of policy and governance.</p>\n<p>For more context watch:</p>\n<h1>Jack Posobiec And Steve Bannon: It Is American CITIZENS First</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h1>SIT-REP: The Golden Age of Trump, Steve Bannon Unleashes His Vision for America’s Future</h1>\n<h3>The Arc of History and the Golden Age of Trump</h3>\n<h5>On December 23, 2024, Steve Bannon kicked off his War Room broadcast with a powerful message about the \"Golden Age of Trump,” framing it as a pivotal moment in American history. \"This is the age of Trump,” Bannon said, emphasizing the shift in national politics and the movement’s trajectory. His speech, marked by high energy, reflected the intense devotion of his \"WarRoom Posse” — a group of supporters following his lead through this fight for the country’s future.</h5>\n<p>Bannon passionately spoke about the significance of this moment, highlighting how Trump’s vision is transforming America. The Golden Age is more than just a political comeback; it completely reshapes the country’s course. “We’re not just fighting for the next election; we’re fighting for the future of this nation,” he declared, emphasizing the personal stakes involved in this revolution.</p>\n<p>President Trump praised the WarRoom in his historic Sunday speech:</p>\n<h3>The 21 Million Deportations: A Game-Changer</h3>\n<p>A major point in Bannon’s commentary was Trump’s bold deportation claim. In his Sunday speech, Trump reportedly used the figure \"21 million” to describe the number of deportations he plans, starkly contrasting the typical estimates of around 12 to 15 million. \"I’ve reached out to the Trump team to double-check that number, and I think it’s monumental,” Bannon said. Regardless of the precise number, the message was clear: under a second Trump administration, the deportation effort would be on a scale never seen before. This number alone highlights Trump’s unyielding stance on border control and his commitment to reshaping America’s immigration policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Speech: </strong></p>\n<h3>What Motivates Trump? And What Fuels Bannon?</h3>\n<p>Bannon went on to reflect on what motivates both him and President Trump. For Bannon, it’s about ensuring that America doesn’t fall victim to the \"established order” that he believes has betrayed the country. “This fight isn’t just about Donald Trump; it’s about saving the country from a political class that doesn’t represent the people,” he said.</p>\n<p>For Trump, the motivation is even more personal. \"He has won 2020 in his soul,” Bannon revealed. This belief in a stolen election drives Trump’s unrelenting fight to reclaim power, and it’s a key reason why he’s so committed to the next phase of this political war. \"This is the linkage,” Bannon emphasized, clarifying that Trump’s belief in 2020’s illegitimacy is at the heart of his push for the Golden Age.</p>\n<h3>The Sunlit Uplands: Beyond the Deportations</h3>\n<p>Bannon also touched on the broader vision for America, referring to it as the \"Sunlit Uplands” — a time of prosperity and strength once the country fights its current chaos. He framed the deportations, wars, and political battles as part of a necessary process to get America back on track. \"We’re fighting against the radical left, the donor class, and political puppets,” Bannon said, underscoring the magnitude of the battle ahead.</p>\n<h3>A Movement Fueled by the People</h3>\n<p>Bannon wrapped up his remarks by reflecting on the incredible energy he’s witnessed firsthand from his supporters. He spoke about the thousands of people he met during recent events like AMPFest, where the energy was palpable. “The intensity is incredible,” he said, emphasizing how important it is for the War Room’s audience to stay focused and involved. Bannon sees his followers as crucial to the movement’s success, and he’s clearly invested in their engagement. \"You are the Vanguard, the Cadre — the tip of the spear,” he told them, calling on them to keep pushing forward.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: A Fight That’s Just Beginning</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s message on this December Monday was clear: the fight for America’s future is far from over. The Golden Age of Trump is just beginning; with it, the movement’s most complex challenges lie ahead. As Bannon said, \"We’re not backing down. We owe it to this country.” The stakes are high, and Trump and his followers are ready to continue the battle for the nation’s future.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the opening segment of Monday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>\"The Representation Of The Posse Was Incredible.” Steve Bannon Reflects On AmFest 2024</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>Situation Report, Christopher Wray Resigns:</h3>\n<h5>In a blistering Thursday commentary on the WarRoom, Steve Bannon reacted to footage aired on MSNBC discussing Christopher Wray’s resignation as FBI Director. The cold open included claims of internal FBI dissatisfaction, allegations of resistance within the agency, and Wray’s failure to stand firm amidst political and institutional turmoil. Bannon wasted no time dissecting Wray’s decision to step down, using charged language to underscore what he viewed as a cowardly capitulation.</h5>\n<p><strong>Resources for this report: </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/crossfire-hurricane-reckoning-mike-davis-and-steve-bannon-demand-justice-for-trumps-second-term/\">Crossfire Hurricane Reckoning: Mike Davis and Steve Bannon Demand Justice for Trump’s Second Term</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/bannons-solemn-pledge-to-heaven-comes-true-gop-exposes-pelosis-january-6th-failures-even-as-he-sits-behind-bars/\">Bannon’s Solemn Pledge to Heaven Comes True: GOP Exposes Pelosi’s January 6th Failures Even as He Sits Behind Bars</a></p></blockquote>\n<h3>Thursday’s Cold Open</h3>\n<p>The MSNBC segment painted a picture of a fractured FBI. The host suggested that some within the agency, including former FBI special agents, were unhappy with its direction. They reportedly supported major reforms and had ties to figures like Kash Patel and groups seeking to “bust up” the bureau. Wray, the segment implied, could have stayed to provide stability but chose to leave, thereby handing the reins to Trump’s incoming administration. The anchor lamented this decision, framing Wray’s resignation as a missed opportunity to safeguard continuity within the FBI.</p>\n<p>The segment ended with speculation about Trump’s intentions to reshape the FBI, possibly through figures like Patel, who critics fear could turn the bureau into a “department of revenge and retribution.”</p>\n<h3>Bannon’s Take</h3>\n<p>Bannon began his response by casting Wray’s resignation as an act of surrender. \"He didn’t just leave,” Bannon said. \"He waved the white flag. Hands up, no fight, no resistance. Total capitulation.” To Bannon, this act symbolized a broader failure within the establishment to stand up against the forces of reform and accountability represented by Trump and his allies.</p>\n<p>Bannon contrasted Wray’s resignation with what he sees as the unyielding fearlessness of Trump’s inner circle. \"President Trump, he never shows fear. Kash Patel, Peter Navarro, Boris Epshteyn—these are fighters. They’ve been through it all, from diesel therapy to public smears, and they’re still standing. That’s how you win. You don’t back down. You don’t quit.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A Failure to Hold the Line</h3>\n<p>Bannon lambasted Wray for not staying to “stand in the breach.” According to him, Wray had a unique opportunity to act as a buffer against chaos but instead chose personal preservation. \"If Wray had any backbone, he would have stayed another six months. Just long enough to hold the line while the new administration sorted itself out. Instead, he chose to walk away, leaving the FBI leaderless and vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Bannon argued that Wray’s departure not only weakened the FBI but also emboldened Trump’s movement. \"They needed him to stay,” he said, referring to establishment figures who hoped Wray could mitigate the impact of incoming reforms. \"Without him, it’s game over. They’re scrambling now, panicked. And guess what? Trump is coming, and he’s bringing the reckoning with him.”</p>\n<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s commentary framed Wray’s resignation as part of a larger narrative about the collapse of establishment resistance to Trump’s agenda. He linked the resignation to broader themes of war, debt, and immigration, painting a dire picture of converging crises that require bold leadership. \"Wray’s exit isn’t just about the FBI. It’s about the failure of these so-called leaders to confront the real issues: a global war, economic collapse, and an invasion at the border. They’re too busy protecting their own skins to fight for the country.”</p>\n<p>In closing, Bannon made it clear that he sees Wray’s resignation as a defining moment. \"This is what surrender looks like,” he said. \"Hands up. White flag. And the MAGA movement? We’re just getting started.”</p>\n<p><strong>For more context watch this Thursday’s footage: </strong></p>\n<h1>“Wray Capitulated To Us”: Bannon On Christopher Wray’s Resignation And Incoming Bombshell Report</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h5>Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly tore into the Biden administration on Friday’s WarRoom, accusing it of orchestrating legal overreach to protect its own officials while targeting its political opponents. Together, Bannon and Kelly spotlighted key players in the Democrat Biden administration and smashed the legal system, claiming their combined actions threatened American democracy.</h5>\n<h3>Bannon Dares Biden to Issue Pardons</h3>\n<p>Bannon wasted no time, opening the conversation with a bold challenge to the Biden administration. He dared the regime to issue blanket pardons for those involved in the politically charged investigations against former President Donald Trump. \"We dare you. Try it. Do it. We want to bury these criminals. We want to bury the Democratic Party,” he said, referring to individuals involved in what he called a “criminal” network.</p>\n<p>Bannon continued along his line of attack, saying that issuing pardons for these figures would only expose the administration’s corruption and fuel the populist backlash. \"They’ve terrorized this country. We dare you to give them blanket pardons,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Julie Kelly Names Names: Prosecutors and Their Alleged Crimes</h3>\n<p>Julie Kelly brought even more heat to the discussion, revealing names of individuals who she claims have been part of this alleged conspiracy to target Trump and his allies. She started by naming Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing the Mar-a-Lago document case. Kelly accused Smith of manipulating the legal process to benefit the Biden administration. \"The whole investigation into the so-called classified documents case was conducted in Washington, DC, even though the alleged crime happened in Florida,” Kelly pointed out. She argued that this move was strategic, as Washington judges are more likely to support the case than those in Florida.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Instead of conducting the investigation in the proper jurisdiction, they did it in Washington, DC,” Kelly continued. \"They knew they couldn’t get a rubber-stamp approval in Florida.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon joined in, criticizing other prosecutors on Smith’s team, including J. Brad, David Harbach, and James Pierce. He asked, \"What’s your beef with Jack Smith and J. Brad?” implying these prosecutors were part of a larger political scheme designed to harm Trump. The discussion quickly became focused on what Kelly believes are their real motives: to protect the Biden administration.</p>\n<h3>Accusations of Legal and Political Manipulation</h3>\n<p>Kelly accused the Biden administration of using the legal system as a political weapon to protect itself from scrutiny. One of her most significant revelations was the involvement of Biden’s legal team in the investigations. \"There’s proof that Jack Smith was taking marching orders from the Biden White House,” she revealed. She cited meetings between Biden’s legal counsel and Smith’s team, pointing to a clear chain of communication that allegedly links the president’s office to these high-profile legal proceedings.</p>\n<p>Bannon and Kelly also criticized the ongoing January 6th investigations, accusing the administration of keeping the \"jack boots” on the ground to arrest people connected to the event. Bannon warned that these actions would continue unless stopped, painting a grim picture of what he described as a regime that won’t back down until it has destroyed its opposition.</p>\n<h3>The Rogue’s Gallery: Who Are the Real Criminals?</h3>\n<p>The conversation took a darker turn as Kelly and Bannon named more figures involved in this web of alleged corruption. Kelly noted the potential risks of preemptive pardons, likening it to the Hunter Biden pardon, which she sees as a way to shield Joe Biden from legal fallout. \"A blanket pardon for Jack Smith and his team would be just like the Hunter Biden pardon,” she warned.</p>\n<p>Bannon also highlighted some of the other key figures he believes are behind these legal actions. \"You’ve got Fauci and his lies about Wuhan, you’ve got Liz Cheney, and now you’ve got Jack Smith and his team,” he said. These individuals, according to Bannon and Kelly, have played central roles in perpetuating a narrative of political persecution and legal overreach.</p>\n<h3>What’s Next: A Call for Justice</h3>\n<p>Both Bannon and Kelly concluded the conversation with a call for action. Bannon’s message was clear: the Biden administration must be held accountable for what they see as a corrupt, lawless operation. \"They’re not going to stop until you stop it,” Bannon warned, urging the public to stay vigilant.</p>\n<p>Kelly echoed Bannon’s sentiments, emphasizing that the only way to expose the corruption was through investigative journalism and legal challenges. \"It’s up to us to uncover the truth,” she said, implying that the fight against this alleged injustice was far from over.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: A Battle for Democracy</h3>\n<p>The conversation between Bannon and Kelly paints a picture of a political and legal system where power is misused and the truth is buried. By naming the individuals allegedly behind this corruption and highlighting their actions, they hope to spark a wider conversation about accountability and the state of American democracy. As the WarRoom segment concluded, the message was clear: the battle is far from over, and justice will only be served if the American people stand up and demand it.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this segment from Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Julie Kelly Demands Investigation Into Jan. 6 Federal Judges</h1>\n</div>\n"

Dubbed the \"Patriotism Czar,” Crowley’s appointment as Chief of Protocol and Assistant Secretary of State highlights her extensive experience and deep dedication to America.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Is the Role of Chief of Protocol?</strong></h3>\n<p>Crowley’s responsibilities as Chief of Protocol go far beyond ceremonial duties. She will oversee critical diplomatic engagements, ensuring seamless interactions between the President, Vice President, and international leaders.</p>\n<p>\"When heads of state land at Andrews Air Force Base, the first person they’ll see is me,” Crowley explained enthusiastically. She added, \"There’s no greater responsibility than representing the United States of America to the world.”</p>\n<p>Crowley will brief President Trump and Vice President Vance on global protocols and accompany them on all international trips aboard Air Force One.</p>\n<h3><strong>Managing Historic Events</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to diplomatic duties, Crowley has been tasked with leading preparations for major upcoming events. These include America’s 250th birthday in 2026, the World Cup final in New York/New Jersey, and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>\"President Trump has entrusted me with an incredible portfolio,” Crowley said, noting the significance of these global milestones. She described her role as ensuring that the United States shines on the world stage.</p>\n<h3><strong>From Treasury Official to Patriotism Czar</strong></h3>\n<p>Crowley previously served as a senior official at the U.S. Treasury Department during Trump’s first term. There, she helped deliver what she calls a \"blue-collar boom” through economic policies that benefited all Americans.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on her time at Treasury, Crowley said, \"I’m extremely proud of the work we did to create a rising economy for every single American.” She also highlighted her involvement in enforcing sanctions, stating, \"We targeted bad actors effectively and made a real impact.”</p>\n<p>Crowley credited her academic background—a PhD in international relations from Columbia University—and her work at Treasury for preparing her for this new challenge.</p>\n<h3><strong>\"Patriotism Czar”: A Fitting Title</strong></h3>\n<p>The title \"Patriotism Czar” was suggested by a colleague, and Crowley fully embraced it. \"I absolutely love that,” she said. \"It perfectly captures the spirit of this role. Representing the country I love is a true labor of love.”</p>\n<p>Steve Bannon praised Crowley for her qualifications, calling her \"a superstar” and \"an incredible person.” He added, \"President Trump picked well.”</p>\n<h3><strong>A Lifelong Dedication to America</strong></h3>\n<p>Crowley emphasized her deep love for the United States. \"This country is my heart and soul,” she said. \"I’ve dedicated my entire adult life to saving and supporting it.”</p>\n<p>She also shared a lighthearted moment about her mother’s reaction to her new role. \"My mom said, ‘Finally, you’re putting that Ivy League PhD to use!’” Crowley laughed.</p>\n<h3><strong>Still Connecting with the War Room Posse</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite her new responsibilities, Crowley remains committed to her audience.

Once confirmed, she’ll step into a role of immense responsibility, representing America on the world stage and shaping key international moments.</p>\n<p>\"This job is a huge thrill,” Crowley said. \"I’m honored and humbled to have the chance to serve my country again.”</p>\n<p>With her passion, experience, and commitment, Crowley is ready to embrace the challenge.

Drawing from the events in France, Bannon ties the crisis to <span>Thomas Piketty’s <em>Capital themes</em></span>, offering a stark warning for the United States.</h5>\n<p><strong>Resources for this report: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.everand.com/book/443189393/Capital-in-the-Twenty-First-Century?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_campaign=Everand_Bing_Search_Beta_NB_US&amp;utm_adgroup=Dynamic&amp;utm_term=everand&amp;utm_matchtype=b&amp;utm_device=c&amp;utm_network=o&amp;msclkid=01cbc4befa231d1ba1c0a3ef2579f938&amp;utm_content=Dynamic\">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.birchgold.com/bannon-dollar-empire/\">Steve Bannon: End of the Dollar Empire series (Free eBooks) Exclusive Reports on De-Dollarization from Stephen K. Bannon</a></strong></p>\n<h3>“Yesterday, The French Government Collapsed”</h3>\n<p>Bannon opened the discussion by highlighting the no-confidence vote that ousted France’s Prime Minister. He pointed out the rare unity between the far-right and left in this move.\n\"Here’s the lesson, boys and girls,” Bannon said. \"The French far-right and left unite in vote to oust the Prime Minister. Why? It’s simple. The system is unsustainable.”</p>\n<p>Bannon described the French situation as emblematic of a larger global problem: mounting deficits and unsustainable economic models. He compared France’s predicament to the challenges the U.S. faces with massive spending and slow economic growth.</p>\n<h3>The Economic Crisis: A Piketty Connection</h3>\n<p>Bannon linked the collapse in France to Piketty’s analysis in <em>Capital</em>, a book he described as “dense but essential reading.” He highlighted the irony of Piketty’s ideas, rooted in French economic thought, influencing policies that contributed to the government’s fall.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t it ironic,” Bannon remarked, “that Piketty’s own country suffers from the very policies he championed? It’s a warning for us here in the U.S.”</p>\n<p>He noted that France’s reliance on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)—the idea that governments can finance deficits by printing money without immediate consequences—was a major factor.</p>\n<h3>The Dangers of Modern Monetary Theory</h3>\n<p>Bannon argued that MMT, while tempting, has significant pitfalls. He explained that excessive deficit spending under MMT erodes investor confidence, leading to financial instability. \"France shows us the limitations of this approach,” Bannon said. \"Debt might not matter to governments, but it does to investors. And they’re speaking loud and clear.”</p>\n<p>He warned that the U.S. could face similar issues if leaders continue down this path. \"We’re adding a trillion dollars in debt every 100 days,” Bannon said. \"The model’s unsustainable. Without serious reforms, we’ll find ourselves in a situation like France’s.”</p>\n<h3>A Call to Action for the U.S.</h3>\n<p>Bannon emphasized the need for the U.S. to learn from France’s mistakes. He proposed focusing on reducing deficits, reforming tax policies, and controlling spending. \"We need to act before it’s too late,” he said.</p>\n<p>Patrick echoed these sentiments, urging Americans to educate themselves on economic issues. He praised Bannon’s efforts to raise awareness, saying, \"This is about empowering people to understand the stakes.”</p>\n<h3>Why <em>Capital</em> Still Matters</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s reference to <em>Capital</em> wasn’t just a critique. He acknowledged its importance in understanding wealth inequality and economic dynamics. \"It’s dense, sure, but it’s essential reading,” Bannon said. \"If we’re going to fix these issues, we need to understand how we got here.”</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: A Warning and a Path Forward</h3>\n<p>Bannon and Patrick used the French crisis as a cautionary tale for the U.S., blending economic theory with real-world events. Their message was clear: without reforms, the U.S. risks a similar collapse. As Bannon put it, \"The time to act is now, or we’ll be the next headline.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>A basic summary of the book: </strong></div>\n<div><em>Capital</em> by Thomas Piketty is an influential book on economics that examines wealth inequality and the dynamics of capital accumulation over time. Officially titled <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>, the book delves into how wealth has been distributed historically, the forces driving economic inequality, and the implications for modern economies.</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Key Themes and Ideas:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Historical Analysis of Inequality</strong>\nPiketty uses historical data, spanning centuries and multiple countries, to track income and wealth distribution trends. He argues that the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few is not an anomaly but a recurring pattern in capitalist economies.</li>\n<li><strong>The Role of Capital and Inheritance</strong>\nA central thesis is the formula <span><span>r&gt;gr &gt; g</span><span><span><span>r</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>g</span></span></span></span>, where <em>r</em> (the rate of return on capital) typically exceeds <em>g</em> (the rate of economic growth). When this happens, wealth grows faster than income, leading to increased inequality. Piketty highlights how inherited wealth often plays a more significant role than earned income in perpetuating economic divides.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Inequality and Its Consequences</strong>\nThe book outlines how extreme inequality can undermine democratic values and social stability. Piketty explores the social and political risks of wealth concentration, such as reduced economic mobility and the erosion of meritocracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nTo counter rising inequality, Piketty suggests policy measures like progressive taxation on income and wealth, as well as global coordination to implement taxes on capital, particularly on large fortunes.</li>\n<li><strong>Comparison to Karl Marx’s <em>Capital</em></strong>\nWhile the title nods to Karl Marx’s <em>Capital</em>, Piketty’s approach is different. He relies on empirical data rather than Marx’s theoretical framework, and his focus is more on wealth inequality than on class struggle or the labor-capital relationship.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Reception and Impact:</h3>\n<p>The book, published in 2013 (originally in French), became a global sensation. It sparked widespread debate about economic inequality and the role of government in addressing it. Critics praised Piketty’s rigorous analysis and accessible writing, though some economists have questioned his conclusions or the feasibility of his policy recommendations.</p>\n<p>In essence, <em>Capital</em> challenges readers to reconsider the nature of wealth accumulation, inequality, and the policies needed to create a fairer economic system in the 21st century.</p>\n<p><strong>For more context on the Thursday discussion between Pattrick and Bannon, watch this segment: </strong></p>\n<h1>Phillip Patrick: The U.S. Top Priority Should Be Getting Spending Under Control</h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

He added, \"We’ve had strategies since ‘99. Enough is enough.”</p>\n<p>Watch:</p>\n<h3>Bannon Celebrates Media Shift</h3>\n<p>On Wednesday ,host  Steve Bannon seized on O’Leary’s remarks during <em>WarRoom</em>, declaring a \"major sea change” in public discourse. \"For the first time since 2015, it wasn’t just unchained hatred. It was sophisticated policy discussion,” Bannon noted, highlighting a rare focus on tariffs, trade, and economics across mainstream outlets like MSNBC and CNN.</p>\n<h3>Tariffs as a Blunt Tool</h3>\n<p>Recalling Trump-era tariffs, Bannon emphasized their impact: \"When President Trump said, ‘I’ve had it with fentanyl and 70,000 deaths,’ Mexico and China got the message. Tariffs are a blunt tool, but they work.”</p>\n<h3>High-Stakes Economic Warfare</h3>\n<p>Bannon hailed O’Leary’s bold stance as a call to action. \"Kevin O’Leary gets it. Put 25% tariffs on the CCP now, and you’ll break their economy,” he urged. According to Bannon, such measures would boost wages for American workers while pressuring China’s regime.</p>\n<h3>The Moral High Ground</h3>\n<p>Declaring victory in the battle of ideas, Bannon said, \"We own the moral high ground. This is about bringing back jobs and defending our citizens. They’re just stooges for corporate oligarchs.”</p>\n<p>As Bannon frames it, the fight against the CCP is economic and moral, signaling a pivotal shift in U.S. policy and public opinion. “DEFCON ONE starts now,” he declared.</p>\n<h3>Expanding Economic Patriotism: A Movement Gains Momentum</h3>\n<p>Bannon doubled down on the necessity of economic nationalism, stressing that tariffs are only the beginning. “This isn’t just about balancing trade deficits,” he said. “It’s about dismantling a system that prioritizes corporate profits over American livelihoods.” Bannon’s vision ties into broader efforts to revitalize domestic manufacturing and rebuild working-class communities.</p>\n<p>He also highlighted the role of accountability in this economic war. “China’s economy is teetering because of their overreliance on exploitative practices. A trillion dollars injected into local economies won’t solve their problems if the global tide shifts against them.” Bannon’s strategy mirrors the boldness of Trump-era policies that leveraged economic tools to reassert America’s dominance.</p>\n<h3>Global Implications: Allies and Adversaries React</h3>\n<p>The tariffs debate isn’t limited to the U.S.-China axis. Bannon emphasized the need for cooperation with Mexico and Canada, particularly under the USMCA. “Trump showed what’s possible with pressure and negotiation. We need to replicate that success.” He also warned against appeasement strategies by European allies, arguing that a unified Western front is essential to counter China’s influence.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This is the new 1932 moment,” he said, referencing the Great Depression’s impact on global economic realignments. “It’s not just policy—it’s survival.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For more of our coverage on Trump tariffs:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/bannons-warroom-breaks-down-trump-tariffs-and-the-fight-for-american-prosperity/\">Bannon’s WarRoom Breaks Down Trump Tariffs and the Fight for American Prosperity</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/reviving-hamiltons-real-legacy-how-trumps-vision-of-economic-prosperity-harks-back-to-americas-founding-principles/\">Reviving Hamilton’s Real Legacy: How Trump’s Vision of Economic Prosperity Harks Back to America’s Founding Principles</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more context, watch this Wednesday WarRoom segment:</strong></p>\n<h1>MUST-WATCH: Steve Bannon Highlights The Messages President Trump’s Tariffs Send To Foreign Nations</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>Key Issues at Play</h3>\n<p>In a critical exchange <span>on Monday’s WarRoom, Steve Bannon and <a href=\"https://x.com/Nigel_Farage\">Nigel Farage</a> addressed two major global concerns—</span>rising tensions in Ukraine and a potential loss of one of America’s most important military assets, Diego Garcia. Farage and Bannon discussed how these developments are not just distant issues but could drastically impact American security and international power dynamics. Here’s why Americans should pay attention and what Farage is asking for.</p>\n<p>Resources for this Situation Report:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUTT7cfuCAQ&amp;t=2s\">Video- Diego Garcia: The Strategic U.S Military Base in Indian Ocean</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reformparty.uk/\">Reform Party UK- Nigel Farage</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/nigel-farage-calls-for-action-bannon-pledges-support-in-fight-against-banking-elites/\">Nigel Farage Calls for Action: Bannon Pledges Support in Fight Against Banking Elites</a></p>\n<h3>Bannon’s Warnings on Ukraine Escalation</h3>\n<p>Bannon sounded the alarm on the dangerously escalating conflict in Ukraine. With only 56 days left before the Trump administration takes office, Bannon expressed deep concern over the current state of affairs. He believes the recent actions by global leaders—especially those supporting further military escalation—are pushing the world to the brink of a catastrophic conflict. The situation, according to Bannon, is now more perilous than any time since World War II. His message? The geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, fueled by the Biden administration’s actions, could have disastrous consequences.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s frustration is evident. He sees political leaders using the situation to undermine Donald Trump’s potential peace-making efforts, driven by spite rather than rational governance. Bannon warns that this could make the world even more dangerous. His call to action is clear: the U.S. needs to shift its approach and focus on de-escalation before it’s too late.</p>\n<h3>Farage Exposes the Risk to Diego Garcia</h3>\n<p>Nigel Farage highlighted another urgent issue: the potential surrender of Diego Garcia to Mauritius. Diego Garcia, located in the Indian Ocean, is one of America’s most strategically important military assets. It is used as a vital U.S. base for operations across the globe. However, Farage revealed that the British government is working to cede control of the island to Mauritius, a move he deems driven by \"postcolonial guilt.”</p>\n<p>Farage argues that this decision would weaken American influence in the region at a time when China is rapidly expanding its global reach. Giving up Diego Garcia could result in China gaining more control over the area, further challenging U.S. military dominance and global security. Farage is furious about this potential betrayal of American interests and is asking U.S. leaders to take immediate action.</p>\n<h3>A Call for American Intervention</h3>\n<p>Farage’s warning isn’t just about a distant military base; it’s about the broader implications for global stability and U.S. security. He is asking for the incoming Trump administration to take action and make its opposition clear. Farage wants American voices—especially from powerful figures like Senator Marco Rubio—to speak out loud and clear against the UK’s plans. He believes that without a strong stance from the U.S., the British government might rush this decision, finalizing the deal before Trump takes office.</p>\n<p>\"This is not just a British problem; this is an American problem,” Farage emphasized. \"If we don’t stop this, the U.S. will lose a vital strategic asset, and the world will be a more dangerous place.”</p>\n<h3>The Consequences of Inaction</h3>\n<p>Farage and Bannon’s conversation paints a troubling picture of a world where geopolitical tensions are left unchecked. If the U.S. doesn’t prevent these shifts, America’s ability to influence global events and maintain strategic dominance could be significantly undermined. Farage fears that without immediate action, America’s position on the world stage will weaken, and global security will suffer.</p>\n<h3>What Americans Can Do Now</h3>\n<p>The time to act is now. Farage is urging Americans to join him in calling for a halt to the plans for Diego Garcia. He stresses that it’s not just about protecting a military base—it’s about safeguarding U.S. interests and ensuring a balanced global power structure. He’s asking for American voices to rise and push back against these dangerous moves before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>For those who want to stay informed, Farage directs people to his website, where they can follow updates on this developing story. The stakes are high, and the need for American involvement has never been greater, Farage told Bannon.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: Why This Matters for Americans</h3>\n<p>The exchange between Bannon and Farage serves as a wake-up call for the United States. The potential loss of Diego Garcia and the escalating situation in Ukraine are not just distant problems—they are ones that will shape America’s future security and influence. Farage is asking for urgent support from American leaders to prevent these risks from materializing. For the sake of global stability and American power, now is the time for action. The question remains: Will U.S. leaders take a stand before it’s too late?</p>\n<p>For more context on this conversation between Bannon and Farage watch this segment from Monday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Nigel Farage Warns The Globalists’ Escalation Has Placed Globe At Most Dangerous Levels Since 1945</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>A Vision for Change</h3>\n<h4>Washington, D.C., must return to its roots—a government of, by, and for the people—accountable, balanced, and transparent. Steve Bannon and constitutional advocates like Mark Paoletta from <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/\">the Center for Renewing America</a> are pushing for this with bold ideas to restore checks and balances- on Thursday’s WarRoom.</h4>\n<p>Resources for this report understand the Constitutional Power of Impoundment:</p>\n<h3>Restoring Checks and Balances</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s message is clear: \"The Constitution gives us the framework; we just need to enforce it.” On Thrusday while talking to Paoletta, he emphasized the importance of checks and balances, explaining how current systems fail. Congress is too often a bystander, allowing unchecked power in the executive branch.</p>\n<p>The solution? Congress must reclaim its role. Bannon underscored, “It’s about accountability. No one person or office should dominate. That’s what our Founders intended.”</p>\n<h3>Impoundment: The Forgotten Power</h3>\n<p>What is impoundment? It’s a president’s ability to refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. Bannon and constitutional voices believe it’s a key to stopping wasteful government overreach.</p>\n<p>Critics call it extreme, but advocates like Bannon disagree. \"Impoundment is not radical,” he explained. \"It’s a tool to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly.”</p>\n<p>Impoundment, a term that once held significant weight in American governance, has resurfaced in recent discussions about restoring balance between the executive and legislative branches.  Bannon, along with Mark Paoletta other constitutional advocates, has argued strongly for the reassertion of <strong>impoundment</strong> powers. Impoundment allows the President to refuse to spend funds that Congress has allocated, essentially putting a check on potentially wasteful or unnecessary government expenditures.</p>\n<p>In their discussion Thursday in the WarRoom, Bannon stressed that this power is rooted in the Constitution, which empowers Congress to control the purse. However, over time, presidents have largely bypassed this tool, choosing to work within a system where they don’t have to confront Congress on spending decisions. Bannon pointed out, \"The Founders intended for checks on the executive, and impoundment is one of the most powerful tools Congress has—yet it’s rarely used.” He emphasized that this power isn’t about overreach; instead, it’s a measure of fiscal responsibility and control.</p>\n<p>The need for impoundment is especially critical today, as government spending has soared to unsustainable levels. Bannon and others believe that by reintroducing impoundment, presidents would be forced to justify their spending more carefully. This, in turn, would encourage the executive branch to work more closely with Congress, ensuring that every dollar spent aligns with the people’s needs rather than executive preferences. Bannon argued, “Impoundment isn’t radical. It’s a tool to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly.”</p>\n<p>Critics of impoundment, however, argue that it could undermine Congressional authority, essentially giving the President unilateral power to withhold funds. But Bannon and his allies maintain that the executive must be accountable, and Congress must reclaim its responsibility to oversee government spending. The goal, as they see it, is to restore the checks and balances that keep the federal government in check and ensure it truly serves the people.</p>\n<p>Highlighting this, checks on reckless spending could dramatically limit executive overreach, returning financial power to Congress where it belongs.</p>\n<h3>Why This Matters</h3>\n<p>This approach isn’t just about saving money. It’s about restoring the balance of power. Without it, the people lose control over how their money is used.</p>\n<h3>The People’s Government</h3>\n<p>Washington DC doesn’t belong to the elites. It belongs to you. Let’s take it back.  The America First movement isn’t about partisanship. It’s about accountability. Returning D.C. to the people is a non-negotiable.</p>\n<h1>Mark Paoletta Previews The Incoming Fight President Trump Must Bear</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist and close ally of President Donald Trump, is facing serious charges in New York over his involvement in the “We Build the Wall” campaign. However, despite the weight of the allegations, Bannon remains defiant and unapologetic, vowing to continue his fight against what he describes as a politically motivated attack on his character and mission.</p>\n<p>One woman close to the story, who was involved with the project, posted on social media a statement in support of Bannon on Tuesday:</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Bannon appeared in a New York courtroom as Judge April Newbauer declined to delay his upcoming trial, which is set for December 9. Bannon is charged with defrauding supporters who donated to the online campaign aimed at funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Prosecutors claim that some of the $15 million raised was diverted for personal use by Bannon and the campaign’s president, Brian Kolfage.</p>\n<p>According to ABC News, while the defense team sought to delay the trial until January to address new evidence presented by the prosecution, the judge did not grant the request. However, Newbauer left open the possibility of adjusting the trial schedule after a hearing next Monday. The prosecution asserts that the evidence will not lengthen the trial, which is expected to last about a week.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s legal team, led by defense attorney John Carman, has pushed back strongly, arguing that they need more time to properly counter the new evidence. Carman also suggested that Bannon’s co-defendants in a related federal case could be called to testify in his defense, possibly shedding new light on the case.</p>\n<p>ABC News reported that for his part, Bannon has consistently denied the charges and maintains that the funds he received from the “We Build the Wall” campaign were for legitimate expenses. “The money that he was taking was money he was entitled to take,” Carman argued in court, emphasizing Bannon’s belief that he was reimbursed for his work in the campaign.</p>\n<p>Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, Bannon clarified that he sees this legal battle as part of a broader political struggle. As he walked from the courthouse, Bannon took a moment to address reporters and denounce what he called “lawfare” – the weaponization of the legal system for political gain. \"The people rendered their verdict on this lawfare last Tuesday,” he said, referring to the outcome of the recent election. \"The hunted are about to become the hunters.”</p>\n<p>Bannon’s comments highlighted his belief that the American people have already spoken out against the political establishment and its ongoing attacks on him and others aligned with the populist-nationalist movement. \"Working-class people, all over the country, came together and rejected what’s going on in this court,” he continued. \"The lawfare of Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Jack Smith, and Merrick Garland has been rejected by a landslide by the American people.”</p>\n<p>Bannon’s defiance is not new. He has faced significant legal challenges in recent years, including a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with a subpoena related to the January 6th Capitol attack. Despite these setbacks, Bannon remains steadfast in his commitment to the causes he champions, including the “America First” agenda and a fight against what he perceives as a corrupt political system.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s trial is set to be a pivotal moment in his ongoing battle with the legal system. While the outcome remains uncertain, it’s clear that Bannon intends to fight back with all the political capital and public support he can muster.</p>\n<p>For more context:</p>\n<h1>Steve Bannon Press Conference Nov 12, 2024</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>New Media vs. Old Guard</h3>\n<p>Steve Bannon and Benny Johnson launched a bold conversation on Monday’s WarRoom that is destined to resonate across the political landscape, with Bannon praising Johnson’s work as “changing the arc of history.” Their conversation exposes a new reality: conservative media figures like Johnson challenge legacy media, shaping public discourse in ways the traditional outlets can’t ignore. “This is not the same world for the broadcast networks,” Bannon argued, affirming the emerging power of independent voices that don’t hesitate to take on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are angry about this report, contact: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/general/contacting.htm\">US Senate</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Exposing the GOP’s Senate “Whip Count”</h3>\n<p>Benny Johnson’s latest report focuses on Senate leadership and the \"whip count,” revealing where senators’ loyalties lie. He highlighted how some GOP senators are supporting anti-Trump leaders like John Thune and John Cornyn behind closed doors, a move Johnson describes as a betrayal of MAGA principles. “This is a despicable insult to the American people,” Johnson declared, criticizing these senators for their lack of transparency. Johnson’s findings suggest that support for anti-Trump figures isn’t based on constituent interests but on maintaining Senate power structures.</p>\n<p>See Johnson’s post:</p>\n<h3>Secret Votes and Hidden Loyalties</h3>\n<p>One of the most shocking revelations was Johnson’s claim that GOP senators plan to vote for leaders like Thune and Cornyn in a \"dark of night” vote, hidden from public scrutiny. “Have you ever seen a U.S. senator shy away from the cameras?” Johnson asked, highlighting the absence of vocal support for these controversial candidates. According to Johnson, these senators avoid public endorsements for Thune or Cornyn because they fear backlash from their pro-Trump constituents. This secrecy, Bannon and Johnson agree, is a major red flag.</p>\n<h3>Betrayal of the MAGA Movement?</h3>\n<p>For Johnson and Bannon, supporting anti-Trump figures within the GOP represents a deep betrayal of the movement’s values. Many of these senators, Johnson noted, won their seats with Trump’s endorsement and the hard work of MAGA supporters. “This is an outright betrayal of MAGA,” Bannon affirmed, urging viewers to recognize the implications of senators siding with leaders who opposed Trump’s agenda. The fallout from these \"hidden votes” could impact the future of the GOP’s alignment with its base.</p>\n<h3>“The Real Mainstream Media”</h3>\n<p>Bannon claimed that voices like Johnson’s have become \"the real mainstream media,” taking the lead in driving political narratives once monopolized by billion-dollar media conglomerates. The rise of streaming, podcasts, and direct engagement has given figures like Bannon and Johnson unprecedented influence. Their core message: with each revelation, independent media is proving itself as a powerful alternative to conventional reporting.</p>\n<h3>A Call to Action: Demand Transparency</h3>\n<p>As a final call to action, Bannon urged his audience to contact their senators and demand transparency. He shared the U.S. Senate switchboard number, emphasizing the importance of a public vote on Senate leadership. For Johnson and Bannon, this is about accountability. If Senate Republicans want to move against Trump, Bannon argued, they should be willing to do it publicly, rather than hiding their votes.</p>\n<h3>Power of Independent Reporting</h3>\n<p>Johnson’s work highlights the growing strength of independent reporting in holding power to account. He noted that some senators, rather than embracing the new wave of conservative media, remain loyal to traditional media outlets like CNN, believing them to be the ultimate authority. Bannon, however, sees this as a miscalculation, noting that senators who align themselves with independent voices are \"beginning to see real power ascend to them.”</p>\n<h3>“No One Can Touch McConnell”?</h3>\n<p>Johnson’s investigation also exposed McConnell’s enduring influence over the Senate, which Johnson compared to a \"terrorist” stronghold within the GOP. Johnson insists that even McConnell, long seen as untouchable, is now vulnerable to the power of public scrutiny. “No one said we could touch Ronna, but look where she is now,” Bannon added, underscoring how public pressure has shifted GOP power dynamics in recent months.</p>\n<h3>The Road Ahead</h3>\n<p>As Bannon and Johnson wrapped up their explosive exchange, one message stood clear: independent media has the power to shift public opinion and hold political elites accountable. Bannon emphasized the importance of \"fighting an information war,” one in which transparency and truth are critical. Johnson vowed to continue his investigation, promising to bring the \"whip count” into the public eye—no matter the obstacles.</p>\n<p>In an era where traditional and new media are locked in a battle for influence, Bannon and Johnson’s conversation underscores a shift in who controls the narrative. With each report, Johnson and Bannon are redefining the boundaries of political accountability, leveraging independent media’s power to keep voters informed and engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources for this report:</strong></p>\n<p>Make Phone Calls and download this ap:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-importance-of-being-heard-warrooms-bill-blaster-empowers-citizens-to-make-an-impact/\">The Importance of Being Heard: WarRoom’s Bill Blaster Empowers Citizens to Make an Impact</a></p></blockquote>\n<h1>Benny Johnson Reveals Senators’ Loyalties For Senate Leadership Vote</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><em>Joshua Lyons is a U.S. Army veteran who served multiple deployments to the Middle East and Afghanistan, including with Abe Hamadeh in the same Battalion. He comes from a proud military family with three younger brothers who are also Army veterans. A former intelligence analyst with the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, Joshua holds a master’s degree from Abilene Christian University and a bachelor’s degree from Baylor University. Deeply committed to the pro-life movement, he actively works with the Dandy Project, supporting individuals and families dedicated to preserving life.</em></p>\n<p>This Veterans Day, we pause to honor the men and women who have worn the uniform, sacrificing far beyond the battlefield. Their commitment extends deeper than time served—they have given up irreplaceable years, moments that could have been spent building families, pursuing dreams, or creating futures. They forfeited not just time but the freedom to shape their own lives, all to safeguard a vision of a safe, prosperous America.</p>\n<p>The true cost of service is rarely acknowledged in full. For veterans, it’s not only the years overseas, the rigorous training, or time spent apart from loved ones; it’s the surrender of one’s youth—the chance to build careers, businesses, memories, and legacies. These men and women dedicate the best years of their lives, often returning to a world that has moved forward without them, carrying scars that endure long after their military contracts conclude.</p>\n<p>As a fellow veteran, I understand this difficult path. I’ve walked it myself, and I know the challenges that come with setting aside personal ambitions to serve something greater than oneself. I know the toll it takes on dreams, on family, and on the small but important moments of life. That’s why Abe Hamadeh’s sacrifice resonates deeply with me. Contrary to the distasteful comments from Blake Masters—whom Hamadeh handily defeated in the Republican primary for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District—suggesting that a candidate should have ‘skin in the game’ by having a wife and children, Abe’s commitment transcends traditional markers of success. He gave up years he could have spent nurturing a family or building wealth, choosing instead the path of a soldier, a defender, a guardian of freedom. Now, as he steps into public service, he brings that same spirit and devotion to his role in Congress, fighting not only for veterans but for the families and communities that make America great.</p>\n<p>Abe understands that family is the foundation upon which American freedoms are built. His sacrifices were made to protect those institutions from ideologies that threaten to dismantle them. His unwavering dedication to this country and its values serves as a beacon, showing us all that freedom is worth every sacrifice.</p>\n<p>And many veterans continue their service beyond the battlefield. Maureen Bannon, for example, once aspiring to a career in nursing, now finds herself on the front lines defending American values against threats here at home. Her father, Navy veteran Steve Bannon, sacrificed similarly, enduring imprisonment as a stark reminder that the fight for liberty remains as fierce on our soil as it is abroad. The Bannon family’s commitment to liberty exemplifies the readiness to bear any burden for the cause of freedom.</p>\n<p>As the Declaration of Independence asserts, \"We pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.” Abe, Maureen, and Steve have honored that pledge, sacrificing immensely to protect the values we hold dear. This Veterans Day, we owe our veterans more than our gratitude; we owe them our respect, our support, and the recognition that their sacrifices continue. Their battle will only truly conclude when threats to freedom are vanquished, and the next generation of veterans can build families, pursue dreams, and secure a future in the nation they so bravely defend.</p>\n</div>\n"

Bannon emphasizes the importance of grassroots involvement and staying updated through official channels.</h5>\n<h3>The Battle for the House</h3>\n<p>In a recent conversation, Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse focused on the looming uncertainty of House races. Bannon pointed out that the situation is almost like a \"poison chalice,” referring to the challenges the GOP faces under the leadership of figures like Speaker Jeffries and Rep. Jamie Raskin. He highlighted the ongoing nightmare of certifications and impeachments that have bogged down the House, but he remained hopeful about the GOP’s ability to hold onto power.</p>\n<h3>Current House Race Status</h3>\n<p>DeGrasse updated Bannon on the status of key races. In New York, three seats are still in play, but two of them are within the recount margin, which means the GOP could still win those. However, the Democrats have already claimed victory in two seats, with one still outstanding. The focus then shifted to California, where, according to local insiders, Republicans are optimistic about retaining their seats and possibly even gaining another one in Los Angeles.</p>\n<h3>Importance of Grassroots Efforts</h3>\n<p>DeGrasse urged Bannon’s followers to stay engaged. With recounts and ballot curing underway, DeGrasse encouraged people to get involved by becoming poll watchers or assisting with ballot counts. He suggested visiting local GOP offices for updates and volunteer opportunities, especially in Arizona, where the battle for Kari Lake’s seat continues to heat up.</p>\n<h3>Where to Stay Updated</h3>\n<p>For those looking to stay informed on the latest developments, DeGrasse recommended checking <a href=\"https://nrcc.org/\">NRCC.org</a> for real-time updates on House race projections. He also emphasized the importance of having a unified front in this critical moment, with Republicans looking to dominate not only the House but the Senate and White House as well.</p>\n<h3>Potential Gains for Republicans</h3>\n<p>Despite the ongoing battles, Bannon expressed confidence that Republicans could still pick up three to four additional seats, giving them more breathing room. He also reassured Bannon that races like Joe Kent’s seat look good, though counting had been paused temporarily.</p>\n<h3>The Bigger Picture: Full Spectrum Dominance</h3>\n<p>As Bannon and DeGrasse discussed the broader political landscape, Bannon framed the fight as part of a larger goal for \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-spectrum_dominance\">full spectrum dominance</a>.” He pointed out that Republicans now control the House, Senate, and White House, with the Supreme Court also on their side. This historic shift, Bannon noted, is the result of years of hard work and grassroots mobilization.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts: A Great Day for the Movement</h3>\n<p>DeGrasse ended the conversation by expressing his optimism for the future. He acknowledged the tough nature of the House races but stressed that the GOP is in a strong position. Bannon, too, shared his excitement, calling it a \"great day” for the movement—especially due to the dedication of those working tirelessly behind the scenes.</p>\n<h3>Stay Engaged: Social Media and Next Steps</h3>\n<p>For those looking to follow the action, DeGrasse encouraged viewers to follow him on social media platforms like <a href=\"https://x.com/Degrasse81\">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a href=\"https://gettr.com/user/degrasse\">Getter.</a> He emphasized that the hard work is far from over, but the momentum is clearly on the side of Republicans as they push forward in these pivotal races.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>The conversation between Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse highlighted the tension and determination within the GOP as they work to secure House races and potentially expand their majority. The call for continued grassroots involvement and staying updated through reliable channels like NRCC.org underscores the importance of unity in this critical phase of the election process. The stage is set for a historic shift in political power—one that could reshape the future of American governance.</p>\n<p><strong>For more of our coverage of DeGrasse: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/here-is-the-list-to-focus-on-alex-degrasses-crucial-must-win-house-seats-across-america/\">Here is the List to Focus on, Alex DeGrasse’s CRUCIAL MUST-WIN House Seats Across America</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more of our coverage on being heard in Washington DC: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-importance-of-being-heard-warrooms-bill-blaster-empowers-citizens-to-make-an-impact/\">The Importance of Being Heard: WarRoom’s Bill Blaster Empowers Citizens to Make an Impact</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more on the power of grassroots activism: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/trump-pa-allies-rally-the-troops-grassroots-need-to-do-heavy-lifting-to-secure-2024-victory-for-trump/\">Trump PA Allies Rally the Troops: Grassroots Need to do Heavy Lifting to Secure 2024 Victory for Trump</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more context on DeGrasse’s comments, watch: </strong></p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):</h3>\n<h5>Steve Bannon argued on Wednesday’s WarRoom program that corporate media fundamentally misunderstands and underreports Trump’s widespread support, blinding itself to a historic populist movement. Drawing on his admiration for historical figures, Bannon painted Trump as a pivotal leader challenging the establishment narrative as the media struggled to grasp the fundamental dynamics at play.</h5>\n<h3>Media’s Bubble: \"They Don’t Get It”</h3>\n<p>In Bannon’s view, the media exists in a bubble, isolated from the reality of Trump’s broad appeal. \"They still don’t get it,” he stated emphatically, criticizing corporate outlets for ignoring the everyday lives of Americans who feel left behind by traditional power structures. Bannon believes the media’s coverage doesn’t merely lack perspective—it actively misleads the public about Trump’s movement.</p>\n<p>According to Bannon, mainstream media, including even conservative outlets like Fox News, has sidestepped the \"America First” message. “Fox wouldn’t even show the rallies because they knew Trump was going to talk about election interference,” he pointed out. This, he argued, isn’t journalism but a calculated effort to stifle what he sees as an authentic political awakening among average Americans.</p>\n<h3>Trump’s Movement: A Grassroots Engine of Change</h3>\n<p>Bannon sees Trump’s followers as grassroots powerhouses, likening them to movements from America’s revolutionary past. “This is a<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrapping.asp#:~:text=The%20term%20bootstrapping%20refers%20to%20a%20situation%20in,or%20the%20operating%20revenues%20of%20the%20new%20company.\"> bootstrap</a> operation,” Bannon said, describing the thousands of volunteers and voters powering Trump’s campaign through door-to-door engagement and community activism. To him, these individuals, rather than the establishment’s carefully managed narratives, are the true lifeblood of this political shift.</p>\n<p>Bannon highlighted the establishment’s surprise over the support scale for Trump’s message. “The scale of it shocked them,” he added, pointing out how a robust volunteer base transforms the political landscape in key states. For Bannon, this is a testament to the movement’s resilience and the media’s miscalculation in overlooking its force.</p>\n<h3>The Historic Moment Media Ignored</h3>\n<p>In Bannon’s eyes, this is a historic moment akin to the political upheavals of past centuries. He compares Trump’s movement to the realignments of 1932, envisioning a future where this era will be studied as a defining period in American history. \"What you have accomplished,” Bannon said to Trump’s supporters, \"will be discussed in history classes 100 years from now.”</p>\n<p>Bannon argues that the corporate media, consumed by their conventional narratives, is entirely missing this transformative period. By downplaying or dismissing Trump’s support, he believes they’re \"on the wrong side of history.” In his words, this is not a fleeting trend but the start of a new populist revolution that will reshape the nation’s political fabric.</p>\n<h3>Trump Through the Lens of History: A Leader for the Ages</h3>\n<p>For Bannon, Trump’s leadership is far from ordinary; it carries historical weight. He often draws parallels between Trump and figures like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, framing Trump as a leader facing challenges as significant as those faced by the nation’s founders. \"No other men in the history of this Republic, save Washington and Lincoln, had the personal fate of the nation so closely tied to their own,” Bannon stated, underscoring the importance of Trump’s role.</p>\n<p>In Bannon’s view, Trump embodies the same defiant spirit of past revolutionary leaders, willing to confront entrenched power for the sake of the American people. This, he believes, is precisely what the media fails to grasp. To them, Trump is a divisive figure, but for Bannon, Trump represents an enduring legacy in the tradition of American leadership.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: Bannon’s Vision and Media’s Blind Spot</h3>\n<p>Ultimately, Bannon insists that the corporate media is missing one of this generation’s most significant political movements. \"They’re out of touch,” he claimed, asserting that the media’s bubble blinds it to the voices and concerns of the American people. With his historical framing, Bannon suggests that Trump’s movement is not merely another political campaign but part of a profound transformation.</p>\n<p>As Bannon calls the media to account, he leaves no doubt about his belief in the stakes of this moment. \"This isn’t just politics as usual,” he said. For Bannon, the story is about a nation in flux, a leader in Trump poised to reshape it, and a media apparatus that just can’t keep up.</p>\n<p><strong>For more of our coverage of Bannon’s teachings:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/why-it-matters-steve-bannons-firey-comparison-of-trump-to-cincinnatus-signals-a-call-for-revolutionary-leadership/\">Why It Matters: Steve Bannon’s Firey Comparison of Trump to Cincinnatus Signals a Call for Revolutionary Leadership</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/note-to-voters-red-tuesday-looms-still-steve-bannons-painful-warning-of-economic-destruction-under-democrats/\">Note to Voters, ‘Red Tuesday Looms’ Still: Steve Bannon’s Painful Warning of Economic Destruction Under Democrats</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/youre-cratering-democrats-bannons-defiant-warning-as-maga-rises-again/\">\"You’re Cratering, Democrats”: Bannon’s Defiant Warning as MAGA Rises Again</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/was-bannon-right-populist-war-on-wall-street-bannons-rant-echoes-as-market-bets-on-a-trump-victory/\">Was Bannon Right?

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>MAGA Eyes Victory in Key Battleground States</h3>\n<p>Steve Bannon, Jack Posobiec, and Sam Faddis joined War Room on Sunday’s mobilization Sunday special to discuss MAGA’s final push in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These battleground states are crucial for MAGA’s strategy, and the panel emphasized that victory depends on turnout and canvassing. “This is a historic realignment,” said Faddis. \"Trump’s going to win by several points.”</p>\n<h3>Trump Support Strong on the Ground in Pennsylvania</h3>\n<p>Posobiec reported from Pennsylvania, observing enthusiastic Trump support among young voters and college crowds. \"I wore a Kamala Harris hat at Penn State, and they booed me out of the bars,” he said, illustrating local resistance to the Democratic ticket. Posobiec also highlighted how major media downplays MAGA’s momentum, adding, \"The New York Times doesn’t want to focus on election integrity at all.”</p>\n<p>Posobiec referred to this video post:</p>\n<h3>Closing the \"Blue Wall” with Key Allies</h3>\n<p>Faddis urged MAGA supporters in Pennsylvania to “finish the job.” With the race tightening, he stressed the need for full-spectrum voter engagement, from friends to neighbors. “You see the finish line ahead,” Faddis said, “but you don’t slow down. You sprint.” He believes that if MAGA mobilizes enough, they’ll break through the blue wall, claiming, “Not only is Trump going to win, but by several points.”</p>\n<p>To mobilize this effort, Faddis noted the coordination between grassroots activists and prominent conservative figures like Elon Musk, Miriam Adelson, Chris Buskirk, Charlie Kirk, and Ralph Reed. \"You’ve got the precinct strategy guys, and later we’ll have Dan Schultz from Arizona, who’s done an amazing job building volunteer bases,” Bannon added.</p>\n<h3>Connecting with Pennsylvania’s Patriot Network</h3>\n<p>For those looking to stay engaged, Faddis pointed out resources for Pennsylvania activists:</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania Patriot Coalition: \"You can go to <a href=\"https://pennsylvaniapatriotcoalition.com/\">PennsylvaniaPatriotCoalition.com</a>,” he said.</p>\n<p>\"We’re also on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1103629663684531/\">Facebook</a> and Substack, where we put a lot of time into covering Pennsylvania-specific stories on election integrity and broader national issues that affect this election.”</p>\n<p>Online Magazine: The coalition’s Substack magazine explores critical topics, such as local election integrity efforts and concerns about Tim Walz’s connections to foreign influences.</p>\n<h3>Building Momentum for Election Day</h3>\n<p>Faddis emphasized the power of one-on-one outreach. “Don’t just talk to those who already agree with us,” Faddis said. \"Reach out to those undecided.”</p>\n<p>Posobiec encouraged people to put their MAGA hats on and go out to popular areas to encourage people to vote.</p>\n<p>The team encouraged canvassing and motivating voters right up to Election Day to ensure high turnout.</p>\n<h3>Final Message: \"Dominate the Field”</h3>\n<p>In closing, the panel highlighted the stakes, with Bannon noting, \"This is our country, and we’re taking it back.” MAGA supporters are being called to dominate the field through Tuesday, creating a \"full-spectrum MAGA dominance” to secure victory and counter what they see as \"media narratives designed to suppress their vote.”</p>\n<p>For more about the missing Democrat “Blue Wall”:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/hidden-trump-vote-giuliani-explains-the-undercurrent-of-support-behind-trump/\">Hidden Trump Vote: Giuliani Explains the Undercurrent of Support Behind Trump</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/voter-turnout-still-crucial-for-maga-but-wheres-the-dems-blue-wall/\">Voter Turnout Still Crucial for MAGA: But Where’s the Dem’s Blue Wall?</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch this panel discussion on Sunday’s WarRoom Mobilization special:</p>\n<h1>“You Can’t Leave The Ball On The Goal Line”: Posobiec Reminds MAGA To Not Stop Until Trump Wins</h1>\n<h1>“This Is Really A Historic Realignment”: Sam Faddis On MAGA’s Ideas Attracting Non-GOP Voters</h1>\n<h1>Jack Posobiec Highlights Election Day Efforts: “Keep Your Eyes On The Prize”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>Steve Bannon’s Fiery Rant: Reading the Tea Leaves</h3>\n<h5>Steve Bannon is never one to shy away from a strong opinion like why he believes that the 2020 election was stolen from President Trump with created ballots that never represented voters. On Saturday night, he delivered some bold comments that reflect his fervent belief in the future of the MAGA movement and as he looked back on what happened in the past. Bannon’s passion is palpable, revealing the bitter frustrations of those who oppose his  America First vision. Let’s dive into what he said and why it matters.</h5>\n<p>Critical Resource for this article:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/here-is-the-list-to-focus-on-alex-degrasses-crucial-must-win-house-seats-across-america/\">Here is the List to Focus on, Alex DeGrasse’s CRUCIAL MUST-WIN House Seats Across America</a></strong></p>\n<p>Reading list for Bannon’s Rant:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/why-it-matters-steve-bannons-firey-comparison-of-trump-to-cincinnatus-signals-a-call-for-revolutionary-leadership/\">Why It Matters: Steve Bannon’s Firey Comparison of Trump to Cincinnatus Signals a Call for Revolutionary Leadership</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/flashback-trumps-return-bannon-declares-it-greatest-comeback-in-history-amidst-establishment-resistance/\">FLASHBACK-Trump’s Return: Bannon Declares It ‘Greatest Comeback in History’ Amidst Establishment Resistance</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/join-the-revolution-mobilizing-the-warroom-community-for-huge-election-impact/\">Join the Revolution: Mobilizing the WarRoom Community for Huge Election Impact!</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/revolutionary-populism-steve-bannons-maga-battle-to-end-economic-inequality/\">Revolutionary Populism: Steve Bannon’s MAGA Battle to End Economic Inequality</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/countdown-to-270-trumps-50-state-strategy-from-matt-boyle-key-election-stats-you-need-to-know/\">Countdown to 270 : Trump’s 50-State Strategy From Matt Boyle, Key Election Stats You Need to Know</a></strong></p>\n<h3>\"We’re Not Going Anywhere”</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s message is clear: MAGA isn’t backing down. \"This movement is here to stay,” he declared with his trademark intensity, even after a 4-month prison sentence in Federal prison for a misdemeanor of defying Congress. He views the current political landscape as a battleground where the stakes couldn’t be higher. He believes that the American people are waking up to the realities of the political establishment’s failures and corruption, especially in the 2020 election when they claimed that Joe Biden got 81 million votes. \"The elites have failed us. They don’t care about working-class Americans,” he continued, underscoring his disdain for the political class.</p>\n<h3>Why the Opponents Are Frustrated</h3>\n<p>The frustration among Bannon’s opponents, like Bill Maher and others, is palpable. They see MAGA as a disruptive force. The traditional political structure is under siege, and they’re losing ground. For years, they’ve dismissed Bannon and his followers as a fringe movement. Yet, time and again, they’ve underestimated the resilience of MAGA supporters.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s opponents are frustrated because they can’t seem to shake off the narrative that resonates with so many Americans. \"The media tries to bury us, but they can’t. The truth is out there,” he asserts. This resilience fuels Bannon’s fire and makes him a compelling figure for those who feel left behind.</p>\n<h3>\"Reading the Tea Leaves”</h3>\n<p>Bannon also talked about \"reading the tea leaves.” This phrase encapsulates his strategic outlook on politics. He’s not just reacting to events; he’s predicting them, and talking about how Trump’s opponents will harass him after he wins. Bannon analyzes trends and sentiments that others overlook. \"I see a country that’s fed up,” he explained, illustrating his belief that a significant shift is on the horizon.</p>\n<h3>The Rise of Populism</h3>\n<p>What Bannon sees is a rise in populism. He believes that ordinary Americans are reclaiming their voices. The establishment has ignored their concerns for too long. \"They’ve written us off, but they’re in for a surprise,” Bannon exclaimed. This sentiment strikes a chord with his base, who feel disenfranchised and unrepresented.</p>\n<p>The MAGA movement is not just about Trump; it’s about a larger ideology. It’s about taking America back from the grips of an elitist agenda. Bannon’s fiery rhetoric serves as a rallying cry for supporters who feel emboldened by his words.</p>\n<h3>The Inevitability of Change</h3>\n<p>Bannon is confident about the inevitability of change. \"This is just the beginning. We’re on the verge of something big,” he said. His conviction that a populist revolution is brewing resonates with many who feel the tides of change are turning.</p>\n<h3>Why MAGA Stands Firm</h3>\n<p>The reason why MAGA stands firm in the face of opposition is simple: belief. Bannon’s supporters have a deep-seated belief in their cause. They are not swayed by the traditional metrics of political success. \"It’s not about winning every election. It’s about winning the hearts and minds of the people,” he stated.</p>\n<h3>The Future of the MAGA Movement</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s comments are not just fiery rants; they are a reflection of his deep-rooted ideology. He sees a bright future for MAGA, one where ordinary Americans reclaim their power. His critics, frustrated and bewildered, are struggling to comprehend this shift.</p>\n<p>In the end, Bannon’s passionate vision and strategic insights are resonating. He says, \"We’re in this for the long haul.” With that determination, it’s clear that Bannon and the MAGA movement are not going away anytime soon. The frustration among opponents is understandable; they are witnessing the rise of a force they cannot easily dismiss. Bannon is reading the tea leaves, and he sees a wave of change coming. Whether they like it, the MAGA movement is poised for a powerful resurgence.</p>\n<p>When people can openly investigate where the 81 Million Biden voters disappeared, there will be a lot to talk about.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch these segments:</p>\n<h1>Bannon: “If Those Voters Are Real, WHERE ARE THEY NOW!?”</h1>\n<h1>Bannon On The Importance Of The House: “Even If They’re In The Minority They Will Go After Trump”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h5>A shocking 1.2 million inactive voters remain on Arizona’s voter rolls, prompting serious concerns about election integrity.<a href=\"https://x.com/realAlexKolodin\"> Attorney Alexander Kolodin</a>, representing the advocacy group Citizen AG, is challenging state officials in court to ensure compliance with federal laws. His lawsuit aims to hold the Secretary of State accountable for failing to properly maintain voter lists. This case could have significant implications for upcoming elections in Arizona and beyond.</h5>\n<h3>The Alarming Discovery</h3>\n<p>In a recent discussion on the WarRoom with Steve Bannon, Kolodin revealed a startling truth: “Our public records request showed no proof that the Secretary of State has been removing ineligible voters from the rolls.” This revelation highlights a critical failure in the system designed to ensure fair elections. With 1.2 million individuals on the rolls, many of whom should no longer be eligible, the integrity of future elections is in jeopardy.</p>\n<h3>Why Are These Voters Still Listed?</h3>\n<p>Kolodin explained that several categories of voters should be regularly removed from the rolls. This includes individuals who have died, those adjudicated as insane, and those who have moved out of state. “The law requires that these voters be removed on an ongoing basis,” he noted. However, the response from Secretary of State Adrian Fontes was concerning. Kolodin received an answer that indicated a lack of documentation or action on this critical issue. \"I have no documents to show anything that I’ve been doing to take these folks off the rolls,” was the Secretary’s response, which only fueled Kolodin’s determination to pursue legal action.</p>\n<h3>The Lawsuit Explained</h3>\n<p>In light of the Secretary of State’s inadequate response, Citizen AG filed a lawsuit to demand accountability and transparency. Kolodin explained, “We had to go into court to request emergency relief that these documents be produced to our clients.” This legal move aims to ensure that voters who are unlawfully listed cannot cast their votes. Kolodin emphasized the importance of this case: \"With a major presidential election coming up, we want to check against our files and ensure nobody votes unlawfully.”</p>\n<h3>The Judge’s Response</h3>\n<p>Fortunately, the court took the matter seriously. Kolodin noted that the judge in this case actively questioned the Attorney General’s office about the Secretary of State’s failure to fulfill his responsibilities. \"The judge seemed to understand the gravity of the situation,” Kolodin said, signaling a potentially positive outcome for those advocating for election integrity.</p>\n<h3>Implications for Voter Integrity</h3>\n<p>The ramifications of this lawsuit extend far beyond Arizona. As Kolodin pointed out, \"In a state decided by margins of just 10,000 to 20,000 votes, 1.2 million inactive voters is a massive number.” If ineligible individuals are allowed to vote, the credibility of the entire electoral process could be compromised. With such high stakes, it’s crucial that citizens pay attention.</p>\n<h3>What Citizens Should Know</h3>\n<p>Voter roll maintenance is not just an administrative task; it’s a cornerstone of democracy. Kolodin stressed, \"We need to ensure that the voter rolls reflect the true, living population.” Citizens are urged to stay informed about this lawsuit and engage in discussions about election integrity. Following the developments can empower voters and foster accountability in the electoral process.</p>\n<h3>Why You Should Follow This Case</h3>\n<p>Kolodin’s fight is not just about numbers; it’s about preserving the integrity of elections for every citizen. \"Knowing the truth empowers voters,” he said. As this case unfolds, it could set important precedents for how voter rolls are managed across the country. Keeping track of this lawsuit is essential for anyone concerned about fair and transparent elections.</p>\n<h3>How to Stay Updated</h3>\n<p>To follow the latest developments in this case, citizens can check out <a href=\"https://x.com/_CitizenAG\">Citizen AG on Twitter,</a> where they provide regular updates. Kolodin also encourages people to reach out and stay engaged: \"We all have a role to play in ensuring our elections are fair.”</p>\n<p>For more context watch this Election Special segment:</p>\n<h1>Alexander Kolodin Gives Updates On The Release Of Voter Records By AZ Judge</h1>\n</div>\n"

According to Crane, there’s an urgent need for voters to know about these issues and hold government agencies accountable for events like July 13 when there was an assassination attempt on President Trump.</h5>\n<p>Crane told Bannon that transparency issues related to January 6th have potentially serious implications, describing how the Secret Service allegedly restricted communication channels after the event. \"If these reports are accurate,” Crane said, \"this is a massive failure of accountability – or even worse, a cover-up.”</p>\n<h3>Bottom Line for Voters: Transparency in Government Matters</h3>\n<p>As Election Day nears, Crane wants voters to understand why these issues matter. He insists that addressing potential cover-ups isn’t just a political talking point—it’s a fundamental responsibility. Crane encouraged voters to consider the importance of government transparency when they head to the polls.</p>\n<p>\"Remember, it’s your government. These bureaucracies work for you, not the other way around,” he concluded. For Crane, a vote for accountability and transparency is for a stronger, more trustworthy government.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources for this article on how to get involved:</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/join-the-revolution-mobilizing-the-warroom-community-for-huge-election-impact/\">Join the Revolution: Mobilizing the WarRoom Community for Huge Election Impact!</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Communication Restrictions Post-Jan 6th</h3>\n<p>Crane shared that the DHS Inspector General recently sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. This letter flagged troubling restrictions on Secret Service communications immediately following January 6th, allegedly limiting agents’ ability to engage in group chats and send photos using government-issued phones.</p>\n<p>According to Crane, \"These limitations force agents to use their personal phones for official communications, even when operating overseas.” This poses two key risks: compromised security and reduced accountability. \"Using private phones,” he explained, \"means it’s a lot harder for investigators to access critical communications when they need it most.”</p>\n<h3>Why This Matters to Voters</h3>\n<p>Crane argues that understanding these potential cover-ups is vital for voters. He points out that government transparency is foundational for a functioning democracy, particularly in matters involving public safety and crisis response. With allegations that Secret Service agents were told to switch to personal devices after January 6th, Crane sees a pattern he believes is meant to \"circumvent oversight and reduce transparency.”</p>\n<p>For Crane, the timing is significant. \"This protocol change happened right after January 6th,” he said. \"It looks to me, and to others watching this closely, like an intentional move to prevent Congress from fully investigating what went down.”</p>\n<h3>Accountability Is Key</h3>\n<p>Voters should demand transparency, Crane emphasized, because these communication gaps can hinder critical investigations. Not having access to complete records means potentially missing out on important information. Crane explained, \"When federal agencies start taking steps to avoid oversight, it’s a red flag – we need accountability at every level of government.”</p>\n<p>Crane made it clear that for him, this isn’t just about one event. It’s a broader concern about federal agencies potentially evading their responsibilities to the American public. “This is one more reason why this election is so important,” Crane said. \"Our bureaucracies need an overhaul, and voters need to know what they’re up against.”</p>\n<h3>The Broader Implications: Security and Trust</h3>\n<p>Crane’s revelations also raised concerns about national security. Secret Service agents using personal phones could expose sensitive information to potential hacking or foreign threats. \"It’s reckless and endangers everyone,” Crane stated, arguing that voters should know if the agencies meant to protect them are potentially compromising security.</p>\n<p>In his view, this is about restoring trust and ensuring government accountability. \"We’re seeing more and more attempts to go around established rules,” Crane said. \"It’s up to the American people to demand better.”</p>\n<p>For more of our coverage of Eli Crane:</p>\n<p>L<a href=\"https://warroom.org/livestreaming-ballot-drop-boxes-and-urgent-help-needed-for-az-justin-heap-us-rep-eli-crane-explains/\">ivestreaming Ballot Drop Boxes and Urgent Help Needed For AZ Justin Heap: US Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>What Bannon Said</h3>\n<h5>Steve Bannon said on Thursday’s WarRoom that he believes the key to victory lies in mobilizing low-propensity voters—those who don’t always show up at the polls but could be decisive. Using what he calls \"match play” strategy, Bannon emphasizes that each vote carries strategic weight. To him, it’s about winning targeted rounds of influence and control, not just a popular vote. With this mindset, he urges values-driven voters to see their role as essential in an outcome he considers critical for preserving traditional American values.</h5>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"For next Tuesday, if you’re able, start early voting and take some of the pressure off Election Day. We need a huge mobilization, especially in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona. The more people who can get out and vote now in early voting, the more capacity we’ll have on Election Day to drive this effort forward. There’s a lot happening with get-out-the-vote operations, and every early vote makes a difference,” Bannon said on Thursday. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<h3>Match Play vs. Stroke Play: What’s the Difference?</h3>\n<p>In his Thursday remarks, Bannon explained his \"match play” analogy to emphasize focused strategy over sheer numbers. Borrowing from golf, where “match play” is about winning specific rounds instead of the total strokes, Bannon noted: “This is not a popularity contest. It’s about securing wins where it counts.” For the MAGA movement, that means mobilizing enough voters in each critical area to secure decisive, localized victories. Bannon’s message: \"It’s the match-ups that matter. The goal is to hit 270 electoral votes, not just win the popular vote.”</p>\n<h3>Low-Propensity Voters Are Key</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s appeal is directed at \"low-propensity voters”—those who may not vote regularly or don’t always see a personal stake in politics. For Bannon, these voters are often guided by values over party, and he urges them to \"show up and vote your conscience.” He points to key areas like Arizona and Pennsylvania, where small changes in turnout could be pivotal. He called this a \"mass mobilization for representation” and stressed that low-propensity voters hold the power to counter what he considers attempts to delegitimize the MAGA movement’s influence.</p>\n<h3>Values-Driven Voting: A Moral Imperative</h3>\n<p>Throughout his speech, Bannon framed voting as a values-based, even spiritual act. He called for \"the Christian turnout” as a deciding factor, urging faith-based communities to engage actively. \"It’s a command. It’s about voting for values, for economic stability, for cultural preservation,” he said, positioning the act of voting as a moral imperative for those who identify with the movement’s aims. He criticized what he sees as moral and cultural decay, calling for \"100 million” Christian voters to show up as a \"divine mandate” in their communities.</p>\n<h3>“Victory Begins the Mission, It Doesn’t End There”</h3>\n<p>Bannon made it clear that he sees this election as the beginning of a larger mission, not an endpoint. \"Remember, November 5th—it doesn’t end there. It begins there,” he said, urging his audience to think of their votes as a launch point for more significant societal change. He called this the \"end of the beginning,” a crucial step in a much longer process to reclaim and stabilize what he sees as American foundational values.</p>\n<h3>The Battle Ahead</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s final message was to push forward regardless of obstacles. \"We cannot lose focus on the purpose,” he said, emphasizing the importance of staying engaged beyond election day. He views the \"mass mobilization” effort as the groundwork for a lasting impact, stressing, \"The energy and spirit of this movement is material; it’s palpable. We must execute, and we must not deter.”</p>\n<p>For Bannon, it’s a “match play” to reclaim values, re-engage low-propensity voters, and make an enduring impact on America’s political landscape.</p>\n<p>For more of our coverage on Low Propensity voters:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/revival-of-bold-faith-christian-leaders-liberate-voters-for-a-spiritual-battle-in-the-upcoming-election/\">Revival of Bold Faith: Christian Leaders Liberate Voters for a Spiritual Battle in the Upcoming Election</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/grassroots-surge-jbms-battle-plan-to-mobilize-georgia-voters-and-safeguard-the-election/\">Grassroots Surge: JBM’s Battle Plan to Mobilize Georgia Voters and Safeguard the Election</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/lack-of-trump-campaign-urgency-for-ground-game-spurs-ralph-reed-to-mobilize-christian-voters-to-save-the-republic/\">Lack of Trump Campaign Urgency for Ground Game Spurs Ralph Reed to Mobilize Christian Voters to Save the Republic</a></strong></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://warroom.org/countdown-to-270-trumps-50-state-strategy-from-matt-boyle-key-election-stats-you-need-to-know/\">Countdown to 270 : Trump’s 50-State Strategy From Matt Boyle, Key Election Stats You Need to Know</a></h3>\n<p><strong>For more context on Bannon’s Thursday remarks, watch this WarRoom segment:</strong></p>\n<h1>Steve Bannon Prepares For Marc Elias Full-Scale Push Against A President Trump Victory</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The US House Oversight and Accountability Committee, led by Chairman James Comer, released a staff report on Thursday October 24,  criticizing the Biden-Harris Administration for lacking a comprehensive strategy to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) influence and infiltration efforts in the United States. The report, titled <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCP-Report-10.24.24.pdf\">\"<strong>CCP Political Warfare: Federal Agencies Urgently Need a Government-Wide Strategy</strong></a><strong>,”</strong> highlights findings from an investigation into 25 federal sectors, revealing that most federal agencies have inadequately addressed the CCP’s tactics. It emphasizes that the CCP views the U.S. as a primary adversary and has deeply infiltrated American institutions, businesses, and cultural spheres.</p>\n<p>Key points include the CCP’s use of non-military tactics to influence U.S. communities and critical sectors and federal agencies’ failure to respond effectively. The report assigns agencies scores based on their strategy, knowledge, transparency, and collaboration performance.</p>\n<p>Recommendations urge federal agencies to utilize existing resources to combat CCP influence by clearly acknowledging the threat, rejecting general approaches, fostering expertise, and engaging the American public on the CCP’s ambitions. Principled leadership and transparent communication are crucial to countering the CCP’s political warfare.</p>\n<p><span>On Friday’s WarRoom, host, and WarRoom contributor, <a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-stages-of-trumps-victory-from-election-to-inauguration/\">Dr. Bradley Thayer</a> discussed the recent Oversight Committee report, and he emphasized that it is a crucial read for all Americans, especially with the upcoming election, highlighting how the CCP is “undermining the foundations of the United States in every respect.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Thayer commended the committee’s effort, calling it a “great report” and noting that it’s about 300 pages long. He humorously suggested that it might require more than “one cup of coffee” to get through but assured that “with a pot of coffee,” it’s well worth the time for anyone interested in understanding the CCP threat.</span></p>\n<p>The executive summary of the report emphasizes the increasing threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the United States, characterizing it as an aggressive campaign of “unrestricted warfare” targeting all aspects of American society. The CCP is described as a “totalitarian force” that engages in harmful activities, including surveillance, harassment of critics, and the spread of fentanyl, which kills “tens of thousands of Americans every year.” The CCP’s ultimate goal is to “weaken or, if possible, destroy” the United States, viewing the American way of life as a threat to its authoritarian rule.</p>\n<p>The report criticizes the Biden-Harris Administration for failing to adopt a government-wide strategy to counter these tactics, noting that out of 25 federal agencies investigated, only the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) showed a clear strategy against CCP-backed activities. However, even the DEA’s efforts are limited due to the lack of a cohesive national approach.</p>\n<p>The findings highlight that CCP influence operations have penetrated U.S. borders, institutions, and elites, creating dependencies that hinder effective responses. This contrasts with the unified and efficient strategy of the CCP, which the report claims is fully committed to winning a new cold war against America. “Unlike the first Cold War,” the CCP is already “entrenched within U.S. borders,” manipulating sectors like businesses, universities, and cultural centers.</p>\n<p>The report calls for strong leadership to honestly address the CCP threat, stressing the need for a transparent acknowledgment of the problem by federal officials. It concludes that the U.S. must “confront the CCP squarely” to maintain its global preeminence, urging the federal government to communicate clearly with Americans about the risks posed by CCP infiltration.</p>\n<p>More of our coverage of Dr. Thayer’s WarRoom appearances:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/chinas-shadow-war-dr-bradley-thayer-exposes-ccps-global-schemes-and-u-s-strategic-failures/\">China’s Shadow War, Dr. Bradley Thayer Exposes CCP’s Global Schemes and U.S. Strategic Failures</a></strong></p>\n<p>Recent Press Releases:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-exposing-the-ccps-destructive-political-warfare-and-influence-operation/\">Oversight Committee Releases Report Exposing the CCP’s Destructive Political Warfare and Influence Operations</a></h4>\n<h5><a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-announces-third-hearing-on-chinas-political-warfare-and-the-federal-governments-failure-to-address-ccp-influence-operations/\">Comer Announces Third Hearing on China’s Political Warfare and the Federal Government’s Failure to Address CCP Influence Operations</a></h5>\n<h4><a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/release/hearing-wrap-up-federal-agencies-have-succumbed-to-ccp-influence-and-the-oversight-committee-is-demanding-answers/\">Hearing Wrap Up: Federal Agencies Have Succumbed to CCP Influence and the Oversight Committee is Demanding Answers</a></h4>\n<p>For more context from Dr. Thayer Watch the Opening of Friday’s Battleground WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>WarRoom Battleground EP 641: The Human Issue Surrounding This Election</h1>\n</div>\n"

Trump working the McDonald’s fry station and manning the drive-thru. Afterwards, President Trump held a packed town hall hosted by former ESPN anchor Sage Steele in Lancaster, followed by Acrisure Stadium erupting in <a href=\"https://x.com/blairbrandt/status/1848181051471942113?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>chants</span></a> of U-S-A when President Trump arrived at the Pittsburgh Steelers game Sunday night.</p>\n<p>And they say this race is \"tied.”</p>\n<p>That was just on Sunday.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>Summary of Stephen Bannon’s Statement on His Incarceration</h3>\n<p>In a recent statement to <a href=\"https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/10/18/exclusive-bannon-jail-statement-biden-harris-are-illegally-holding-me-past-my-release-date/\">The National Pulse</a>, Stephen K. Bannon, former chief advisor to President Trump, host of the WarRoom and a leading proponent of the Populist/MAGA movement, claimed that the Biden-Harris administration is illegally holding him in prison beyond his eligible release date under the First Step Act. According to the article, Bannon accused Vice President Kamala Harris of being “the Queen of Mass Incarcerations,” asserting that her policies have favored illegal migrants while neglecting U.S. citizens eligible for early release.</p>\n<p>Bannon was sentenced to serve four months, starting July 1, 2024, in a federal correctional facility for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena,<a href=\"https://warroom.org/stephen-k-bannons-attorney-statement-regarding-court-of-appeals-decision/\"> citing executive privilege</a> for President Trump, in connection with the unconstitutional US House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Bannon’s comments deliver a sharp critique and a blistering rebuke of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s lack of support for Congress-approved criminal justice reform.</p>\n<p>The Full Statement:</p>\n<h3>Bannon’s Criticism of the Biden-Harris Administration</h3>\n<p>In the Nation Pulse article, Bannon expressed his frustration over a failure to implement the First Step Act effectively. \"Kamala Harris has done nothing to implement President Trump’s heroic First Step Act,” he stated, emphasizing the act’s intention to reduce the federal prison population and improve rehabilitation opportunities for non-violent offenders. He criticized the administration for not addressing the needs of U.S. citizens while welcoming “hundreds of thousands of hardened illegal migrant criminals.”</p>\n<p>His comments are specific to resonate in the minds of voters, predominantly Black and Hispanic men, whom he claims are disillusioned with Harris’s approach to criminal justice.</p>\n<h3>Details of the First Step Act</h3>\n<p>The<strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.bop.gov/inmates/fsa/overview.jsp\">First Step Act</a></strong>, signed into law by President Trump on December 21, 2018, represents a significant reform in the federal prison system. According to the Bureau of Prisons, it aims to reduce recidivism and enhance public safety. One key provision allows inmates to earn time credits through participation in educational and vocational programs, which can lead to early release into pre-release custody. The act also expands compassionate release for elderly or terminally ill prisoners and prohibits the use of restraints on pregnant inmates. Additionally, it mandates that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) assist inmates in applying for federal and state benefits upon release.</p>\n<p>Bannon, who claims to be eligible for early release under this law, filed a motion for bail or supervised release on August 29, 2024. His legal team argues that the BOP should expedite his release, noting that the government has not responded to his petition for over 75 days. \"The Court should grant Mr. Bannon’s motion for bail pending completion of Supreme Court review,” his lawyers contend.</p>\n<h3>The Political Implications of Bannon’s Incarceration</h3>\n<p>Bannon’s release date is expected to be October 29, 2024, but he argues that the current administration is deliberately delaying it to undermine his influence in the upcoming elections. He claimed, \"The Harris Bureau of Prisons is illegally holding me past my legal release date—trying to eliminate one of President Trump’s strongest advocates.” This narrative positions Bannon as a political prisoner and a key player in the electoral landscape, particularly among those who feel abandoned by current leadership.</p>\n<p>Bannon concluded his statement with criticisms of Harris’s track record, particularly concerning family reunification for American citizens in prison. He suggested her neglect in this area could severely impact her electoral prospects, especially in key cities like Philadelphia and Detroit. His comments rally support among his base, framing his legal battles as part of a broader struggle against a political establishment he deems corrupt and ineffective.</p>\n<h3>What About the Families of Prisoners?</h3>\n<p>There is a contentious political climate surrounding criminal justice reform and the electoral landscape, with one party—the Republicans—embracing reforms and Democrats punishing their opponents.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s claims regarding the First Step Act raise critical questions about the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to implementing effective reforms and addressing the needs of incarcerated individuals.</p>\n<p>As the election nears, Bannon’s situation could become a focal point for discussions about justice, rehabilitation, and the political motives behind current incarceration policies.</p>\n<p>For more of our coverage of Political Prisoner Steve Bannon:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/matt-boyle-reports-moneyball-strategy-voter-registration-surge-excites-steve-bannon-weeks-ahead-of-prison-release/\">Matt Boyle Reports Moneyball Strategy: Voter Registration Surge Excites Steve Bannon Weeks Ahead of Prison Release</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/celebrating-the-release-of-political-prisoner-steve-bannon-dan-fleuette-discusses-his-book-rebels-rogues-and-outlaws/\">Celebrating the Release of Political Prisoner, Steve Bannon: Dan Fleuette Discusses His Book ‘Rebels, Rogues, and Outlaws’</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/message-from-steve-bannon-from-prison-mobilize-voters-and-election-workers-to-stop-the-steal/\">Message from Steve Bannon from Prison: ‘Mobilize Voters and Election Workers to Stop the Steal’</a></strong></p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h3>Key Issues Ignored by Mainstream Media</h3>\n<h5>Peter Navarro, a former advisor to President Trump hosted the Wednesday WarRoom, and criticized MSNBC’s coverage of economic policies, particularly regarding the working class and American manufacturing. When discussing critical economic issues, he highlighted the \"staggering ignorance” of commentators like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes. Navarro pointed out that these mainstream media figures often misinterpret the implications of tariffs and trade practices.</h5>\n<h3>Bannon and the Dollar Crisis</h3>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.birchgold.com/bannon-dollar-empire/\">Bannon End of the Dollar Empire Series</a></strong></p>\n<p>Navarro defended Steve Bannon against MSNBC’s criticism for his publication about the decline of the US dollar Empire. He explained that Bannon’s commentary focuses on how Vice President Kamala Harris’s fiscal irresponsibility damages the dollar. \"It’s not about wanting the dollar to decline,” Navarro stated. \"It’s about defending the dollar against left-wing policies that undermine it.” He argued that such policies disproportionately harm working-class Americans.</p>\n<h3>Manufacturing Jobs Under Threat</h3>\n<p>One of Navarro’s key points is the impact of globalism on American auto workers. He stated that workers have been reduced to mere assemblers of foreign-made parts. \"The auto workers have been reduced by globalists to simply assembling Chinese parts,” he lamented. This situation has diminished the role of American workers and factories, jeopardizing domestic production.</p>\n<h3>The Role of Tariffs in Job Preservation</h3>\n<p>Navarro advocated for Trump’s tariff policies as a means to protect American jobs. He explained that these tariffs help counter unfair trade practices from countries like China and Germany. \"When you defend against that with tariffs, you bring home the factories,” he asserted. Navarro’s message is clear: protecting manufacturing jobs is crucial for revitalizing the American economy and ensuring prosperity for workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.</p>\n<h3>Urgent Need for Action</h3>\n<p>Navarro also criticized recent labor agreements that threaten to outsource jobs to China. He emphasized that rank-and-file workers, especially in key battleground states, want to produce essential parts, not just assemble them. \"They are voting for Donald Trump because they don’t want to be turned into assembly workers,” he explained. This sentiment is crucial for understanding the political landscape as the 2024 election approaches.</p>\n<h3>A Call to Activism for America First</h3>\n<p>As the 2024 election draws near, Navarro warns that the stakes are high. He believes that a Democratic victory would exacerbate the nation’s already staggering $35 trillion national debt. \"It’s like throwing gas on a dumpster fire,” he cautioned. Navarro insists that the American people hold the power in this election.</p>\n<h3>A Pivotal Moment for America</h3>\n<p>In this critical moment, Navarro’s insights serve as a rallying cry for the America First movement. The focus on economic nationalism, job protection, and a strong defense against globalist policies is not just a campaign strategy—it is a necessity for the future of American workers. The upcoming election is not merely a political contest; it is a battle for the economic well-being of everyday Americans. Navarro’s passionate defense of these principles resonates strongly with the challenges facing the nation today, urging Americans to take action and support policies that prioritize their interests.</p>\n<p><strong>For more about the importance of US Manufacturing in this election:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/revitalizing-america-warroom-exposes-ccps-economic-woes-the-pathway-to-bring-manufacturing-back-to-the-rust-belt/\">Revitalizing America: WarRoom Exposes CCP’s Economic Woes the Pathway to Bring Manufacturing Back to the Rust Belt</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/ric-grenell-slams-comcasts-impact-on-media-us-manufacturing-and-us-safety/\">Ric Grenell Slams Comcast’s Impact on Media, US Manufacturing, and US Safety</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-anti-manufacturing-agenda-understanding-its-impact-on-american-freedom-and-economy/\">The Anti-Manufacturing Agenda: Understanding Its Impact on American Freedom and Economy</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>More of our coverage of Trump’s love of Tariffs:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/bannons-warroom-breaks-down-trump-tariffs-and-the-fight-for-american-prosperity/\">Bannon’s WarRoom Breaks Down Trump Tariffs and the Fight for American Prosperity</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/reviving-hamiltons-real-legacy-how-trumps-vision-of-economic-prosperity-harks-back-to-americas-founding-principles/\">Reviving Hamilton’s Real Legacy: How Trump’s Vision of Economic Prosperity Harks Back to America’s Founding Principles</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more context on Navarro’s Wednesday comments on the WarRoom:</strong></p>\n<h1>Peter Navarro: Lies From Maddow And Hayes On Tariffs And Trump Economy</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Voting just began in Georgia, and the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections is busy paying an attorney<span> $600 an hour </span>to try to block independent monitors from getting to observe the count. The Fulton Election Board filed a <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-07-Complaint.pdf\"><span>lawsuit against </span></a>the State Election Board for their proposal to add two additional – and actually independent – monitors to observe the 2024 voting and counting process.</p>\n<p>The only problem: the Fulton Elections Board never voted to hire the attorney, Michael W. Tyler, or file a lawsuit against the State Election Board. This decision was made unilaterally by Sherri Allen, the chair of the elections board.</p>\n<p>Fulton County Commissioner Bridget Thorne attempted to have the matter discussed at the commissioners meeting on Wednesday, but failed to secure a supermajority to add the item to the agenda. Thorne said the lawsuit was filed \"without approval by the actual Board of Elections members.”</p>\n<p>\"We basically have an unelected official making the decision to spend $600 per hour for outside counsel that we did not approve,” she said.</p>\n<p>Why does Fulton County have a monitoring team in the first place? The historic State Election Board case SEB2023-025, which <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>proved</span></a> over 20,000 unsubstantiated votes were inserted into the machine recount in 2020. The Secretary of State’s office attempted to brush the complaint aside at the May 7 State Election Board meeting, but admitted there were thousands of duplicate ballots in the recount, while trying to avoid the fact that <a href=\"https://warroom.org/report-3930-duplicates-in-fulton-county-in-2020-were-intentional-fraud/\"><span>they were counted</span></a>. In trying to brush the fraud from 2020 aside, former State Election Board Member Ed Lindsey <a href=\"https://warroom.org/raffensperger-fulton-county-try-to-ram-through-2020-clean-up-crew-as-independent-monitors-for-2024/\"><span>made plans</span></a> with the Secretary of State’s office and Fulton County to resolve the case before its findings were even presented to the board. The plan was to have a \"mutually agreeable” monitoring team and a letter of reprimand, however, the agreement was <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1838378963132965011?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>contingent</span></a> on the State Election Board voting on a team at its July meeting. This never happened. Fulton County unilaterally appointed its own team – led by none other than Brad Raffensperger’s general counsel during 2020, Ryan Germany, an election fraud denier who threw his own hat into the monitoring ring to make sure what happens in Fulton County stays in Fulton County.</p>\n<p>To recap: one of the most corrupt election offices in the country appointed its own team to monitor its elections led by the same people who <a href=\"https://x.com/realLizUSA/status/1821208067289100423\"><span>deny</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://warroom.org/report-3930-duplicates-in-fulton-county-in-2020-were-intentional-fraud/\"><span>proven election fraud</span></a> happened in 2020, which is why there is a monitoring team in the first place. The fake monitoring team is already <a href=\"https://x.com/realLizUSA/status/1846602858566725712\"><span>refusing to monitor things like test ballots</span></a>. The one silver lining is because Fulton County refused to cooperate on a real monitoring team, the State Election Board voted to subpoena <a href=\"https://x.com/realLizUSA/status/1843692068109221932\"><span>all the election records</span></a> from 2020 to finish its investigation into SEB2023-025.</p>\n<p>Dr. Janice Johnson, now the vice chair of the Georgia State Election Board, had sought to add real outside observers to Fulton County, including Heather Honey, an independent expert on elections who has uncovered <a href=\"https://verityvote.us/long-withheld-records-reveal-more-than-20000-mail-ballots-received-after-the-legal-deadline/\"><span>irrefutable</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://verityvote.us/maricopa-dropbox-chain-of-custody/\"><span>evidence</span></a> of law violations in multiple states affecting the counting of <a href=\"https://verityvote.us/pennsylvania-voter-deficit/\"><span>hundreds of thousands</span></a> of votes during the 2020 Election.</p>\n<p>Fulton County is staunchly opposed to real observers, going so far to break their own rules to hire a high-priced taxpayer-funded attorney to stop it from happening.</p>\n<p>If Georgia elections are so safe, so secure, and so accurate, why are they so terrified of anyone seeing the results?</p>\n<p>This includes blocking its own election board members like Julie Adams, who had to sue to get access to her own county’s records. Of course, Judge Robert McBurney, the same judge who presided over the bogus grand jury investigation into President Trump, just recently ruled she can have access, but she <span>has to certify no matter what</span>, even in the event of \"fraud or systemic error.”</p>\n<p>McBurney (<a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1842368131114655996?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>are there only two judges</span></a> in Georgia?) also ruled against a critical State Election Board rule requiring the hand counting of ballots after the polls close on Election Day, a basic reconciliation process that should be done in every jurisdiction in America.</p>\n<p>They don’t want you to hand count, they don’t want you to see the results, they don’t want any objective observer to watch them…it’s almost as if <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-do-i-know-theyre-going-to-cheat-because-they-already-are/\"><span>they’re going to cheat</span></a>.</p>\n</div>\n"

With over $15 million in Democratic funding targeting the race, Underwood stresses that grassroots efforts are key to maintaining control. Underwood asked people to join the Trump Get Out The Vote Efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://swampthevoteusa.com/\">Swamp The Vote</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/\">Trump Force 47</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Nebraska’s Unique Electoral System Could Decide the Election</h3>\n<p>Eric Underwood, a congressional candidate in Nebraska, is raising the alarm about the importance of Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District (CD2) in the upcoming 2024 election. Nebraska is one of the few states that splits its electoral votes by Congressional district, and CD2, which includes Omaha, is fiercely contested. Underwood emphasizes, \"This district doesn’t just decide a Congressional seat. It’s tied directly to one critical electoral vote for President Trump.”</p>\n<h3>Democrats Pour Millions Into Tight Race</h3>\n<p>The stakes are high in CD2, with Republican Congressman Don Bacon defending his seat in a highly competitive race. Underwood points out, \"The Democrats have dumped over $15 million into this district, and they’re bringing in the same candidate to challenge Bacon again.” He underscores the strategic importance of this electoral vote, explaining, \"In a race that could come down to 270 versus 268 electoral votes, losing CD2 would be a devastating blow.”</p>\n<h3>Voter Turnout Is Key to Victory</h3>\n<p>Underwood stresses the importance of voter mobilization. \"Everything now is about getting out the vote,” he says, encouraging Trump supporters to engage in grassroots efforts. The Trump Force 47 initiative, along with county Republican parties, is spearheading voter outreach in key areas like Douglas, Sarpy, and Saunders counties. \"These local efforts are putting boots on the ground, going door-to-door, connecting directly with voters,” Underwood adds.</p>\n<h3>Dark Money and Globalist Influence</h3>\n<p>Underwood also raises concerns about outside influence in the race, citing significant contributions from wealthy donors and special interest groups. \"We’re seeing dark money from George Soros and globalist PACs flooding this race,” he warns. Underwood views this influx of Democratic funding as an effort to tip the scales in a race that could impact the national electoral outcome.</p>\n<h3>Why CD2 Matters for Trump’s Re-election</h3>\n<p>Underwood believes that winning CD2 is crucial for Trump’s re-election. \"This election could very well come down to one electoral vote, and Nebraska is in a unique position,” he explains. With Nebraska’s electoral votes split between statewide results and individual Congressional districts, a win in CD2 could give Trump an essential edge in a close election.</p>\n<h3>Call to Action: Boots on the Ground</h3>\n<p>To combat the Democratic push in CD2, Underwood is calling on Trump supporters to rally behind local Republican efforts. He encourages people to get involved through social media platforms like Trump Force 47 and to volunteer in local get-out-the-vote campaigns. \"This is where the fight is,” Underwood says, urging the War Room audience to engage in the final stretch before Election Day.</p>\n<p>In closing, Underwood left a stark reminder of what’s at stake: \"This election is too close to leave any vote on the table. CD2 could be the deciding factor in 2024.”</p>\n<p>For more from Eric Underwood about Nebraska watch this segment from Monday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Eric Underwood Reveals Crucial Role NE CD-2 Can Play In Securing President Trump’s Victory</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Royce White, Senate candidate from Minnesota and guest host on Steve Bannon’s Saturday WarRoom  did not hold back in his take down of  <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/george-soros-hands-control-25-billion-empire-son-alex-rcna88806\">George Soros and his son, Alex Soros</a>. White accused the Soros family of using their wealth to corrupt American politics, damaging democracy for personal gain. He referred to the billionaire’s approach to politics as “crack dealer logic,” a term meant to illustrate how Soros manipulates power for the benefit of an elite few while the rest of the nation suffers.</p>\n<h3>Soros’ Influence and Elite Control</h3>\n<p>White argues that George Soros and other billionaires have too much influence over global and American politics. “There is a crisis in American political culture when a man like this is able to give billions” to control the political system, White stated. He criticized the Democratic Party for embracing figures like Soros, asserting that their financial power serves only to benefit the elite at the expense of ordinary citizens. White sees this as part of a broader strategy to rob people of their civil liberties, undermining their ability to govern themselves.</p>\n<h3>Crack Dealer Logic: Manipulation for Power</h3>\n<p>White used the phrase “crack dealer logic” to describe Soros’ moral relativism and his manipulation of political dynamics. According to White, Soros compares societal issues like the Holocaust to market transactions, using them to justify his financial and political actions. “It’s the same crack dealer logic that uses addiction to control people,” White explained. In his view, Soros exploits political crises and uses his wealth to control politicians, keeping power in the hands of a select few while leaving the rest of the country to suffer.</p>\n<p>White’s analogy of “crack dealer logic” paints Soros as someone who offers solutions to problems he helped create only to gain more control over society. He suggests that this approach is not only corrupt but dangerous. “George Soros is a thief,” White declares, accusing Soros of profiting from political instability while eroding the nation’s democratic foundations.</p>\n<h3>A Nation Left to Suffer</h3>\n<p>White argued that Soros’ actions result in widespread injustice. While the elite few benefit from his manipulation of politics, the rest of America suffers from rising inequality, violence, and loss of freedoms. He linked Soros’ influence to increasing social decay, saying, “The American people are left to suffer injustices and the removal of their civil liberties to govern themselves.” According to White, Soros and his allies ensure that the masses remain dependent, just like addicts under a dealer’s control.</p>\n<h3>The Removal of Civil Liberties</h3>\n<p>White warned that Soros’ influence is stripping Americans of their ability to govern themselves. He claimed that the billionaire’s power not only corrupts politicians but also undermines the people’s right to shape their own destinies. “It’s about more than money. It’s about control,” White said, emphasizing how Soros’ political donations result in policies that limit individual freedoms.</p>\n<p>In White’s view, the rise of elites like George and Alex Soros represents a direct threat to the core values of American democracy. The more power they gain, the more the common people lose their voice.</p>\n<p><strong>For more of our coverage of Royce White:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/go-into-the-belly-of-the-beast-a-call-from-royce-white-to-rescue-deep-blue-territories-and-save-the-republic/\">\"Go Into the Belly of the Beast”: A Call From Royce White to Rescue Deep Blue Territories and Save the Republic</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/royce-white-and-dave-brat-call-for-unity-america-first-platform-to-bridge-racial-divides-and-save-the-nation/\">Royce White and Dave Brat Call for Unity: America First Platform to Bridge Racial Divides and Save the Nation</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/time-to-reclaim-our-citizenship-royce-white-exposes-the-democratic-ponzi-scheme-on-black-americans/\">Time to Reclaim Our Citizenship: Royce White Exposes the Democratic ‘Ponzi Scheme’ on Black Americans</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/wage-slaves-and-civic-duty-royce-whites-call-to-action-against-economic-imperialism/\">Wage Slaves and Civic Duty: Royce White’s Call to Action Against Economic Imperialism</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context to Royce White’s Saturday appearance on the WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Royce White: Globalists, Like George And Alex Soros, Have The Morals Of Drug Dealers</h1>\n<h1>Royce White: Now’s The Time To Identify Who’s With Us And Who’s A Sellout Globalist</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Erik Prince’s reaction<span> on Thursday’s WarRoom to a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/steve-bannon-nato-world-order\">Vanity Fair article</a> criticizing Steve Bannon and his followers was sharp and revealing. According to Prince, the article </span>was full of misinformation about Bannon’s true mission. He highlighted Bannon’s dedication to empowering voters through “nonviolent civic action” and providing crucial information for informed electoral choices. The Vanity Fair piece missed the mark, portraying Bannon’s strategy as far more radical than it actually is.</p>\n<h2>Vanity Fair’s Misinformation on Steve Bannon’s Mission</h2>\n<p>The Vanity Fair article in question painted Steve Bannon and Prince as dangerous instigators.  It falsely suggested that the WarRoom and its audience promote aggressive and even violent tactics.</p>\n<p>Erik Prince quickly addressed these inaccuracies. Bannon has been crystal clear—he’s calling for peaceful civic participation. Bannon’s WarRoom encourages people to get involved in their local communities, run for office, and work within the system, not against it.</p>\n<p>In his defense, Prince emphasized that Bannon’s strategy revolves around constitutional principles and civic engagement.</p>\n<p>The goal, as WarRoom viewers know, is to inspire voters to “stand up, speak out, and act within the law.”</p>\n<p>The WarRoom’s mission, according to Prince, is about giving the American people the information they need to make informed choices at the polls—not to incite disorder.</p>\n<h2>Erik Prince Stresses Civic Action and Nonviolence</h2>\n<p>One of Prince’s key arguments is that the WarRoom’s approach is grounded in nonviolent civic action. “Everything Bannon talks about,” Prince stated, “is about playing within the system.” This means pushing back against globalism, holding elites accountable, and reshaping the American government to serve its people better—all through legal, democratic means.</p>\n<p>Prince pointed out how Bannon consistently reminds his audience to get involved in school boards, local councils, and community organizing. This is where real change happens. It is the opposite of the radical narrative pushed by Vanity Fair.</p>\n<h2>Voter Education: Empowering the American People</h2>\n<p>Beyond the misinformation, Prince stressed the importance of Bannon’s WarRoom in providing “news and information that helps voters make choices.” For Prince, this is a critical service in an era where mainstream media often fails to cover the concerns of everyday Americans. Bannon’s focus is on informing the public about immigration, the economy, and national security—issues that directly impact voters but are often glossed over in mainstream narratives.</p>\n<p>As Bannon knows \"If you give voters the facts, they will make the right decision.” This is where Bannon’s influence lies: arming voters with the facts and encouraging them to engage actively in the democratic process. For all the negative press, this is what the WarRoom is about—educating and empowering voters, not undermining the system.</p>\n<h2>The Role of the WarRoom in Restoring American Greatness</h2>\n<p>Prince also credited Steve Bannon with having foresight on key issues like immigration, the military, and America’s global standing. “Steve’s been right for a long time,” Prince remarked. Bannon’s stance against endless wars, open borders, and unchecked financial elites resonates with many Americans. He has effectively connected these issues with the broader goal of restoring American greatness.</p>\n<p>Vanity Fair may dismiss Bannon as a radical, but Prince made it clear that Bannon’s strategy is about empowerment and lawful action. He summarized the WarRoom’s mission as a movement rooted in “Jacksonian accountability,” aimed at cleaning up the dead wood in government while ensuring the American people remain informed and engaged.</p>\n<h2>Misinformation and Media Bias</h2>\n<p>The blistering Vanity Fair article may have tried to undermine Steve Bannon, but as Erik Prince emphasized, it missed the real story. The WarRoom isn’t about incitement—it’s about informed, nonviolent civic action.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>U.S. national security is facing unprecedented threats from China under the Biden-Harris administration, according to WarRoom experts. From military escalation in the Indo-Pacific to political influence campaigns, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) aims to undermine U.S. power and disrupt global peace. The stakes are rising, and November’s election could determine the direction of U.S. foreign policy in the face of these dangers, according to a Wednesday discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and Capt. Jim Fanell.</strong></p>\n<h3>China’s Missile Test: A Clear Threat to U.S. Security</h3>\n<p>China launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test in the South China Sea in 44 years. This missile, likely a<a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/25/china-test-fires-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-pacific-ocean.html\"> DF-41</a>, has a range of up to 9,000 miles, capable of hitting U.S. targets. Col. Jim Fanell described the test as “shocking,” emphasizing that China is \"practicing to destroy America.” The implications are stark: China’s strategic rocket force is growing more capable, and their political will to confront the U.S. is undeniable.</p>\n<h3>Loss of Key U.S. Base: China’s Quiet Victory in the Indo-Pacific</h3>\n<p>Recent developments also threaten America’s strategic presence in the Indo-Pacific. The United Kingdom turned over Diego Garcia, a joint U.S.-UK military base in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius. Fanell compared this loss to the situation in Afghanistan, stating, “We will now potentially lose access to Diego Garcia,” a move he called a victory for China. This jeopardizes U.S. ability to project power in the region and undermines security alliances with key partners like Japan and India.</p>\n<h3>Chinese Aggression Against the Philippines and Taiwan</h3>\n<p>China’s aggression isn’t limited to military exercises. The CCP has intensified threats against the Philippines and Taiwan, both critical U.S. allies. According to Fanell, “China is effectively trying to take over the South China Sea,” a crucial global shipping lane where $5 to $7 trillion of the world’s GDP passes through. By controlling these waters, China aims to push the U.S. out and dominate regional trade.</p>\n<p>Regarding Taiwan, Fanell warned of increased provocations: \"Crossing the center line with combat aircraft used to happen only a few times in 60 years. Now, it’s happening hundreds of times a year under the Biden-Harris regime.” Taiwan’s status as a self-sustaining democracy challenges China’s authoritarian model, and Beijing is ramping up its threats of force.</p>\n<h3>The CCP’s Military Expansions are Unchecked</h3>\n<p>Beyond Taiwan, China has made unprecedented moves against Japan, flying military aircraft into Japanese airspace and navigating warships within 12 nautical miles of Japanese territory. Fanell highlighted the seriousness of these moves, stating, \"They haven’t operated that far south before.” China is also expanding its military influence in Cambodia and along the Sino-Indian border, further destabilizing the region.</p>\n<p>North Korea’s Growing Threat\nFanell also pointed to the evolving threat from North Korea, which recently cut ties with South Korea and may be developing its own ballistic missile submarine. This adds another layer of complexity to an already tense situation in the Indo-Pacific. “If China decides to act in any of these regions, the U.S. military will come under attack,” Fanell warned.</p>\n<h3>Political Warfare and Influence Campaigns</h3>\n<p>China’s actions aren’t limited to military threats. Fanell and Thayer discussed how the CCP is employing political warfare to influence global perceptions and, potentially, U.S. elections. The CCP’s messaging, including the ICBM test, spy balloon incidents, and aggressive rhetoric, is meant to demonstrate China’s power and discourage American resistance. \"The Chinese Communist Party is sending powerful messages that their intent is to hurt the American people,” said Thayer.</p>\n<h3>A Call for Leadership</h3>\n<p>Fanell concluded with a stark message: the CCP’s pressure will continue, and the current administration’s \"neo-engagement” strategy isn’t working. The November election is pivotal, as the Chinese Communist Party “has a preferred candidate,” according to Fanell. Leadership capable of confronting these threats is crucial to safeguarding U.S. interests and global stability.</p>\n<p>Voters must ask the question: Will America’s next leader have the strength to resist China’s aggression?</p>\n<p>For more of our coverage on world events:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/urgent-warning-u-s-leadership-and-world-stability-at-stake-in-2024-election/\">Urgent Warning: U.S. Leadership and World Stability at Stake in 2024 Election</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/global-communism-in-race-against-time-chinas-unrestricted-warfare-is-a-six-month-race-to-taiwan/\">Global Communism in Race Against Time: China’s Unrestricted Warfare is a Six-Month Race to Taiwan</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/a-world-on-edge-face-of-rising-threats-warroom-experts-sound-the-alarm-on-u-s-strategic-withdrawals/\">A WORLD ON EDGE: Face of Rising Threats, WarRoom Experts Sound the Alarm on U.S. Strategic Withdrawals</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full interview between Dr. Thayer and Col.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>The proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by foreign entities poses a significant national security threat according to journalist Adam Molon who appeared on Wednesday’s WarRoom. Americans need to be aware of the potential economic and security implications before voting, as this issue affects not just steelworkers but all families and their financial well-being.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why U.S. Steel Matters for National Security</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ussteel.com/\">U.S. Steel</a> is an iconic pillar of America’s industrial foundation. Peter Navarro and Adam Molon warn that the acquisition by foreign corporations, especially ones operating in China, would weaken U.S. security. “This deal represents a clear and present national security threat,” Molon noted in a recent interview.</p>\n<h3>Foreign Ownership Means Losing Jobs and Benefits</h3>\n<p>A takeover could devastate American workers. Union leaders have already expressed their concerns. “Steelworkers are worried whether their jobs, benefits, and pensions will survive this deal,” said Navarro. If foreign companies take over, there’s a high chance of factory closures and outsourcing, leaving thousands of workers jobless.</p>\n<h3>The China Factor and National Defense</h3>\n<p>The greatest concern is the connection between foreign steel giants and China’s defense industry. Nepan Steel, one of the bidders, has ties to Chinese production facilities. This is alarming because “Nepan operates in China’s Xinjiang province, known for human rights abuses,” Molon stated. America’s steel supply must be protected to maintain the military’s capability to produce tanks, aircraft, and other critical defense equipment.</p>\n<h3>Economic Impact on All American Families</h3>\n<p>Even if you aren’t a steelworker, this deal affects you. Weakening the steel industry would lead to higher imports, weakening America’s economy. “If foreign companies control U.S. Steel, our entire economy becomes vulnerable,” Navarro warned. The ripple effect could lead to inflation, job losses across industries, and greater reliance on foreign powers.</p>\n<h3>Voters Need to Act</h3>\n<p>The upcoming election is pivotal for America’s manufacturing future. Voters need to understand that preserving U.S. Steel as an American-owned entity is essential for national security, economic strength, and protecting family livelihoods. As Navarro emphasized, “If Donald Trump gets back in office, he will not let that happen.”</p>\n<p>This is more than just a steel issue. It’s about securing our future.</p>\n<p><strong>For more from Adam Molon on the threats the US faces from the Chinese: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/molon-exposes-ccp-influence-on-u-s-politics-through-tim-walzs-china-connections-on-the-warroom/\">Molon Exposes CCP Influence on U.S. Politics Through Tim Walz’s China Connections on the WarRoom</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/dark-moneys-shadow-over-the-2024-election-the-lincoln-projects-corporate-backed-betrayal-of-civil-liberties/\">Dark Money’s Shadow Over the 2024 Election: The Lincoln Project’s Corporate-Backed Betrayal of Civil Liberties</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/democrat-tim-walz-and-the-bride-of-creepy-communism-comes-to-rule-the-usa/\">Democrat Tim Walz and the Bride of Creepy Communism Comes to Rule the USA</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context on Molon’s Wednesday comments, Watch:</p>\n<h1>Adam Molon: US Steel Buyout By Japanese Company Is Major National Security Threat</h1>\n</div>\n"

Catherine Engelbrecht’s conversation with Ben Harnwell highlights the critical need for leadership that delivers during crises, not just talks.</strong></p>\n<h3>Aid Delays: Why North Carolina Needs to Take Action</h3>\n<p>Catherine Engelbrecht with <a href=\"https://truethevote.org/\">True the Vote</a>, appeared on Tuesday WarRoom, speaking from the heart of North Carolina, emphasized that voters need to demand more from their leaders. After Hurricane Helene, aid was slow, communication was weak, and citizens were left to fend for themselves. \"We’re here installing radios to boost the Starlink signal,” Engelbrecht said, as she and her team worked to restore communication in the most devastated regions. But why are citizens being forced to step up when government should be taking the lead?</p>\n<p>It’s time to elect leaders who can handle emergencies and bring tangible solutions to the table. Engelbrecht’s frustration echoed the sentiments of many: \"These people want to vote—they want to make sure their voices are heard.” Voters should be asking themselves: Are our current leaders really delivering?</p>\n<h3>Voter Confidence is Shaky—Here’s Why It Shouldn’t Be</h3>\n<p>The storm didn’t just bring physical destruction; it also raised questions about voter access. Engelbrecht noted that despite the damage, election officials are trying to ensure the voting process remains intact. \"There’s a real stress on making sure people feel confident they can vote,” she stated. But confidence is fragile when basic services like communication are lagging.</p>\n<p>Engelbrecht urged voters to take action: \"These people would walk across broken glass to make sure their vote counts.” The time to demand better is now—by showing up at the polls, North Carolinians can hold their leaders accountable for their lackluster response to crises.</p>\n<h3>Trump: The Builder North Carolina Needs</h3>\n<p>As the conversation with Harnwell unfolded, the discussion turned to leadership. Engelbrecht made it clear that North Carolina deserves leaders who prioritize rebuilding and recovery. Enter President Trump. Known as a builder, Trump has a track record of revitalizing struggling communities and delivering practical solutions. Engelbrecht pointed out that under stronger leadership, delays in aid and services wouldn’t be the norm.</p>\n<p>\"If the ballots had been damaged, how would they make up the time?” she asked, highlighting the ongoing incompetence that has plagued the state’s response efforts. This November, voters have a chance to choose a leader who understands infrastructure and logistics. As Trump has often said, “I build things,” and that’s exactly what North Carolina needs.</p>\n<h3>True the Vote: Keeping Elections Fair</h3>\n<p>Engelbrecht’s organization, True the Vote, is on the ground to ensure election integrity, and her team is monitoring the situation closely. \"We’re here to help shore up the process,” she said, pointing to her team’s work across battleground states like North Carolina, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The message is clear: every vote matters, and voters need to make their voices heard to avoid a repeat of the current mess.</p>\n<h3>This November, Your Vote Can Bring Real Change</h3>\n<p>Voters in North Carolina have the power to demand better leadership. Engelbrecht’s insights should serve as a wake-up call for anyone left behind during recent disasters. Don’t wait for the next storm to hit—vote for leaders who will deliver real aid, real solutions, and real results.</p>\n<p><strong>More about North Carolina: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/election-integrity-push-targets-north-carolina-and-eight-other-states-in-voter-registration-legal-battle/\">Election Integrity Push Targets North Carolina and Eight Other States in Voter Registration Legal Battle</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/still-time-to-fight-north-carolina-voter-casts-six-ballots-top-strategies-to-combat-voter-fraud-nationwide/\">Still Time to Fight!

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>Grassroots movements are crucial for winning elections, as demonstrated by their historical success for Democrats and the Trump campaign in 2016. As the 2024 election approaches, Trump and his allies emphasize the need for local engagement to drive voter turnout and reclaim political power. Caroline Wren joined the Monday WarRoom to give some details of how Election 2024 is going so far. </strong></p>\n<h3>The Power of Grassroots Movements</h3>\n<p>Grassroots efforts have consistently played a pivotal role in shaping American elections. From the civil rights movement to the recent successes of Democrats, local engagement is key to mobilizing support and driving voter turnout.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Donald Trump’s campaign harnessed the power of grassroots activism to rally a diverse coalition of voters. His ability to connect with everyday Americans, fueled by a robust ground game, propelled him to victory against the odds. As Caroline Wren noted on \"War Room,” \"Grassroots efforts are essential. We need to get involved and fight for our future.”</p>\n<h3>The Current Landscape: Arizona as a Case Study</h3>\n<p>In Monday’s conversation, Wren pointed out the concerning state of voter registration in Arizona. \"There are 218,000 unconfirmed U.S. citizens on the voter rolls,” she revealed. This raises questions about election integrity and highlights the importance of local vigilance.</p>\n<p>Wren expressed frustration over the lack of legal representation for the Arizona Republican Party, emphasizing that without action, the party risks losing ground. \"We need to hold our leaders accountable,” she urged, underscoring the urgency of grassroots involvement.</p>\n<h3>Economic Inequality and Political Disconnection</h3>\n<p>Dave Brat, also on \"War Room,” discussed the broader economic implications of grassroots movements. He stated, \"The top 10 percent own 90 percent of the stocks.” This stark inequality contributes to a growing disconnection between the elite and the average American.</p>\n<p>Brat’s remarks highlight a significant concern: as the wealth gap widens, grassroots movements are more important than ever. They serve as a counterbalance to elite influence in politics, empowering everyday citizens to reclaim their voice.</p>\n<h3>Campaign Financing and Corporate Influence</h3>\n<p>Wren also addressed the impact of corporate financing on elections, stating, \"Our members of Congress are so controlled by the money.” This financial stranglehold makes it critical for grassroots movements to mobilize support at the local level.</p>\n<p>Campaign financing often skews political priorities, making it essential for voters to engage and advocate for their interests. Local efforts can help counter corporate influence and ensure that elected officials are held accountable.</p>\n<h3>The Path Forward: Mobilizing Grassroots Support</h3>\n<p>As the 2024 election looms, Trump and his allies call for renewed grassroots engagement. The mantra is clear: \"Get involved. Register to vote. Make your voice heard.”</p>\n<p>Grassroots movements have historically succeeded because they resonate with the electorate’s frustrations and aspirations. Trump’s campaign is leveraging this strategy, encouraging supporters to participate actively in their communities and advocate for their beliefs.</p>\n<h3>A Call to Activism</h3>\n<p>The upcoming elections present a critical opportunity for grassroots movements to shape the political landscape. By engaging locally, citizens can hold their leaders accountable and advocate for a future that aligns with their values.</p>\n<p>As Wren aptly stated, \"We must fight for our future.” The success of the 2024 elections hinges on grassroots efforts that connect with voters and inspire action. Now is the time for Americans to rise and reclaim their power through local engagement and activism.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/\">Trump Force 47</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/\">Swamp the Vote</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tpusa.com/careers/\">Turning Point Action</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/got-a-min-to-spare-one-month-to-go-warrooms-final-push-for-america-first-victory-in-nov-election/\">Got a Min to Spare?

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>According to economic experts, The Biden-Harris administration’s economic policies have eroded the value of the US dollar by 20% since 2020. This inflation crisis directly impacts voters’ wallets, wages, and savings, making it a pivotal issue for the November election. Voters must take this seriously in November.</strong></p>\n<h3>Inflation Has Eaten Away at the Dollar</h3>\n<p>On Monday, EJ Antoni appeared on the WarRoom program and emphasized a critical point: \"The dollar has lost a fifth of its value since Biden-Harris took office.” This shocking 20% loss is directly tied to the administration’s reckless fiscal policies, including multi-trillion-dollar deficits and unchecked government spending.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-inflation/\">Inflation</a> has hit American households hard. Groceries, gas, rent—all have become more expensive, eroding the dollar’s purchasing power. According to Antoni, even the government’s metrics, which understate inflation, show a significant decline in the dollar’s value. \"This is where the government has gotten all the money to pay for its runaway spending,” Antoni explained. Inflation acts as a hidden tax, and voters are paying the price.</p>\n<h3>Voters Are Feeling the Pinch</h3>\n<p>Why does this matter for voters heading to the polls in November? The value of your wages, savings, and investments has been slashed. As inflation continues to rise, everyday necessities are becoming increasingly unaffordable. Many Americans are left wondering how they’ll maintain their standard of living if the dollar keeps losing value.</p>\n<p>The erosion of the dollar is not just an abstract economic concept—it’s a kitchen table issue. Families struggle with higher costs while their incomes fail to keep pace. \"We are all demonstrably poorer because of the policies of this administration,” Antoni stated. This growing financial strain has voters reconsidering their political choices.</p>\n<h3>Harris’s Policies Are Driving Economic Pain</h3>\n<p>The root cause of this crisis? The Biden-Harris administration’s fiscal irresponsibility. The two-plus trillion-dollar deficits each year are driving inflation and devaluing the dollar. \"Biden and Harris are running $2 trillion deficits right now,” Bannon noted. The government’s excessive borrowing and spending are unsustainable and detrimental to Americans’ financial well-being.</p>\n<p>Adding to this, the job market is suffering. Many of the jobs created during Harris’s term have gone to illegal workers or are part-time positions. Antoni pointed out that “all net job growth since before the pandemic has gone to illegal workers,” leaving many Americans sidelined in the job market. This further exacerbates the economic pain felt by working-class families.</p>\n<h3>What Voters Should Consider in November</h3>\n<p>As voters head to the polls, they should reflect on the past four years of economic hardship. Inflation, wage stagnation, and a weakened dollar are all the direct results of misguided fiscal policies. The erosion of the US dollar means that voters’ wages and savings are worth less now than before Harris took office.</p>\n<p>This is a critical issue for voters to consider in November. The question is simple: Can you afford another four years of policies that are shrinking your paycheck and making it harder to make ends meet?</p>\n<p>In a nation built on financial freedom and opportunity, the dollar’s loss of value threatens the core of the American Dream.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2020#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20dollar%20has%20lost%2018%\">Easy to use Inflation Calculator Website</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more  of our coverage of EJ Antoni: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/big-government-big-problems-ej-antoni-reducing-government-size-is-vital-for-americas-future/\">Big Government, Big Problems: EJ Antoni, ‘Reducing Government Size is Vital for America’s Future’</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/taking-back-american-jobs-how-to-fight-back-against-illegal-immigration-and-economic-decline/\">Taking Back American Jobs: How to Fight Back Against Illegal Immigration and Economic Decline</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/warroom-leads-in-warning-against-kamala-harriss-third-world-policy-tactics-and-labor-neglect-that-ends-in-slavery/\">WarRoom Leads in Warning Against Kamala Harris’s Third World Policy Tactics and Labor Neglect that ends in Slavery</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more context to his Monday comments, watch this entire WarRoom segment:</strong></p>\n<h1>BOMBSHELL: E.J.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>According to Brian Kennedy from the Present Danger China organization, the U.S. faces growing threats from Iran and China, which are undermining its global deterrence. He explained on Wednesday’s WarRoom program that voters must be aware of the implications as the 2024 election nears and said that grassroots mobilization is crucial to influencing the future of U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<h3>U.S. Policies Fuel Global Instability</h3>\n<p>Kennedy warns that current U.S. policies are contributing to global chaos, especially concerning Iran’s aggressions towards Israel. He states, \"The United States is helping underwrite the attack on Israel,” pointing out that American funding to Iran indirectly supports these hostilities. This, he argues, isn’t simply a regional issue but part of a broader global challenge that voters must recognize. U.S. leadership, he asserts, is not taking sufficient action to deter Iran, and this failure could have catastrophic consequences.</p>\n<h3>Failed Deterrence Weakens U.S. Global Standing</h3>\n<p>Kennedy emphasizes that the erosion of U.S. deterrence is not limited to the Middle East. He highlights a troubling trend where adversaries, particularly China, do not respect America’s warnings. \"Iran does not respect the United States, and neither does China,” he says, underscoring how both countries continue to pursue aggressive policies despite U.S. opposition. This is a direct result of weak leadership, Kennedy argues, leaving the U.S. in a vulnerable position.</p>\n<h3>World War III Looms as Real Threat</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most alarming of Kennedy’s warnings is his belief that the world is inching closer to a global conflict. He suggests that the U.S.’s inability to prevent Iran’s provocations could spark a larger confrontation. “This October surprise really could be the start of World War III,” Kennedy cautions. With tensions escalating, particularly in the Middle East, the U.S. may soon face difficult decisions regarding its involvement in new conflicts. Voters need to understand the gravity of the situation as they head to the polls.</p>\n<h3>Domestic Unrest Could Escalate</h3>\n<p>Kennedy also connects international instability to potential domestic unrest. If U.S. policies lead to increased violence in the Middle East, he warns that it could trigger significant disruptions at home. “Palestinian sympathizers and Iranians in the U.S. could create the kind of street violence we saw in 2020,” Kennedy explains. The implications for national security are significant, as instability abroad could spill over into the U.S., complicating an already fraught political landscape.</p>\n<h3>Grassroots Mobilization Is Essential</h3>\n<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Kennedy stresses the importance of voter engagement, especially among supporters of former President Donald Trump. He reveals a startling statistic: many Trump supporters are not even registered to vote. “People donate money to President Trump and are not registered to vote,” he states, highlighting the disconnect between political support and electoral participation. He urges voters to mobilize their communities, saying, “This will be fixed by the WarRoom Posse animating family, friends, and neighbors.”</p>\n<h3>Why This Matters Now</h3>\n<p>Kennedy’s insights underscore the urgent need for American voters to consider the broader implications of U.S. foreign policy. With the U.S.’s global standing weakening and adversaries growing bolder, the stakes for the 2024 election are incredibly high. Weak deterrence, escalating global conflicts, and potential domestic unrest all hinge on the decisions voters make in the coming months.</p>\n<h3> 2024 Election Is a Crucial Turning Point</h3>\n<p>Kennedy’s message is clear: the future of U.S. leadership and world stability rests on the outcome of the 2024 election. Voters must take action, not only by voting themselves but by ensuring their communities are engaged. The risks of failing to act—both globally and domestically—are too great to ignore. This is a critical moment in history, and the choices made in the voting booth will determine whether the U.S. can reclaim its position as a global leader.</p>\n<p>The time to act is now, Kennedy told WarRoom host Ben Harnwell.</p>\n<p>For more of WarRoom’s coverage of the global threats we face:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/global-communism-in-race-against-time-chinas-unrestricted-warfare-is-a-six-month-race-to-taiwan/\">Global Communism in Race Against Time: China’s Unrestricted Warfare is a Six-Month Race to Taiwan</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/a-world-on-edge-face-of-rising-threats-warroom-experts-sound-the-alarm-on-u-s-strategic-withdrawals/\">A WORLD ON EDGE: Face of Rising Threats, WarRoom Experts Sound the Alarm on U.S. Strategic Withdrawals</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/full-on-leadership-crisis-how-taiwans-defense-shortcomings-demand-swift-action-from-global-leaders/\">Full On Leadership Crisis: How Taiwan’s Defense Shortcomings Demand Swift Action from Global Leaders</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full Wednesday interview from the Warroom:</p>\n<h1>Brian Kennedy: Spending Against American Sovereignty And Making Us America Last</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Ryan Walters, <a href=\"https://sde.ok.gov/superintendent-public-instruction-ryan-walters#:~:text=The%20Oklahoma%20State%20Department%20of%20Education\">Oklahoma’s state superintendent of education</a>, appeared on Tuesday WarRoom, and talked about spearheading a groundbreaking initiative to distribute Bibles to every classroom in the state. His efforts not only aim to revitalize the teaching of American history but also seek to inspire similar initiatives nationwide, echoing support from influential figures like President Trump. Walters emphasizes the need for educational reform to combat leftist ideologies infiltrating schools, aiming to restore traditional values and a true understanding of America’s past.</p>\n<h3>A Vision for Educational Reform</h3>\n<p>Ryan Walters is determined to reshape Oklahoma’s educational landscape by ensuring every classroom has a copy of the Bible. In a recent discussion, he stated, \"We allocated $3 million here in the state to make sure every single classroom has a copy of the Bible.” This initiative is not just about distributing books; it’s a strategic move to reinforce the historical significance of the Bible in American culture. Walters insists that students need to \"understand the role the Bible played in American history” to grasp what makes the nation great.</p>\n<h3>Overcoming Opposition</h3>\n<p>Walters has faced considerable opposition from various quarters, including teachers’ unions and radical leftist groups. He remarked, \"The teachers unions have fought us; the radical Marxist Democrats have funds, but it’s going to happen.” Despite these challenges, he remains steadfast in his mission, driven by the support he receives from parents and community members who want to counter what he describes as \"left-wing indoctrination in the classroom.”</p>\n<p>According to Walters, this fight is not just localized to Oklahoma but is a broader battle against a leftist agenda that seeks to distort American history and values. He argues, \"If you’re not facing stark opposition to what you’re doing, you’re not doing enough.” By taking a stand, Walters believes he is pushing back against a concerted effort to undermine American principles in education.</p>\n<h3>Inspiring National Change</h3>\n<p>Walters is confident that Oklahoma’s initiative will serve as a model for other states. He asserts, \"We are going to be so proud here… to be the first state in the country to bring the Bible back to every single classroom.” His ambition is to encourage other states to adopt similar policies, creating a ripple effect across the nation. \"Every state should be doing this,” he stated, underscoring the need for a collective movement to reclaim educational values.</p>\n<p>Support from President Trump has further amplified Walters’ efforts. He noted that Trump has praised their initiative, which aligns with the former president’s broader goals of restoring traditional educational values. With Trump’s backing, Walters believes their project will gain traction, positioning Oklahoma at the forefront of a national educational reform movement.</p>\n<h3>The Fight Against Leftist Ideologies</h3>\n<p>Walters is adamant about the ideological battles currently playing out in schools. He argued, \"The Democrats have pushed graphic pornography on your kids. They have told your kids that there are different genders.” He believes that the left’s agenda is fundamentally at odds with the values that he and many Oklahomans hold dear. By reintroducing the Bible into schools, Walters aims to counteract this perceived moral decay, emphasizing the need for students to \"understand America’s greatness.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, he is vocal about the urgency of this initiative, especially in light of upcoming elections. \"We have to get that done,” Walters insisted, indicating that the current political climate presents a unique opportunity to enact meaningful change. He views his efforts as part of a larger fight against what he describes as a \"Marxist dumpster fire” threatening the nation’s core values.</p>\n<h3>Return to the Bible</h3>\n<p>Ryan Walters’ initiative to put Bibles in Oklahoma classrooms represents a bold step toward reclaiming educational standards and values. With significant financial backing and a commitment to overcoming opposition, Walters aims to inspire other states to follow suit. His collaboration with President Trump amplifies the significance of this movement, marking it as a pivotal moment in the fight against leftist ideologies in American education. As Walters passionately stated, \"We will not back down to the woke mob,” signaling a determined effort to restore what he believes is a crucial part of America’s heritage.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch Tuesday’s full interview with Ryan Walters:</p>\n<h1>Ryan Walters: “We’re Not Going To Allow Them To Turn This Country Into A Marxist Dumpster Fire.”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Defending American Democracy</h4>\n<p>Mike Davis appeared on Bannon’s WarRoom on Monday to discuss his support of the SAVE Act, which seeks to safeguard American elections by mandating proof of citizenship for voter registration. As illegal voting remains a contentious issue, organizations like the Article III Project are actively campaigning to raise awareness about the serious consequences of illegal voting through targeted advertisements. With a potential 20 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. and allegations of widespread non-citizen voting, the urgency for legislative action is paramount, according to Davis.</p>\n<p>The integrity of U.S. elections is under scrutiny, and Davis, a prominent legal advocate and founder of the Article III Project, is at the forefront of the fight for election integrity. On Monday, Davis discussed the implications of the SAVE Act, which requires proof of citizenship to register to vote. <strong>He stated, “It is illegal to vote in federal elections if you are a non-citizen; it is almost always a federal crime.” </strong></p>\n<p>This crucial legislation ensures that only eligible voters participate in the electoral process, thereby preserving the sanctity of American democracy.</p>\n<h4>We Know Non-Citizens are Voting</h4>\n<p>Davis’s comments come from alarming reports highlighting non-citizen voting in key states. He pointed out that recent findings from Virginia and Texas revealed that thousands of non-citizens had been found on voter rolls, raising serious questions about the electoral process. He explained, “Governor Glenn Youngkin has discovered 6,000 non-citizens voting illegally in Virginia, while Governor Greg Abbott has identified 2,000 non-citizens in Texas. This is not just a coincidence; it’s a trend we need to address.”</p>\n<h4>Article Three Project’s Ad for Spanish-Speaking Potential Voters</h4>\n<p>To combat the threat of illegal voting, the Article III Project has launched a nationwide advertising campaign to educate the public about the potential consequences of participating in elections as a non-citizen. Davis noted the significance of these ads, stating, “We have put out a 30-second public service announcement in Spanish to convey the message that it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections.” This strategic move aims to reach both English and Spanish-speaking audiences, ensuring that the message resonates with a broader demographic.</p>\n<p>The ad campaign serves not only to inform but also to deter non-citizens from voting. Davis elaborated, “We want to make it clear that illegal voting can lead to serious repercussions, including deportation.” By raising awareness about the legal ramifications of illegal voting, the Article III Project seeks to dissuade non-citizens from participating in the electoral process and encourage compliance with existing laws.</p>\n<p>Davis also highlighted the resistance faced by the SAVE Act from Democratic lawmakers. He stated, \"The Democrats argue that we don’t need the SAVE Act because it’s already illegal for non-citizens to vote. Yet, they continue to ignore the evidence that non-citizens are voting.” This statement underscores the ongoing partisan divide regarding election integrity and the necessity for stricter measures to prevent illegal voting.</p>\n<h4>Urgent Call to Action</h4>\n<p>The broader context of immigration policy and voting rights amplifies the urgency for the SAVE Act. With millions of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, ensuring that only citizens can vote has become a pressing issue. Davis articulated the stakes, saying, “With the Biden administration allowing nearly 20 million illegal immigrants into the country, the risk of compromised elections grows by the day.” He stressed that maintaining election integrity is vital for democracy, particularly as swing states become battlegrounds for both political parties.</p>\n<p>In light of these challenges, Davis urged Americans to take action. He encouraged viewers to visit the Article III Project’s website to find resources to get involved in advocacy efforts for the SAVE Act and election integrity initiatives. “You can take action to ensure that our next election is not rigged and stolen. Every American should be concerned about this issue,” he asserted.</p>\n<h4>Illegals Could Sway the Election</h4>\n<p>As the 2024 elections approach, the conversation surrounding illegal voting and election integrity is more critical than ever. The SAVE Act represents a proactive step towards ensuring that U.S. elections are fair, transparent, and secure. By educating the public through strategic campaigns and advocating for necessary legislation, advocates like Mike Davis are fighting to protect democracy and uphold the rule of law.</p>\n<p>For more context and to see the Article 3 project ad, watch this full segment:</p>\n<h1>Mike Davis Offers PSA To Illegal Immigrants | All Illegal Voting Will Be Prosecuted</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Caroline Wren Warns: \"We Lose the Senate, We Lose the Country”—Key 2024 Senate Races Crucial for Trump’s Agenda</h4>\n<p>As the 2024 elections approach, Caroline Wren delivers a stark warning about the consequences if Republicans fail to secure both the presidency and key Senate seats. Speaking with Kash Patel on War Room, Wren emphasized that the outcome of these races could reshape the nation’s future. With polls tightening and stakes higher than ever, she urged voters to understand the gravity of the upcoming election cycle.</p>\n<h4>The 2024 Senate Battle: High Stakes for America’s Future</h4>\n<p>In the run-up to the 2024 election, Caroline Wren identified a critical issue: the survival of Donald Trump’s America First agenda hinges on winning several tight Senate races. She highlighted how closely these races are tied to Trump’s fate, pointing out, \"In 68 out of 69 Senate races, Trump and the Republican Senate candidate either won or lost together.” Wren warned that if Republicans fail to secure both the presidency and Senate control, Democrats will enact sweeping changes that will permanently alter the political landscape.</p>\n<h4>Polling is Misleading—Trump’s Support is Stronger Than It Appears</h4>\n<p>Wren addressed growing concerns among conservatives over polling data showing tight races and potential losses for Trump-backed candidates. \"I keep getting calls from people panicked looking at the polling,” she said. However, Wren reassured supporters that these numbers fail to capture the full picture. Many Trump supporters do not trust pollsters or the media and therefore refuse to participate in surveys. \"Polling has dramatically underestimated Trump’s support,” Wren explained, underscoring that in 2016 and 2020, Trump was similarly underestimated yet pulled off victories in key swing states.</p>\n<h4>2024 Senate Races: A Must-Win for Republicans</h4>\n<p>Wren stressed the importance of key Senate races, particularly in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona. \"If we don’t win these swing states, we could be looking at the end of our ability to win future elections,” she cautioned. Wren pointed out that these Senate seats are not just important for control of the chamber, but for ensuring that Trump’s legislative and judicial appointments can proceed unimpeded. She emphasized, \"We need 52, 53, or even 54 seats to ensure Trump’s cabinet members are confirmed and to enact his agenda.”</p>\n<h4>The Threat of a Democrat-Controlled Senate: Legalizing Millions and Reshaping the Supreme Court</h4>\n<p>The consequences of losing these Senate races, according to Wren, would be devastating for Republicans and for the future of the country. Should Democrats win, they will waste no time in enacting radical changes. Wren outlined three major threats: \"They will immediately lift the filibuster, legalize 30 million illegal citizens who will become forever voters, and pack the Supreme Court.” These steps, she warned, would lead to a permanent Democrat majority and reshape the country in ways that would be impossible to reverse. \"You will never recognize our country again,” Wren declared.</p>\n<p>Wren also highlighted the threat of statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, which would add four permanent liberal senators. \"That is game, set, match right there,” she warned. This would make it nearly impossible for Republicans to regain control of the Senate, cementing Democratic control over key institutions.</p>\n<h4>Arizona and Nevada: Critical Battlegrounds for Trump and Down-Ballot Republicans</h4>\n<p>Wren noted that Arizona and Nevada are two of the most critical battlegrounds in 2024. She was particularly optimistic about Trump’s performance in Arizona, despite polls showing some disparities. \"I do think Donald Trump is performing the best in Arizona right now than any of these swing states,” she stated confidently, adding that the success of Trump-backed candidates like Kari Lake will play a crucial role in the overall outcome.</p>\n<p>In Nevada, Wren expressed frustration with polling that shows Senate candidate Sam Brown trailing by significant margins. \"That’s ridiculous,” Wren said, dismissing these numbers as inaccurate. She believes Brown is very much \"in the hunt” and can win if the Trump ticket performs well statewide.</p>\n<h4>Mobilizing Voters: The Key to Victory</h4>\n<p>Caroline Wren’s message to Republicans was clear: voter mobilization is critical. She urged supporters to engage with their communities and make the stakes of the election crystal clear. \"We need to get others out to the polls and convince them why they need to vote for Donald Trump and their Senate candidates,” she said. Wren stressed the importance of focusing on what happens if Republicans lose. \"If we do not win these swing states, and God forbid, Donald Trump loses… you will never recognize our country again,” she warned.</p>\n<p>Wren reminded listeners that time is running out and every vote matters. The future of the country is at stake, and this election will determine whether America continues on the path of conservative values or succumbs to a liberal agenda that could reshape the nation forever.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Caroline Wren on Monday’s WarRoom program:</p>\n<h1>Caroline Wren Foresees Massive Senate Victories, Identifies Must-Win Races</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Journalist <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-President-Trump-Social-Republic/dp/1641774576#:~:text=In%20Disappearing%20the%20President,%20New%20York\">Lee Smith</a> appeared on Monday’s WarRoom and highlighted the profound implications of former President Barack Obama’s administration, asserting that it continues to shape U.S. politics today. He identifies Obama as the architect behind a shadow network influencing current political narratives and actions against Donald Trump and his supporters. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for Americans navigating the complexities of national security and political accountability.</p>\n<h4>The Legacy of Barack H. Obama</h4>\n<p>Smith’s commentary underscores the importance of examining Barack Obama’s presidency, not just as a historical footnote, but as a significant force in shaping contemporary politics. \"What I’ve done is identify and amass evidence showing that the person who’s been driving this campaign… is Barack Obama,” Smith asserted. This perspective challenges the notion of a faceless \"deep state,” presenting Obama as a central figure orchestrating efforts against his political opponents, particularly Donald Trump.</p>\n<h4>Obama’s Shadow Network</h4>\n<p>Smith posits that Obama’s influence extends beyond mere policy decisions; it manifests in a comprehensive \"shadow network” that involves intelligence figures and legal operatives working to undermine Trump and his allies. According to Smith, this network employs tactics that manipulate public perception and maintain control over political discourse. He noted, \"It’s not just a deep state; it’s not an abstraction… It’s Barack Obama at the head of what I describe as a shadow network.” This assertion calls for a critical examination of the systemic forces at play in American politics today.</p>\n<h4>Consequences of Obama’s Presidency</h4>\n<p>The ramifications of Obama’s presidency are multifaceted, impacting national security, diplomatic relations, and the integrity of democratic processes. Smith’s claims about Robert Malley, a former Iran envoy under Obama, illustrate these consequences. Malley is accused of mishandling sensitive information that could compromise national security, raising concerns about the current administration’s commitment to transparency and accountability. Smith stated, \"What Mali actually did… seems that he put classified information from classified electronic devices over to personal devices.” This mishandling reflects a broader pattern of negligence that can be traced back to policies established during Obama’s tenure.</p>\n<h4>Implications for National Security</h4>\n<p>Understanding the implications of Obama’s presidency is particularly vital in the context of national security. Smith argues that the Obama administration’s approach towards Iran, characterized by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), aimed to legitimize Iran’s nuclear ambitions rather than prevent them. He stated, \"It was never designed to stop Iran from getting a bomb. The purpose was to legalize it.” This failure to effectively counter threats from Iran and its proxies has ongoing consequences for both U.S. interests and global stability.</p>\n<h4>The Fight for Political Accountability</h4>\n<p>The revelations put forth by Smith emphasize the need for political accountability and transparency in the U.S. government. As Smith prepares to release his upcoming book, Disappearing the President: Trump, the Fight for the Republic, he aims to shed light on the systematic targeting of Trump and his supporters by a network that stretches back to Obama’s presidency. \"It’s amazing the way he’s strong-armed big tech into going after his political opponents,” Smith elaborated, indicating the lengths this shadow network has gone to stifle dissent.</p>\n<h4>Moving Forward: Understanding the Legacy</h4>\n<p>As America approaches critical elections, understanding the consequences of Obama’s presidency becomes increasingly essential. Past actions and policies shape the dynamics of power, influence, and accountability in politics, making it vital for citizens to engage with this history. Smith’s insights remind us that the impact of Obama’s presidency is not confined to the past; it continues to influence the present political landscape.</p>\n<p>Lee Smith’s analysis of Barack H. Obama’s enduring impact reveals a complex interplay of power and influence that shapes contemporary American politics. By identifying Obama as the leader of a shadow network that undermines political accountability, Smith calls attention to scrutinizing past administrations to understand current challenges. As the nation navigates these turbulent waters, the legacy of Obama remains a critical factor in shaping America’s political future. Understanding this legacy empowers citizens to advocate for transparency and integrity in their government, ensuring that the lessons of the past are not forgotten.</p>\n<p>More from the WarRoom on this topic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/steve-bannon-vs-lois-lerner-unpacking-the-double-standards-of-justice-under-obama-2/\">Steve Bannon vs. Lois Lerner: Unpacking the Double Standards of Justice Under Obama</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/deep-state-intrigue-unveiled-monica-crowley-exposes-obamas-maneuvers-in-trumps-early-days-joined-by-kash-patels-stark-warning/\">Deep State Intrigue Unveiled: Monica Crowley Exposes Obama’s Maneuvers in Trump’s Early Days, Joined by Kash Patel’s Stark Warning</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/out-democratic-chaos-exposed-in-revelatory-warroom-exchange-prediction-obama-led-intervention-to-oust-biden/\">OUT!

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Stop ‘Wokeism’ with Faith</h4>\n<p>Despite 80% of Americans identifying as Christians, a shocking disconnect exists between faith and civic engagement, as evidenced by alarming trends in voter turnout and moral beliefs. David Barton and Bill Federer appeared on the WarRoom on Thursday to urge church leaders and congregants to rise against the tide of secularism and reclaim the nation through informed voting and active participation in societal issues.</p>\n<h4>A Disturbing Disconnect Between Faith and Action</h4>\n<p>In a recent panel discussion, David Barton, Bill Federer, and Dave Brat confronted the stark reality facing American Christians today. Barton highlighted a significant paradox: \"You have 80% of the United States identifying as Christians, and yet we have a woke weaponized $7 trillion budget and a border invasion. The nation is under attack.” This alarming situation begs the question: why are Christians not translating their faith into action?</p>\n<p>Barton pointed to the troubling trends revealed in two national polls, which indicated a steep decline in the voting engagement of professing Christians. Historically, this demographic has been one of the most reliable voting blocs, with 99% turnout in 2016. Yet, the current projected turnout for active church-going Christians sits at a staggering 41% who are not planning to vote in the upcoming elections. \"That’s only 59% that will vote, and this is a constituency where Trump held a much higher number in previous elections,” Barton noted, expressing his concern over this disengagement.</p>\n<h4>The Crisis of Moral Clarity</h4>\n<p>The panelists also discussed the alarming shift in the moral landscape among church-going Christians. Barton revealed, \"56% of church-going Christians say there are no absolute rights and wrongs. No moral truths.” This shift raises critical questions about the foundational beliefs that underpin Christianity. Incredibly, 42% of these Christians support abortion under all circumstances, and 30% favor socialism over capitalism—positions that starkly contrast with traditional Christian doctrine.</p>\n<p>\"It’s a very disturbing picture,” Barton stated, emphasizing the need for a revival of moral clarity among believers. This crisis of values can no longer be ignored, especially when many Christians are basing their voting decisions on factors that have little to do with their faith.</p>\n<h4>The Role of Pastors in Mobilization</h4>\n<p>One significant aspect of this discussion was the call to action directed at pastors and church leaders. Both Barton and Federer emphasized the vital role that church leaders must play in encouraging their congregations to engage in the political process. \"19% of these folks say they’re more likely to vote if they hear something from the pulpit,” said Barton. \"If pastors would talk about these issues and encourage their congregations to vote, we could see a dramatic increase in voter turnout.”</p>\n<p>However, the statistics are sobering; only 2.8% of pastors address the pressing societal issues currently affecting the nation from the pulpit. This silence contributes to a culture of apathy and disengagement among Christians, allowing moral decay to flourish unchecked.</p>\n<h4>Accountability to God</h4>\n<p>The conversation took a poignant turn as Barton reminded listeners of their accountability to God. \"Someday, you will stand before Him and be asked, ‘What did you do with the country I gave you?’” he warned. \"Saying ‘I didn’t like any of the candidates’ is not going to be a good answer.” This powerful reminder serves as a rallying cry for Christians to take their civic responsibilities seriously and act in alignment with their beliefs.</p>\n<h4>A Call for Awakening</h4>\n<p>As the discussion concluded, it was evident that the stakes have never been higher for American Christians. The combined effects of political apathy and moral confusion present a formidable challenge to the future of the nation. Yet, as Barton and Federer emphasized, there is still hope. \"If we give them the right call, we can get a response,” Barton asserted, encouraging believers to step forward and reclaim their voice in the public square.</p>\n<p>In a time when faith and action seem worlds apart, the clarion call is clear: Christians must awaken from their slumber, engage in the political process, and re-establish the moral foundations upon which this nation was built. The future of America may very well depend on it.</p>\n<p>To hear more, watch these Thursday WarRoom segments:</p>\n<h1>David Barton Calls Out Pastors And Priests To GOTV This November, Securing Our Christian Values</h1>\n<h1>William Federer: Christians Should Display Their Beliefs Through Their Vote</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Richard Barris Critiques Defeatism in Political Polling</h4>\n<p><strong>“With all these stories of cheating, people are saying they won’t vote because their votes doesn’t count.  That is wrong. Your vote does count,” Barris told Peter Navarro.</strong></p>\n<p>Richard Barris appeared on Monday’s WarRoom and challenged the narrative of defeatism in political polling, particularly regarding Kamala Harris and her perceived underdog status. He argues that the media’s portrayal of Harris as a frontrunner is misleading and undermines genuine voter sentiment. Barris asserts that many Americans recognize the reality of the political landscape and are beginning to lean toward Donald Trump despite previous hesitations.</p>\n<h4>Media Influence and Polling Perception</h4>\n<p>Richard Barris highlights the media’s significant role in shaping public perception of political candidates. He argues that the current media landscape is heavily biased in favor of Harris, stating, \"The entire world is against Donald Trump.” This statement underscores his belief that major media outlets, from Fox News to MSNBC, are actively promoting Harris while undermining Trump. He further elaborates, \"Everyone… wants Harris to win,” suggesting a concerted effort to create a narrative that does not align with voter sentiment.</p>\n<h4>Misleading Polls and Public Sentiment</h4>\n<p>Barris emphasizes the disconnect between public polls and the true feelings of the electorate. He notes, \"Kamala Harris’s polling does not look rosy for her,” pointing out that the reported numbers do not accurately reflect the mood among voters. Barris argues that many polls lack consensus, misleadingly portraying Harris’s viability as a candidate. He criticizes the notion that Harris can maintain a solid lead against Trump, calling it \"insane” to believe she could outperform Barack Obama in critical states like Pennsylvania.</p>\n<h4>The Reality of Trump’s Support</h4>\n<p>Barris identifies a growing trend among previously reluctant Trump supporters now leaning toward him. He notes, \"There is a fear… among those reluctant Trump supporters,” indicating that their concerns about Harris’s perceived radicalism outweigh their previous apprehensions about Trump’s chaotic style. He refers to these voters as \"seasick voters,” who appreciate Trump’s policies but were initially put off by his demeanor. However, they now recognize Trump’s capabilities, acknowledging, \"They know Trump can do the job,” reinforcing that his track record is beginning to resonate with them.</p>\n<h4>Concerns About Cheating and Defeatism</h4>\n<p>Barris also addresses the issue of electoral integrity, emphasizing that discussions around cheating can foster a sense of defeatism among voters. He argues that when people become overly fixated on allegations of electoral manipulation, it undermines their belief in the democratic process. \"When we talk about cheating, it can lead to hopelessness,” he states, underscoring that this mindset can deter people from voting. Instead of succumbing to this narrative, Barris advocates for proactive engagement, encouraging supporters to maintain faith in the electoral system and to participate actively.</p>\n<h4>Harris’s Missed Opportunities</h4>\n<p>Barris criticizes Harris for failing to effectively communicate her message during debates, stating that she did not spend enough time convincing undecided voters to support her. He asserts, \"They want to know what she is saying that can allow me to put my fate in her hands.” This reflects a broader issue of trust and connection that Harris has yet to establish with potential supporters. Instead of addressing her qualifications and vision, she often resorts to attacking Trump, which Barris argues is counterproductive.</p>\n<h4>The Presidential Bar and Voter Confidence</h4>\n<p>A key point Barris makes is that Harris has not met the \"presidential bar” required to gain voter confidence. He articulates, \"People are still wondering… if she can do this job.” This lack of assurance is a significant hurdle for her campaign. Barris’s assertion that Harris’s recent surge in popularity is a \"media fabrication” further emphasizes his view that the narrative surrounding her is not rooted in reality but rather in favorable coverage and party support.</p>\n<h4>A Call for Realism</h4>\n<p>Barris’s comments reveal a critical perspective on the current political climate. He challenges the defeatism in polling narratives, emphasizing the need for a realistic understanding of voter sentiment. By highlighting the media’s influence, the disconnect between polling data and public opinion, and Harris’s failure to engage with undecided voters, Barris paints a picture of a political landscape where many are beginning to favor Trump. As he states, \"Winners don’t ask for more debates,” suggesting that true confidence comes from a position of strength rather than from seeking validation through repeated contests.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Barris’s message is clear: maintaining engagement, fostering trust in the electoral process, and recognizing the realities of voter sentiment are crucial for success in the current political landscape.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch Richard Barris on Monday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Baris Explains The Lack Of Trust The American People Have In Kamala</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Time is Running Out: Why American Voters Need Steve Bannon Now More Than Ever</h4>\n<p>The American public is clamoring for clarity as the nation stands on the edge of a potential government shutdown, with less than 50 days until the critical November 5 election. Steve Bannon, a leading populist voice, is uniquely positioned to provide that insight. However, he is serving the final month of his sentence in a federal correctional facility for defying a Congressional subpoena; Bannon remains one of the few figures capable of cutting through the political noise.</p>\n<p>With the SAVE Act gridlocked in the Senate and a government funding crisis looming on September 30, the stakes couldn’t be higher. In this pivotal moment, Bannon’s insights on Washington’s dysfunctional inner workings are essential to understanding the larger battle that is unfolding.</p>\n<h4>McConnell’s Focus on Tax Hikes and Military Spending, Ignoring National Security Threats</h4>\n<p>In an exclusive report by The Daily Signal, the troubling disconnect between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s priorities and the nation’s urgent issues was laid bare. While House Republicans scramble to pass a continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown and push forward the SAVE Act, McConnell instead spent the Senate GOP’s weekly luncheon discussing tax hikes to boost Pentagon funding.</p>\n<p>At a time when two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump have shaken the political landscape, McConnell’s tone-deaf response has angered many within his party. Rather than addressing these pressing threats, McConnell chose to focus on raising taxes, a move that runs counter to the Republican platform and Trump’s economic policies.</p>\n<p>The luncheon discussion revolved around a recent report by the Commission on the National Defense Strategy, which suggested that defense spending increases should be tied to tax hikes. McConnell echoed these sentiments, citing historical tax rates from the Cold War era to justify his position. However, critics argue that increased taxes in today’s political climate would only serve to widen the gap between Washington elites and the American working class.</p>\n<p>This stark contrast between the House’s focus on addressing critical issues and McConnell’s apparent detachment highlights the political dysfunction that voters are desperate to understand.</p>\n<h4>Steve Bannon’s 2023 Warning: A Fight Over Washington’s Outsiders and Donor-Class Elites</h4>\n<p>In a 2023 segment of WarRoom, Steve Bannon’s sharp commentary on the political elite’s hatred for Donald Trump offers a chilling reflection of the current crisis. Bannon explained that Trump’s status as an outsider, and his refusal to be controlled by the donor class, is what made him a target.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"The reason they hate Trump… is that he puts you in the room, at the head of the table. The donor class can’t and will never forgive him for that,” Bannon remarked, in a reaccuring theme for Bannon describing the Power of the MAGA movement. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2016, with help from Bannon,  Trump upended the political order by refusing to rely on big donors. This independence, Bannon argues, gave power back to the people, creating a populist-nationalist movement that the elites couldn’t control.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s analysis goes deeper, touching on the broader financial manipulation in Washington DC. He highlighted the stark contrast between the everyday Americans affected by inflation, high mortgage rates, and economic instability and the elites who manipulate the system to their advantage. This systemic exploitation, Bannon asserts, is why figures like Trump and the populist movement are seen as such a threat.</p>\n<h4>The Intersection of Money, Power, and Washington’s Broken System</h4>\n<p>In his WarRoom commentary, Bannon dissected the \"politics of money,” pointing out that the current economic crises are not inevitable. \"These are not immutable laws of physics,” Bannon noted. \"This is all through human agency in decisions.” He explained that the economic challenges the country faces—inflation, mortgage prices, or reckless spending—result from intentional policies crafted by the elite donor class to protect their interests.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s commentary illuminates the growing frustration among voters who feel shut out of the decision-making process in Washington. He points to the historical concentration of financial power in the hands of a few, tracing it back to the establishment of the Federal Reserve and the introduction of income taxes. Bannon argues that this manipulation of economic systems is at the root of America’s current political and financial crises.</p>\n<h4>America’s Moment of Reckoning: Why Steve Bannon’s Voice Matters Now</h4>\n<p>As Bannon nears the end of his sentence at the end of October, his perspective on the looming government shutdown and the SAVE Act’s uncertain fate in the Senate is more critical than ever. He understands the stakes of this battle—both for the American people and for the future of the populist movement. His warning in 2023 about the elite donor class’s manipulation of Washington’s economic systems rings truer than ever as the nation teeters on the edge of another shutdown.</p>\n<p>The establishment’s failure to address these pressing issues and the donor class’s grip on economic policies are precisely why Bannon’s voice is essential in this moment. The WarRoom is a platform where the political and economic interests that drive Washington can be exposed and dissected. As Americans face a crisis of trust in their leadership, Steve Bannon’s unfiltered analysis is precisely what the country needs to understand the larger forces at play.</p>\n<h4>Steve Bannon’s Return to the WarRoom is Critical for American Voters</h4>\n<p>With a government shutdown looming, a critical election just weeks away, and the SAVE Act stuck in legislative limbo, Steve Bannon’s return to the political stage is pivotal. His insights into Washington’s broken system, the influence of the donor class, and the elite’s disregard for the working class are crucial for voters seeking clarity. As he completes his sentence and resumes his WarRoom platform, Bannon’s analysis will be key to navigating the political and economic storms ahead.</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/09/17/exclusive-mcconnell-focuses-raising-taxes-trump-assassination-attempt-senate-luncheon/\">EXCLUSIVE: McConnell Focuses on Raising Taxes, Not Trump Assassination Attempt, at Senate Luncheon</a></h3>\n<p>For more context, watch this 2023 WarRoom segment featuring Steve Bannon:</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Michele Bachman appeared on Thursday’s WarRoom with warnings of UN threats to US Sovereignty by a UN vote mandating Israel’s withdrawal from key territories and the potential expansion of UN authority through upcoming global agreements. Bachmann argues that these developments significantly threaten national sovereignty and U.S. policy.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“These countries are all run by the billionaire class, right? It’s not just the countries decide to do this stuff. So who’s pulling the strings? And who wants to? Ultimately run the world, why it’s the richest people in the world, the richest corporations in the world, and you have to look no further than the world economic Forum. That’s the crowd. That means in Davos about every six months they offline in in their private jets and decide how we’re going to become slaves to them, “Bachman told WarRoom host, Dave Brat on Thursday. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In response to these threats, Bachmann urged Americans to take action by signing a petition at StopWorldGovernment.org. She believes mobilizing public support and influencing political leaders, including former President Trump, is crucial in countering these globalist initiatives.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Please everyone go to StopWorldGovernment.org,” she implored. \"We need to get this to President Trump so that he can weigh in on this.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Overall, Bachmann’s remarks highlight her concerns about the growing influence of global governance bodies and their potential impact on U.S. sovereignty and international alliances.</p>\n<p><strong>KEY POINTS FROM BACHMAN:</strong></p>\n<p>UN Vote on Israel: Michele Bachmann highlighted a recent United Nations vote that passed with overwhelming support, demanding Israel vacate Judea, Samaria, and parts of Jerusalem within 12 months. \"There was a consequential vote taken yesterday at the United Nations and it passed overwhelmingly,” Bachmann reported. Only 14 countries opposed the measure, signaling broad international backing for the resolution.</p>\n<p>US Influence at the UN: Bachmann emphasized the significant role of the United States in the UN, noting that the U.S. contributes over 25% of the UN’s budget. She argued that the U.S. could use its financial leverage to block unfavorable resolutions. \"The United States is more clout than anyone at the United Nations,” she stated. \"We pay over 25% of all the dues and if we want to, we can shut down any vote at the U.N.”</p>\n<p>Upcoming Global Agreements: Bachmann expressed concern about the \"Summit of the Future” and the \"Pact for the Future,” scheduled to be discussed at the UN. She warned that these agreements would further consolidate global authority under the UN, potentially compromising national sovereignty. \"On Sunday, something very important is going to happen. It is called Summit of the Future,” she explained. The pact aims to enhance the UN Secretary-General’s power over international crises and global governance.</p>\n<p>Impact on US Policy and Israel: The discussion also touched on recent U.S. policy decisions, including Vice President Kamala Harris’s stance on military aid to Israel. Bachmann criticized Harris’s position, stating, \"Kamala Harris just said she is not going to be forgiving ammunition to the Jews.” She framed this as part of a broader pattern of undermining support for Israel amid ongoing conflicts.</p>\n<p>Call to Action: Bachmann urged Americans to sign a petition at<strong>\n<a href=\"https://stopworldgovernment.org/\">StopWorldGovernment.org</a>\n</strong>to oppose the UN’s increasing control over national policies. She also suggested that former President Trump could play a critical role in countering these developments if re-elected. \"Please everyone go to StopWorldGovernment.org,” she urged. \"We need to get this to President Trump so that he can weigh in on this.”</p>\n<p>Bachmann raised the alarms about the significant United Nations vote that demands Israel’s withdrawal from key territories, including Judea, Samaria, and parts of Jerusalem. During her discussion with Brat, Bachmann emphasized that this resolution, which passed overwhelmingly with only 14 countries dissenting, poses a severe threat to Israeli sovereignty and security. She explained that the resolution mandates Israel vacate these areas within 12 months, a move she described as deeply troubling.</p>\n<p>Bachmann also highlighted the substantial influence of the United States within the UN, noting that the U.S. contributes over 25% of the UN’s budget. \"The United States is more clout than anyone at the United Nations,” she stated. Despite this, she warned that without a decisive response, the U.S. could lose its ability to shape UN decisions. Bachmann argued that the U.S. could potentially block such resolutions by leveraging its financial contributions, but this would require a proactive stance.</p>\n<p>Adding to her concerns, Bachmann discussed upcoming global agreements like the \"Summit of the Future” and the \"Pact for the Future,” which are set to expand UN authority. She criticized these agreements for consolidating power within the UN, potentially undermining national sovereignty. \"On Sunday, something very important is going to happen. It is called Summit of the Future,” she said. The pact aims to grant the UN Secretary-General increased control over international crises and global governance, a development she fears will erode national autonomy.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on recent U.S. policy decisions regarding Israel. Bachmann took issue with Vice President Kamala Harris’s statements on military aid to Israel, arguing that Harris’s reluctance to support Israeli defense efforts aligns with a troubling trend of weakening support for the Jewish state. \"Kamala Harris just said she is not going to be forgiving ammunition to the Jews,” she criticized.</p>\n<p>For more watch this segment with Bachman and Brat:</p>\n<h1>Michele Bachmann On WHO’s New Plan To Enact Emergency Powers For Globalists</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>Kamala Harris’s persistent approval struggles have become a significant liability for the Democratic Party. Recent polls reveal that her negative ratings are closely tied to President Joe Biden’s own challenges, raising concerns about the impact on the upcoming elections. </strong></p>\n<h4>Kamala Harris’s Approval Ratings</h4>\n<p>Kamala Harris has consistently struggled with low approval ratings, a trend reflecting broader dissatisfaction with the current administration. Mark Mitchell, from <a href=\"https://www.rasmussenreports.com/\">Rasmussen Reports,</a> said on Tuesday’s WarRoom, \"Kamala Harris has struggled with her approval ratings, consistently finding herself in negative territory. This reflects broader discontent with the administration she represents.” Her unpopularity is not an isolated issue but rather a symptom of the larger dissatisfaction with the Democratic leadership under Biden.</p>\n<h4>Harris’s Connection to Biden’s Policies</h4>\n<p>A crucial factor in Harris’s political difficulties is how she is perceived in relation to President Biden. Many voters, especially Independents and moderates, view Harris as a direct extension of Biden’s policies. Mitchell explains, \"Independents and moderate voters often see Kamala Harris as a direct extension of President Biden’s policies. Her challenges are viewed as reflective of Biden’s broader leadership issues.” This perception complicates Harris’s political standing, as any problems associated with Biden are also attributed to her, diminishing her ability to garner support.</p>\n<h4>Impact on the Democratic Ticket</h4>\n<p>The ramifications of Harris’s unpopularity extend beyond her individual ratings. Her struggles pose a significant issue for the Democratic ticket as a whole. Mitchell points out, \"The unpopularity of Kamala Harris poses a significant problem for the Democratic ticket. Her low ratings and perceived connection to Biden’s presidency could influence the party’s overall electoral prospects.” With Harris’s approval ratings intertwined with Biden’s performance, her difficulties may undermine the party’s efforts to secure electoral victories.</p>\n<h4>Recent Polling Data Insights</h4>\n<p>Recent polling data underscores a shifting political landscape with significant implications for the Democratic Party. According to Gallup, Biden’s approval rating has dropped to 39%, reflecting growing voter dissatisfaction. Mitchell remarks, \"Biden’s approval ratings are suffering, driven by dissatisfaction with economic performance and handling of key issues.”</p>\n<p>In contrast, former President Donald Trump shows strong performance in key battleground states. Polls from Emerson College reveal Trump leading Biden by 4 percentage points in Pennsylvania and by 3 percentage points in Michigan. Mitchell observes, \"Trump’s resurgence in these critical states suggests that his base remains energized and that he may be well-positioned for a comeback.”</p>\n<h4>Shift in Voter Preferences</h4>\n<p>Data from Rasmussen Reports indicate a shift in voter preferences, with more independents and swing voters expressing dissatisfaction with the current administration. Mitchell notes, \"The erosion of support among independents and swing voters is a crucial factor that could influence the outcome of the next election.” Economic concerns, particularly inflation and job growth, drive voter sentiment, with 60% of voters believing current policies fail to address inflation effectively.</p>\n<h4>Impact of Ongoing Investigations</h4>\n<p>Trump’s legal battles and ongoing investigations also affect voter perceptions. Despite controversies, Trump’s substantial poll numbers suggest his base remains loyal. According to Quinnipiac University, 56% of Republican voters view Trump’s legal challenges as politically motivated. Mitchell adds, \"The legal issues surrounding Trump have not significantly diminished his support among his core base, indicating a persistent polarization in voter sentiment.”</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Kamala Harris’s approval issues reflect broader dissatisfaction with the Biden administration, impacting the Democratic Party’s electoral prospects. With Biden’s approval ratings declining and Trump gaining traction in key states, the 2024 presidential race is becoming highly competitive. As voter concerns evolve, the outcome remains uncertain, highlighting the importance of strategic planning and ongoing analysis.</p>\n<p>For more context watch this three part series featuring Mark Mitchell in the WarRoom with Jack Posobiec:</p>\n<h1>Mitchell: “I Can Only Imagine The Harris Campaign Is Praying For An Act Of God Right Now”</h1>\n<h1>Mark Mitchell: “Democrats Are Losing Independents”</h1>\n<h1>Mark Mitchell: “60% Of Voters Say Kamala Is Just More Of The Same”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>Steve Bannon’s persistent push to shut down the U.S. government until the illegal immigration crisis is under control is back in focus as the nation grapples with escalating chaos in towns like Springfield, Ohio. <a href=\"https://x.com/TaylerUSA/status/1833860464629194931\">Reports</a> of illegal immigrants allegedly capturing pets for food have horrified citizens and reignited the urgency of Bannon’s America First agenda. Bannon’s previous call to action, urging Speaker Mike Johnson and the House of Representatives to act, resonates strongly now as he sits imprisoned, unable to personally deliver his message. It’s up to the WarRoom posse to remind the American people: shut down the government, close the border, and elect Trump.</strong></p>\n<h4>The Immigration Crisis: A National Struggle</h4>\n<p>The crisis at the U.S. southern border is at a breaking point, with millions of illegal immigrants flooding into the country under the Biden-Harris administration’s open border policies. This has led to what Steve Bannon and his supporters see as a calculated invasion designed to destabilize the nation’s economy, safety, and cultural integrity. Over nine million illegal immigrants have crossed into the U.S. since President Biden took office, posing significant threats to working-class wages, minority communities, and national security.</p>\n<p>This is no accident, according to Bannon, who believes the globalists—those loyal to Davos and multinational corporations—are engineering this crisis to destroy the very fabric of America. His solution? Immediate mass deportations and a firm shutdown of all government operations until Congress takes control of the borders.</p>\n<h4>Bannon’s Year-Old Warning: Shut It Down</h4>\n<p>In a 2023 speech at Turning Point Action, Bannon made a bold appeal to the House of Representatives, warning that if immigration wasn’t addressed, the government must be shut down. His commentary in the video clip below, referencing videos of President Trump calling for deportations, still rings true today. Bannon emphasized that every one of the nine million illegal immigrants must be deported—not just criminals or those from mental institutions. He argued that mass illegal immigration would crush the wages of African-American and Hispanic communities, leaving the working class without a future.</p>\n<p>“This is treason,” Bannon declared, urging voters to wake up to the severity of the invasion. He also referenced an 85-year-old civil rights leader from Chicago who demanded justice during a public hearing on immigration, highlighting the grassroots outrage across the nation.</p>\n<h4>The Long Road Ahead: Decades of Damage</h4>\n<p>According to Bannon, the damage caused by the Biden administration’s policies will take 30-40 years to repair. His solution is clear: first, bring Trump back to power to secure the borders and withdraw from dangerous international agreements, like those with the United Nations, which support open borders. Only then can the U.S. begin to heal from the harm inflicted by years of globalist-driven chaos.</p>\n<p>In his speech, Bannon stressed that fixing America won’t happen overnight, even under Trump. “Make America Great Again” isn’t a one-term solution. Instead, it will require continuous efforts, with Trump leading the way for successive MAGA presidents. He warned, however, that the road to recovery will be long and grueling, filled with economic challenges exacerbated by reckless spending and weak border policies.</p>\n<h4>The Battle Continues: November Election Looming</h4>\n<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Bannon’s message is more relevant than ever. The illegal immigration crisis has only worsened, and Bannon’s call to shut down the government remains a rallying cry for populists and nationalists alike. With Steve Bannon imprisoned as a political prisoner, his supporters have taken up the mantle to keep his message alive.</p>\n<p>The WarRoom posse knows what Bannon would say today: shut the government down until the border is under control. Elect Trump to lead the charge. This election represents a critical moment in American history, one that could decide the future of the Republic for the next 30-40 years.</p>\n<h4>Bannon’s Vision Lives On</h4>\n<p>Steve Bannon may be behind bars as a political prisoner of the Biden-Harriss weaponized Department of Justice, but his vision for America continues to resonate with millions of citizens who believe that securing the border is the first step to reclaiming the nation’s sovereignty. The fight ahead is tough, but as Bannon emphasized, there is no compromise. Shut down the border or shut down the government and re-elect President Trump and America First candidates all over the country until the Amerian people are safe and free again.</p>\n<p>Resources to defend our national sovereignty and get Trump and other elected, and to contact sitting US reps:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/message-from-steve-bannon-from-prison-mobilize-voters-and-election-workers-to-stop-the-steal/\">Message from Steve Bannon from Prison: ‘Mobilize Voters and Election Workers to Stop the Steal’</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-importance-of-being-heard-warrooms-bill-blaster-empowers-citizens-to-make-an-impact/\">The Importance of Being Heard: WarRoom’s Bill Blaster Empowers Citizens to Make an Impact</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context watch:</p>\n<h1>Bannon Shreds Intentional Destruction Of America With Immigration, Blasts Speaker Johnson’s Inaction</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h2>Key Insights and Actions for Voters Amidst Election Struggles</h2>\n<h3>Background on Election Obstacles and Administrative Overreach</h3>\n<p>Significant challenges have emerged concerning President Trump’s campaign and efforts to restore power to the American people in recent political developments. The latest insights from Brian Costello on Saturday’s WarRoom offer a deeper understanding of these obstacles and how they impact the democratic process. Costello, known for his critical perspectives on the administrative state, sheds light on the various forces that hinder the electoral process and undermine the principles of the WarRoom and Steve Bannon’s reform agenda.</p>\n<h3>Key Issues Highlighted by Brian Costello- Administrative State Resistance</h3>\n<p>Costello points out that the entrenched administrative state poses a major obstacle to President Trump’s efforts to reform Washington. This bureaucracy, resistant to change, uses its influence to block initiatives aimed at reducing government overreach and returning power to the people. Costello emphasizes that this resistance is not just about policy disagreements but a systemic effort to preserve the status quo and resist populist reforms.</p>\n<h3>Legal and Political Obstacles</h3>\n<p>According to Costello, legal battles and politically motivated prosecutions have become tools used by opponents to obstruct Trump’s campaign and undermine his credibility. These challenges are seen as part of a broader strategy to discredit and incapacitate Trump, thereby hindering his ability to mobilize support and drive his agenda forward. The legal landscape is thus shaped by a combination of litigation designed to drain resources and distract from core campaign messages.</p>\n<h3>Media and Narrative Control</h3>\n<p>The media’s role in shaping public perception is another critical issue identified by Costello. He argues that biased media coverage and strategic misinformation contribute to the narrative that undermines Trump’s legitimacy and paints his campaign as illegitimate. This media influence complicates the public’s understanding of the true challenges facing Trump and his efforts to address them.</p>\n<h4>Actions Voters Can Take To Advocate for Change</h4>\n<p><strong>Stay Informed and Engaged</strong>\nVoters should actively seek out reliable and diverse sources of information to understand the full scope of the challenges facing the electoral process. Engaging with multiple viewpoints and critically assessing media narratives can help counteract the effects of misinformation and bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Support Reform Initiatives</strong>\nSupporting initiatives that aim to limit the influence of the administrative state and promote transparency in government can align with the WarRoom’s agenda. Advocates for reform should back legislative efforts and public campaigns that seek to curtail bureaucratic overreach and enhance accountability.</p>\n<p><strong>Advocate for Fair Legal Processes</strong>\nCampaigning for fair and unbiased legal processes is crucial. Voters can support efforts that aim to protect individuals from politically motivated legal actions and ensure that the legal system operates impartially. This includes advocating for judicial reforms that enhance fairness and transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>Engage in Grassroots Mobilization</strong>\nGrassroots activism plays a significant role in countering the administrative state’s resistance and media bias. Voters can get involved in local political organizations, participate in community discussions, and support candidates who prioritize reform and transparency.</p>\n<h4>Don’t Sit This One Out</h4>\n<p>Costello’s insights highlight the multifaceted nature of the obstacles facing President Trump and efforts to restore power to the American people. By understanding these challenges and actively participating in the democratic process, voters can contribute to overcoming the resistance from the administrative state and supporting meaningful reforms. Engaging in informed advocacy and supporting fair legal and electoral practices are crucial steps in addressing these issues and promoting a more accountable and representative government.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this full segment from Saturday’s WarRoom that features Brian Costello:</p>\n<h1>Brian Costello Breaks Down Congressional Debate On Method To Restrict Trade With China</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>Kamala Harris’s new homeowners policy and escalating home prices in key battleground states threaten to deepen American families’ financial struggles. A Saturday WarRoom discussion between Sophia Georges and Ben Harnwell highlights how inflated housing costs exacerbate inflation and reduce disposable income. Voters should be concerned about these developments as they face potential increases in foreclosures, unaffordable living conditions, and a lack of effective government intervention.</strong></p>\n<h4>Escalating Home Prices in Battleground States</h4>\n<p>Sophia Georges and Ben Harnwell’s discussion underscores a critical issue: the skyrocketing home prices in battleground states like Atlanta, Georgia, and Arizona. Georges points out that home prices in Atlanta have surged by “65% over the last couple of years” and in Arizona, affordability has plummeted by nearly “29% just in the past couple of years.” These increases are not isolated incidents but reflect a broader trend affecting crucial swing states that could influence the upcoming elections.</p>\n<h4>Consumer Price Index and Housing Affordability</h4>\n<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often touted as a measure of inflation control, but Georges critiques its effectiveness, stating that “70% of that overall number is attributed to housing.” Despite the CPI showing a more minor increase in recent months, the real issue lies in housing costs. The index’s reliance on housing prices means rising home costs skewing inflation data, giving a misleading impression of economic stability. As Georges highlights, “this consumer Price Index number… although on the surface they may try to say that this is a positive number, it’s still a source of concern.”</p>\n<h4>Kamala Harris’s Homeowners Policy: A Reckless Approach?</h4>\n<p>Harris’s new homeowners policy, intended to make homeownership more accessible, is under scrutiny for being potentially reckless. Georges and Harnwell argue that the policy’s focus on financial assistance and lowering interest rates may exacerbate the affordability crisis rather than alleviate it. Harnwell notes, “throwing money at a situation giving people money for down payments… is really not going to cut it,” suggesting that such measures may lead to increased foreclosures and higher rent, rather than solving the underlying affordability issues.</p>\n<h4>Why Voters Should Care</h4>\n<p>The financial implications of these housing market dynamics are significant for voters. The surge in home prices and inadequate policy responses could lead to widespread economic hardship. Voters should be alarmed by the potential for increased financial strain, as “Americans are working two jobs and still not able to make it to the end of the month,” as noted by Georges. The potential for rising foreclosures and the erosion of disposable income highlights a need for effective policy solutions that address the root causes of inflation and housing affordability.</p>\n<h4> A Call for Action</h4>\n<p>With home prices soaring and ineffective policy measures potentially worsening the situation, voters must stay informed and advocate for comprehensive reforms. Georges and Harnwell’s discussion serves as a crucial reminder of the financial challenges facing American families and the need for responsible policymaking. As the housing market evolves, policymakers must proactively address these issues to prevent further economic hardship.</p>\n<p>This analysis underscores the urgency for voters to consider the implications of current housing policies and advocate for solutions that ensure financial stability and affordability in the face of rising living costs.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Sophia Georges:</p>\n<h1>Georges Explains How Trump’s Policies Will Solve Housing Crisis, Not Kamala’s Communist Approach</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4>Constitutional Requirements for State Election Integrity</h4>\n<p>Under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, states have a crucial responsibility to ensure that all eligible citizens can vote while preventing invalid votes from being cast. This dual obligation means states must both avoid disenfranchising qualified voters and prevent corruption that leads to vote dilution. Ensuring this balance is key to maintaining trust in the electoral process and upholding democratic values.</p>\n<h4>United Sovereign Americans’ Legal Actions</h4>\n<p>The United Sovereign Americans organization has filed lawsuits in nine states, covering 173 electoral votes, arguing that these states failed to meet constitutional and federal requirements. They allege that 29 million voter registration records are invalid, and 10 million of these invalid registrants were allowed to vote in the 2022 elections. This, they claim, undermines the principle of equal representation and dilutes the power of legitimate votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource website:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://unite4freedom.com/\">United Sovereign Americans</a></p>\n<h4>Challenges and Legal Strategies</h4>\n<p>The group argues that despite raising these issues, states have not rectified the problems. They seek to compel states to adhere to election laws through mandamus orders, which require officials to perform their duties under the law. These orders aim to ensure that elections meet established standards before they are certified. The legal strategy involves proving that states failed to comply with Congressional mandates, which include maintaining rigorous error rates in vote counting.</p>\n<h4>Consequences of Non-Compliance</h4>\n<p>If states ignore court orders, they could face financial penalties or, in severe cases, jail time for officials who refuse to comply. Historically, federal judges have intervened to enforce compliance with Congressional mandates, including desegregation orders. The current goal is to establish monitoring procedures and provisional ballots to ensure proper vote counting and prevent certification of flawed results.</p>\n<h4>How Citizens Can Get Involved</h4>\n<p>Citizens concerned about election integrity can support these efforts by visiting UniteFreedom.com. The site provides opportunities to gather evidence during early voting and throughout the election process. By actively participating, individuals can help demonstrate failures in the electoral system and advocate for the protection of voting rights.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Trust in the election process is foundational to American democracy. Ensuring that all eligible votes are counted correctly and preventing fraud is essential for maintaining this trust. United Sovereign Americans’ legal battles highlight the ongoing struggle to uphold these standards and protect the integrity of elections for future generations.</p>\n<p>For more information, watch this Saturday WarRoom segment with Marly Hornik:</p>\n<h1>In 20 States, United Sovereign Americans Found 29 Million Facially Invalid Registration Records</h1>\n</div>\n"

As loopholes for illegal voter registrations surface, voters must push for stronger ID laws to ensure only U.S. citizens can cast ballots in upcoming elections.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>As Szynkowicz warns, “We cannot afford to ignore these cracks in the system.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Training resources located at:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://fightvoterfraud.org/about-us/\">Fight Voter Fraud</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upcoming Webinar</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>A 15-minute webinar is<strong> scheduled for September 26</strong>, where attendees can learn about recent developments and how to address issues related to voter rolls and election integrity. The webinar will be hosted on the website fightvoterfraud.org.</li>\n<li><strong>Minnesota Training Sucess</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>In Minnesota, there was a change allowing non-U.S. citizens to obtain driver’s licenses, which inadvertently registered them to vote—a practice deemed illegal. This issue has led to over a thousand names being flagged and potentially removed from the voter rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Loopholes in Election Laws are Creating Vulnerabilities in Voter Integrity</h4>\n<p>In an age of intense political polarization, election integrity remains a critical issue, yet certain states’ lax voter ID laws have left voters concerned. Saturday’s revelations on the WarRoom from election integrity activist Linda Szynkowicz expose an urgent need to address these loopholes. During a conversation with Ben Harnwell, Szynkowicz discussed how Minnesota’s automatic registration of non-citizens with driver’s licenses uncovered over a thousand illegal voter registrations. This, she argued, is just the tip of the iceberg. \"We had 1,000 illegal voters registered because of state policies, and they had to be deactivated,” Szynkowicz emphasized, pointing out the cascading effects of unvetted voter rolls.</p>\n<p>WHO IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>North Carolina Voting ID</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>North Carolina has faced controversy over allowing college student ID numbers as acceptable voter ID. This has raised concerns as these IDs do not indicate citizenship status, potentially allowing non-citizens to vote.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Connecticut Voting Regulations</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>In Connecticut, college students can register to vote using just a letter from their university, without needing to present a student ID or proof of citizenship. This practice has been criticized for its lack of stringent verification.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New Hampshire Legislation</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Governor Sununu of New Hampshire signed a bill requiring U.S. citizenship verification and ID or passport presentation for voting. However, this new law will not take effect until after the November elections.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pennsylvania Mail-in Ballots</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court upheld the requirement for voters to date their mail-in ballot envelopes, countering arguments that this was too complex for voters. This decision aims to ensure compliance with state statutes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Student IDs and International Voting are Undermining Fair Elections</h4>\n<p>North Carolina’s voter ID policies have come under similar scrutiny, particularly for allowing student IDs, including those of international students, to be used as valid identification for voting. This raises questions about how effectively states are vetting their voter rolls to ensure only U.S. citizens can vote. In Connecticut, Szynkowicz notes that students can register to vote with just a letter from their university, bypassing any form of official ID. She stated, \"There are no checks or balances in place in states like Connecticut, which makes it easier for non-citizens to slip through the cracks.”</p>\n<p>With the spotlight on international student IDs and weak voter registration processes, there’s growing concern about the potential for manipulation and unfair advantages. As the nation heads into a series of pivotal elections, voters should question how these loopholes could affect outcomes.</p>\n<h4>States Taking Steps to Strengthen Election Integrity</h4>\n<p>Not all states are lagging behind in election security. Szynkowicz applauded New Hampshire and Pennsylvania for their proactive steps toward election integrity. New Hampshire, for instance, has implemented more robust voter ID laws, and Pennsylvania is pushing for similar measures. However, as Szynkowicz notes, the problem persists in many states where laws are outdated or enforcement is lax. \"In Connecticut, for example, universities are the gatekeepers, and there’s no oversight,” she warns.</p>\n<h4>Urgency for Voter Accountability Grows Amid Rising Political Tensions</h4>\n<p>This issue is not just about bureaucracy; it’s about the future of democratic elections. With trust in the electoral process already fractured, these vulnerabilities could further erode confidence. Szynkowicz’s revelations come at a time when Americans are questioning election integrity more than ever. Polls consistently show that a significant portion of voters believe the system is rigged or manipulated, and these latest findings only add to that concern.</p>\n<p>Voters need to remain vigilant and demand transparency. Now is the time to push for stronger voter ID laws and demand accountability from local election officials.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch Saturday’s WarRoom segment featuring Linda Szynkowicz:</p>\n<h1>Szynkowicz Exposes How States Are Registering College Voters With ONLY Their Student Information</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Eric Prince’s recent in-depth WarRoom commentary exposes a significant escalation in safety concerns within the United States. He highlights the increasing instability both domestically and internationally, attributing this to various factors, including failed policies, foreign influence, and ineffective management of immigration and social issues. Prince urges Americans to take the upcoming election seriously, as the choices made will have profound implications for national security and social stability.</p>\n<h4>Growing Safety Risks in U.S. Urban Areas</h4>\n<p>Eric Prince has voiced serious concerns about the current state of safety in American communities, particularly as a result of mismanaged immigration policies and social unrest. According to Prince, the influx of Haitian immigrants into U.S. cities has exacerbated local issues, such as crime and housing shortages. He criticizes the Biden administration’s approach to border management, referring to it as a \"no borders policy” that contributes to destabilization.</p>\n<p>Prince pointed to incidents in places like Springfield, Ohio, where the sudden arrival of thousands of immigrants has led to increased local tensions. He describes the situation as “urban hellholes,” a result of failed governance and ineffective handling of migration. Prince argues that the mishandling of these crises not only strains community resources but also heightens public safety concerns.</p>\n<h4>International Influences and Domestic Instability</h4>\n<p>The conversation with Prince also delves into how international issues are impacting U.S. safety. He cites the unstable conditions in Haiti and Venezuela as examples of how poor governance abroad can have ripple effects domestically. Prince contends that the chaotic situations in these countries contribute to the increased flow of migrants into the U.S., which in turn fuels local instability and crime.</p>\n<p>In Haiti, Prince describes the situation as a \"mess” with rampant poverty and chaos, attributing these problems to poor management and socialist policies. He argues that U.S.-funded NGOs exacerbate the issue by facilitating mass migration, which then spills over into American communities.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Prince discusses Venezuela’s ongoing crisis under the Maduro regime, which he believes has contributed to increased migration and criminal activities in the U.S. He criticizes the U.S. administration for failing to support democratic movements in Venezuela and suggests that the regime’s actions are directly impacting American safety.</p>\n<h4>Recommendations for Addressing Safety and Stability</h4>\n<p>To address these growing safety concerns, Prince advocates for a few key actions:</p>\n<p>Reform Immigration Policies: Prince emphasizes the need for a more controlled and effective approach to immigration. He suggests that current policies are inadequate and contribute to domestic instability. Reforming immigration practices to ensure better management and integration of newcomers could help mitigate some of the issues arising from uncontrolled migration.</p>\n<p>Increase Accountability for Foreign Influences: Prince calls for greater scrutiny of foreign funding and its impact on U.S. institutions, particularly universities. He suggests that attacking the endowments of universities influenced by foreign money could help address the left-wing bias and ideological extremism prevalent in some educational institutions.</p>\n<p>Support Democratic Movements Abroad: Prince advocates for a stronger U.S. stance on supporting democratic movements in countries like Venezuela. He believes that increased pressure on authoritarian regimes and support for opposition groups could reduce the negative impacts of such regimes on U.S. safety and stability.</p>\n<p>Enhanced Local Law Enforcement and Community Support: On a more localized level, Prince suggests that communities need better support and resources to handle the influx of migrants and related challenges. Strengthening local law enforcement and community programs can help address immediate safety concerns and improve overall stability.</p>\n<h4>The Importance of the Upcoming Election</h4>\n<p>Eric Prince’s commentary serves as a stark reminder of the escalating safety risks facing the U.S. He underscores the urgent need for reform and action to address these challenges. With the upcoming election poised to determine the direction of U.S. policies on immigration, foreign relations, and domestic stability, Prince’s warnings highlight the critical importance of making informed choices to safeguard the nation’s future. The decisions made at the polls will have lasting effects on the country’s ability to manage these growing safety concerns and maintain stability.</p>\n<p>For more context watch Friday’s WarRoom with Eric Prince:</p>\n<h1>Erik Prince Warns Of The Muslim Brotherhood And Progressive Factions Destroying America</h1>\n<h1>Erik Prince Exposes The Marxist-Socialist Gang Oppressing The Nation of Venezuela</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<h4><strong>The Rise of Lawfare</strong></h4>\n<p>Lawfare, the use of legal systems and proceedings as a means of political warfare, has increasingly become a tool in the American political arena. This strategy involves leveraging legal actions to hinder or discredit political opponents, often overshadowing genuine legal concerns with politically motivated maneuvers. In recent months, this tactic has been prominently used against former President Donald Trump, illustrating how legal battles can be wielded to obstruct and influence the electoral process.</p>\n<h4>Trump’s Legal Battles: A Case Study</h4>\n<p>The current legal challenges facing Donald Trump underscore the broader use of lawfare in modern politics. As Trump contends with multiple criminal and civil cases, these legal battles have been portrayed by some as politically driven attempts to weaken his 2024 presidential bid. For example, recent developments in the Fulton County case led by District Attorney Fani Willis have sparked significant controversy. Trump and his allies argue that these charges are part of a broader effort to derail his campaign and undermine his political influence.</p>\n<p>Jeff Clark, a key figure in Trump’s legal team, appeared on Friday’s Warroom and talked about the dismissal of several charges against Trump, suggesting that these legal maneuvers are not merely about justice but are strategically aimed at impacting Trump’s electoral prospects. Clark remarked, \"Judge McAfee dismissed three counts from the indictment… Trump benefited from these dismissals,” illustrating how legal victories can simultaneously serve political and legal purposes.</p>\n<h4>Lawfare as a Tool of Voter Obstruction</h4>\n<p>The strategic use of lawfare can effectively serve as a form of voter obstruction. By prolonging legal proceedings and intensifying media coverage, opponents can create a narrative that distracts from the core issues of a campaign and diminishes a candidate’s public appeal. In Trump’s case, the ongoing legal drama has not only diverted public attention but also may have a tangible effect on voter sentiment and mobilization.</p>\n<p>Critics argue that such tactics are designed to stymie Trump’s campaign efforts by keeping him embroiled in legal battles that drain resources and shift focus away from policy discussions. As Clark noted, \"This case is on a very slow boat and it’s not going to be resolved until probably well into 2025,” emphasizing how extended legal proceedings can keep a candidate preoccupied and potentially erode their campaign momentum.</p>\n<h4>The Broader Implications of Lawfare</h4>\n<p>The implications of lawfare extend beyond individual cases. When legal systems are manipulated for political gain, it raises concerns about the integrity of democratic processes and the potential for legal mechanisms to be weaponized against political figures. The Trump case exemplifies how lawfare can be used to not only challenge a candidate’s eligibility but also to reshape the political landscape.</p>\n<p>As the 2024 election approaches, the use of lawfare against Trump serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance regarding the fairness and neutrality of legal proceedings. Ensuring that legal actions are grounded in genuine legal issues rather than political motives is crucial for maintaining democratic integrity and upholding the principles of justice.</p>\n<h4>What Lies Ahead</h4>\n<p>The strategic use of lawfare as a political tool to obstruct and discredit candidates like Donald Trump highlights the evolving tactics in modern political conflicts. By understanding and addressing these issues, voters and policymakers can better navigate the complexities of the electoral process and safeguard the principles of fair and impartial justice.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this Friday segment featuring Jeff Clark:</p>\n<h1>Jeff Clark Updates The WarRoom On Fani Willis Case</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a powerful analysis on Friday’s WarRoom, Monica Crowley exposed a key strategy of the Kamala Harris campaign and the broader Democratic movement: gaslighting and demoralizing Trump supporters.</p>\n<h4>THEY ARE GASLIGHTING US</h4>\n<p>According to Crowley, this pattern of behavior has been a cornerstone of the Democratic playbook for years, as they attempt to degrade and dismiss the values and beliefs of the America First movement. However, rather than succumbing to fear or despair, Crowley urges Trump supporters to remain active, engaged, and resolute as the 2024 election approaches.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Crowley points to the media’s deliberate attempts to frame Trump supporters and the America First movement as \"despicable,” echoing past Democratic rhetoric. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>She recalls Barack Obama’s infamous remark that Americans \"cling to their guns and religion” and Hillary Clinton’s characterization of Trump supporters as a \"basket of deplorables.” Today, she argues, the media and the left continue this tradition, \"spewing their propaganda” in an attempt to discredit anyone who dares to challenge the status quo.</p>\n<h4>THAT IS ALL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LEFT</h4>\n<p>Crowley explains that while these attacks are \"infuriating and incredibly insulting,” they also reveal the true disdain that the left harbors for traditional American values. \"They have contempt for the country, for the Declaration, for the Constitution, for free-market capitalism,” she says, adding that those who stand up for these principles are seen as enemies by the political elite. As the stakes of the upcoming election rise, Crowley suggests, the left’s contempt is becoming more transparent, as they can no longer hide their disdain for those who challenge their power.</p>\n<p>The Harris campaign, in Crowley’s view, has been left with little more than gaslighting as a strategy. With their policies failing and their credibility in question, Crowley believes that the left’s focus has shifted to discouraging and demoralizing Trump supporters. By portraying the movement as extreme, dangerous, or irrelevant, they hope to sap the energy of Trump’s base and diminish its ability to mobilize ahead of the election. \"They are elitist snobs,” Crowley declares, emphasizing the growing desperation on the left.</p>\n<h4>STAND FIRM – DO NOT GIVE UP</h4>\n<p>But Crowley’s message is not one of defeat—far from it. She believes that now, more than ever, Trump supporters must take action to ensure their voices are heard. \"We need the army of the awakened,” she proclaims, calling for widespread grassroots efforts to counter the left’s attempts to suppress voter enthusiasm. Rather than retreat in the face of relentless media attacks and gaslighting, Crowley urges her audience to become even more involved, especially through initiatives like \"Trump Force 47” and election integrity efforts.</p>\n<p>\"They could now do a bait-and-switch,” Crowley warns, noting the increasingly \"desperate” moves by Kamala Harris and the Democratic establishment. She stresses the importance of recognizing the danger of this political moment, but also emphasizes the power that lies in staying engaged. \"We have 53 days to go,” she reminds supporters, encouraging them to remain focused, not fearful.</p>\n<h4>GET INVOLVED NOW</h4>\n<p>Ultimately, Crowley’s message is one of empowerment. Despite the left’s best efforts to discourage, dismiss, and gaslight, she believes that the America First movement is stronger than ever. Crowley insists that the media’s attacks are a sign of weakness, not strength, on the part of the Democrats, and that Trump’s supporters must seize this opportunity to fight back. \"A desperate system is an increasingly dangerous system,” she concludes, but with action, determination, and unity, the movement can overcome these challenges.</p>\n<p>As Crowley reminds us, the key to victory lies in refusing to sink into panic or fear and staying active in the fight for America’s future.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/\">Make A Big Impact With A Small Time Commitment. <span>Join Trump Force 47 Today!</span></a></p>\n<p><strong>See our past coverage of critical resources:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/message-from-steve-bannon-from-prison-mobilize-voters-and-election-workers-to-stop-the-steal/\">Message from Steve Bannon from Prison: ‘Mobilize Voters and Election Workers to Stop the Steal’</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>For more context watch the full segments with Monica Crowley on Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>“They Can No Longer Hide Their Contempt”: Crowley On Elite Democrats’ Opinion Of Average Americans</h1>\n<h1>They want you in despair.

Posobiec revealed disturbing details about how local law enforcement was underutilized and overshadowed, raising critical questions about the impact of defunding policies on national security.</h4>\n<p><span><strong>Bottomline: </strong>Democrat Presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s position on Defunding the Police:  <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-embarrassment-of-democrats-wearing-kente-cloth-stoles\"><strong>The Embarrassment of Democrats Wearing Kente-Cloth Stoles </strong></a>Her sister,Maya Harris-West, wrote a 2003 manual on Defunding the Police: <a href=\"https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/organized-for-change\"><strong>Organized for Change: The Activist’s Guide to Police Reform.</strong></a></span></p>\n<p><strong>The Disregard for Local Law Enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>Jack Posobiec’s discussion on the assassination attempt underscored a crucial point about the involvement of local police. According to Posobiec, the tragedy on July 13th involved severe security failures, with local police being sidelined despite their critical role. He pointed out that the local law enforcement agencies in Butler, Pennsylvania, were crucial in responding to the incident but were overshadowed by federal agencies like DHS and the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Posobiec explained, “We revealed twelve independent security failures on the day of the attack. Many of these failures involved local law enforcement agencies who were not given the resources or recognition they deserved.” This statement highlights a broader issue where local police are often underfunded and undervalued, despite their pivotal role in ensuring public safety.</p>\n<p><strong>The Democrats’ Defunding Agenda</strong></p>\n<p>The conversation between Crowley and Posobiec also touched on the controversial topic of police defunding, a policy pushed by some Democrats that has led to a significant reduction in local law enforcement resources. This agenda has raised concerns about public safety and national security, especially in light of high-profile incidents like the assassination attempt on Trump.</p>\n<p>Posobiec criticized the defunding movement, stating, “Local police are often the first responders in critical situations. By defunding them, we are stripping our communities of essential protection and making them vulnerable.” This criticism aligns with broader concerns about how defunding policies impact law enforcement’s ability to respond to emergencies and maintain public order effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cover-Up and Its Implications</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the issues with local police, Posobiec and Crowley discussed the broader implications of the assassination attempt and the perceived cover-up by federal agencies. Posobiec highlighted how the Secret Service and DHS obstructed efforts to investigate the incident fully. He said, “The mainstream media seems uninterested in the local law enforcement’s role, and there is a deliberate effort to cover up what really happened on July 13th.”</p>\n<p>This obstruction not only hinders justice but also undermines trust in the institutions responsible for safeguarding the public. Posobiec’s investigation revealed that despite the involvement of local police, their contributions were minimized, and their challenges in handling the situation were not adequately addressed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Need for a Balanced Approach</strong></p>\n<p>The discussion underscores the need for a balanced approach to law enforcement funding and oversight. As Posobiec and Crowley highlighted, local police play an essential role in maintaining security and responding to emergencies. However, the defunding agenda risks undermining their effectiveness and compromising public safety.</p>\n<p>Posobiec concluded, “The push to defund local police is not just a policy issue; it’s a matter of national security. We must ensure that our local law enforcement agencies are adequately funded and supported to protect our communities effectively.”</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The conversation between Monica Crowley and Jack Posobiec sheds light on the critical role of local police in responding to high-profile incidents and the detrimental effects of defunding policies. By emphasizing the importance of supporting and adequately funding local law enforcement, Posobiec and Crowley argue for a reevaluation of current policies to ensure that our communities remain safe and secure.</p>\n<p>Posobiecs recent book addresses this situation in greater detail:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGVV4NB\"><span>Bulletproof: How a Shot Meant for Donald Trump Took Out Joe Biden </span></a></h4>\n<p>For more context, watch the full interview with Jack Posobiec on Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Jack Posobiec New Book Exposing THIRTEEN Independent Security Failures</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>As early voting begins in mere days, a critical gap in the Trump campaign’s strategy has emerged, raising alarms among political activists and conservative leaders. Ralph Reed, a prominent figure in conservative circles, appeared on Thursday’s WarRoom and talked to Dave Brat about the growing urgency he sees to address a significant oversight: the apparent lack of a robust ground game strategy by Trump’s campaign to reach Christians and remind them to vote in the General Election.</p>\n<p>Republican election groups are discussing how the Trump campaign’s lack of urgency and strategic planning is placing an enormous burden on independent political activists. These activists are now tasked with reaching and mobilizing voters who may otherwise overlook or resist casting their ballots.</p>\n<h4>REPUBLICANS NEED TO REACH VOTERS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS DO</h4>\n<p>On the WarRoom, Reed and Brat focused on the dire need for a concentrated effort to reach<a href=\"https://politicaldictionary.com/words/low-propensity-voters/#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20politics,%20%E2%80%9Clow%20propensity%20voters%E2%80%9D\"> low-propensity</a> voters, particularly within Christian communities. This demographic, historically a stronghold for conservative candidates, faces unique challenges in the current political landscape. Reed’s insights underline a crucial point: while the Trump campaign focuses on high-profile endorsements and media appearances, the grassroots effort to engage and energize voters is lagging.</p>\n<p><strong>Low Propensity Voters</strong> are eligible but infrequent participants in elections, often missing key votes due to barriers like voter ID laws and inconvenient polling locations, or due to personal disinterest. Campaigns target them to boost turnout in close races, facing challenges in engagement and resource allocation.</p>\n<h4>TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NOT HITTING THEIR MARK</h4>\n<p>Reed’s critique centers on the lack of a systematic, on-the-ground approach to voter outreach. The Trump campaign’s apparent deficiency in building a comprehensive ground game has left many concerned about the effectiveness of its voter mobilization efforts. Without a strategic focus on grassroots engagement, the campaign risks underestimating the importance of personal contact and localized persuasion, essential for driving voter turnout.</p>\n<p>The implications of this strategic gap are significant. Independent activists and organizations are stepping into the breach, striving to connect with voters who may feel disenchanted or disinterested in the electoral process. This task is fraught with challenges, as many potential voters are disengaged and resistant to participating in a system they view as flawed or corrupt. The pressure on these activists is immense, as they work tirelessly to overcome voter apathy and skepticism.</p>\n<h4>CHRISTIANS NEED TO FILL IN THE GAPS</h4>\n<p>Reed’s message is clear: Christian and religious communities must play a pivotal role in addressing this gap. His organization, which has been active in distributing voter guides and educating voters, highlights a crucial strategy in this effort. By focusing on grassroots outreach and voter education, Reed aims to mobilize a large and influential segment of the electorate. His approach is not just about rallying support but also about reinforcing the values and principles that resonate with conservative voters.</p>\n<p>The urgency of this message cannot be overstated. As election day approaches, the stakes are high. The Trump campaign’s lack of a proactive ground game strategy places additional pressure on activists to bridge the gap and ensure that voters are not only aware of the election but motivated to participate. Reed’s emphasis on Christian voter mobilization reflects a broader strategy to harness the power of faith-based communities in the fight for the Republic.</p>\n<p>The current election landscape is marked by a critical strategic shortfall in the Trump campaign’s ground game. Ralph Reed’s focus on mobilizing Christian voters and emphasizing the need for grassroots engagement underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to address this gap. As independent activists step up to fill the void, their work will be crucial in determining the election outcome.</p>\n<p>The call to action is clear: to save the Republic, every effort must be made to reach and energize voters, ensuring their voices are heard and their votes are cast.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full interview with Ralph Reed from Thursday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Ralph Reed Reveals How The Evangelical Vote Is Key To Unlocking Millions Of Low Propensity Voters</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Joe Allen, host of Tuesday’s Battleground WarRoom and former federal prosecutor T.J. Harker recently talked about the growing distrust in the federal government, particularly concerning its selective application of laws and the manipulation of “misinformation” to target Trump supporters. Their conversation focused on the recent indictment of two Russian nationals involved with Tenet Media, who are accused of spreading pro-Russian propaganda. Notably, Tenet Media and prominent right-wing commentators like Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, and Dave Rubin were not indicted, nor were they explicitly named in the indictment. According to Harker, this raises questions about the real intent behind the legal actions.</p>\n<p>Harker criticized the DOJ’s approach, asserting that the indictment’s primary goal was not to prosecute the two Russians but to tarnish American conservative commentators by associating them with Russian disinformation.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> Harker argued, \"The goal in the Department of Justice is to discredit American right-wing commentators by causing Americans to associate them with the Russians.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He further explained that this tactic mirrors a broader strategy of delegitimizing dissenting voices by linking them with a geopolitical adversary. The intent is not to address any actual disinformation or harmful influence but to create a narrative that portrays these commentators as part of a nefarious scheme.</p>\n<p>The discussion pointed out a troubling pattern in how the federal government handles allegations of misinformation. Harker noted that historically, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was rarely used in criminal cases until recently.</p>\n<p>Now, it appears to be wielded as a tool to target specific groups. Harker emphasized, \"This is really a technical violation of a failure to register,” suggesting that the indictment was less about addressing severe criminal behavior and more about politically motivated harassment.</p>\n<p>This strategic use of legal instruments to target political adversaries has significantly eroded public trust in the federal government. Allen and Harker highlighted how the DOJ’s actions contribute to a perception of bias and selective enforcement, undermining the credibility of federal institutions. Harker observed that the indictment’s real impact was seen in its effects on Tenet Media and its associated commentators, who faced job losses and reputational damage, rather than any substantial legal consequences for the accused Russian nationals.</p>\n<p>The broader implication, according to Harker, is that the government’s focus on discrediting certain media figures rather than addressing actual threats or misinformation is indicative of a larger agenda. He remarked, \"It’s not about the truth or falsity of the information; it’s simply about de-platforming and defunding those people who want to send a message that is both consistent with the truth and inconsistent with the leftist orthodoxy.” This approach, he argues, not only distorts the role of the DOJ but also fuels a divisive climate where legitimate criticisms and political discourse are suppressed under the guise of national security.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this misuse of misinformation accusations has led to a profound loss of trust among Americans. By selectively targeting and discrediting conservative voices, the federal government exacerbates existing divisions and undermines its credibility. The conversation between Allen and Harker underscores a critical need for transparency and fairness in how misinformation and political dissent are handled, highlighting the detrimental effects of a government that appears more interested in stifling opposition than in addressing genuine threats to public discourse.</p>\n<h1>TJ Harker Breaks Down The Tenet Media Indictment And The Russian Nationals Involved</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Tonight’s presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris promises to spotlight the sharp contrasts in their visions for America’s future and the mounting strategic pressures on each campaign. As Trump and Harris prepare for their face-off, the stakes have never been higher, with intense scrutiny falling on Trump’s unconventional ground game, which has been the subject of growing frustration and criticism.</p>\n<h4>MEDIA IS ON THE PROWL</h4>\n<p>The media, particularly outlets like MSNBC, have fervently seized upon Trump’s campaign’s perceived shortcomings.</p>\n<p>MSNBC’s Joy Reid has emphatically stated that “Kamala Harris has to nail” the debate to “put Trumpism in the dustbin of history.”</p>\n<p>Reid’s comments underscore a broader media narrative that depicts Trump’s campaign as floundering, with a focus on its disjointed and inadequate ground game. This coverage has intensified the pressure on Trump’s campaign staff, exposing what many view as serious flaws in their grassroots operations compared to Harris’s more traditional and methodically organized efforts.</p>\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/09/09/2024/donald-trumps-unconventional-ground-game-is-making-republicans-nervous\">reports</a> from Semafor and corporate media have exacerbated concerns, revealing that “behind the scenes, the concerns and criticisms are multifaceted.” The Trump campaign’s departure from the centralized, traditional strategies of 2016 has resulted in a heavily outsourced voter turnout operation. By relying on conservative groups such as Turning Point Action, America First Works, and the Elon Musk-backed America PAC, Trump’s campaign has adopted a decentralized approach that has left many within the Republican Party anxious and disillusioned.</p>\n<h4>REPUBLICANS ARE GETTING ANXIOUS</h4>\n<p>Former RNC members and strategists openly criticize the campaign for its lack of cohesion and transparency, with some even fearing that this disorganization could severely impact down-ballot races.</p>\n<p>In addition to internal Republican discontent, swing-state senators like North Carolina’s Thom Tillis have sounded alarms about the GOP’s diminished organizational edge. Tillis has noted a stronger and more coordinated Democratic ground game, further heightening concerns about Trump’s ability to maintain his competitive stance. Reports from Republican operatives indicate that the campaign’s focus on poll watching—driven by Trump’s claims of election fraud—has overshadowed crucial voter turnout efforts. Critics argue that this emphasis on poll watchers is undermining essential voter engagement, leading to a growing sense of unease among Trump’s supporters.</p>\n<h4>HARRIS IS A RISING STAR OF GROUND GAMES</h4>\n<p>In stark contrast, Harris’s campaign has been lauded for its rigorous planning and targeted voter outreach. Her supporters highlight a well-structured strategy to mobilize voters effectively, presenting a clear counterpoint to Trump’s fragmented and troubled approach. This contrast has only intensified the anxiety among Trump’s base, who worry that the unconventional ground game might not be sufficient to secure a victory.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s debate will be a critical juncture for both candidates. For Trump, it represents an opportunity to address mounting criticisms and demonstrate the viability of his unconventional strategy. For Harris, it is a chance to consolidate support and capitalize on any perceived weaknesses in Trump’s campaign.</p>\n<p>As the 2024 election cycle approaches its climax, the debate will not only influence the immediate electoral landscape but also shape the race’s final days. With Trump’s campaign under intense scrutiny and his supporters increasingly restless, it remains to be seen whether he can adapt and counteract the growing concerns as the election nears.</p>\n<p>For more information on Trump’s ground game plans- go to <a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/\">Trump Force 47</a></p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>As the debate approaches, Kash Patel is focused on preparing the American public from the WarRoom to understand the core issues, particularly the importance of law and order. The former Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker emphasizes that public safety, immigration, and crime will dominate the conversation. He asserts that law and order are on the ballot this election cycle and criticizes the Department of Justice for its politically motivated focus on former President Trump.</p>\n<h4>Law and Order: The Core Debate Issue</h4>\n<p>Patel, former Chief of Staff to the Department of Defense, prepares Americans for a debate where law enforcement and crime are the central themes. Patel asked Matthew Whitaker about the most essential points the public needs to grasp in the debate. Whitaker didn’t hesitate: \"Law and order is on the ballot this year,” he said, highlighting the critical importance of these issues as the nation heads into another heated election.</p>\n<p>According to Whitaker, American voters should ask how each candidate plans to handle public safety, crime rates, and the security of U.S. borders. He warns that these crucial issues have been neglected under the current administration, creating a scenario where the nation is \"the most insecure since 1938.”</p>\n<h4>The Media’s Influence on the Debate</h4>\n<p>Whitaker also pointed out a challenge candidates will face during the debate—media bias. He anticipates that the moderators will unfairly lean toward Kamala Harris, a point he describes as \"just a reality of how debates are handled nowadays.” In his view, media outlets have distorted coverage to fit a narrative that does not reflect the true concerns of the American people, such as crime and border security.</p>\n<p>This media bias is why Patel insists the debate should not just be about rhetoric or flashy performances but should focus on delivering facts about the pressing issues of law enforcement and security. As Whitaker puts it, \"We need to get back to a system where we support the men and women of law enforcement.”</p>\n<h4>Weaponization of Justice</h4>\n<p>Another significant point Whitaker raised was the politicization of the Department of Justice. He expressed concern that federal law enforcement agencies are diverting attention from critical crime issues to pursue politically motivated cases, particularly against former President Donald Trump. He labeled this approach as \"the most dangerous possible thing,” warning that it undermines the country’s law enforcement foundation.</p>\n<p>Whitaker’s strong critique comes as many conservative voices claim that the justice system is being weaponized against political opponents. \"The DOJ has prioritized going after Donald Trump instead of addressing the real issues Americans are facing—rampant crime and border insecurity,” he said.</p>\n<h4>The Debate’s Focus: Security and Public Safety</h4>\n<p>In the upcoming debate, Patel and Whitaker agree that candidates must focus on restoring law and order. Voters are looking for solutions to rising crime rates and porous borders. \"The American people want to feel safe,” Whitaker stated, and this sentiment will likely shape the debate.</p>\n<p>With law enforcement, immigration, and crime front and center, this debate promises to be a pivotal moment for candidates to present their plans for safeguarding America. Patel’s goal is to ensure that the American public is prepared for what is at stake: \"It’s not just another election—it’s about the future of law and order in this country.”</p>\n<p>For more about this topic, featuring Matt Whitaker, please watch this segment:</p>\n<h1>Matt Whitaker: “This Department Of Justice Has Prioritized Donald Trump”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The escalating tension between Taiwan and China, as discussed by Col. John Mills on War Room with Peter Navarro, sheds light on a global leadership crisis. Their Monday conversation highlighted Taiwan’s increasing concerns over China’s potential military action, specifically the possibility of a quarantine mimicking the Cuban Missile Crisis. With China ramping up its defense spending and Taiwan anticipating action within the next six months, the time for swift, strategic leadership is now.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>As Col. Mills pointed out, Taiwan’s citizens overwhelmingly prefer U.S. leadership under Trump, as they see it as more supportive of their defense needs. “Hands down, they want Trump,” Mills said, underlining the importance of strong leadership that Taiwan can rely on.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Col. Mills, who has been closely monitoring Taiwan’s situation, reported that Taiwan expects China to impose a “quarantine” to block critical sea and air traffic.</p>\n<p>He explained, \"They expect a quarantine, maybe within six months,” highlighting the urgency of the situation.</p>\n<p>The stakes are high, as a blockade could cripple Taiwan economically while avoiding the legal definition of an act of war. This kind of tactic, reminiscent of Cold War strategies, underscores the need for bold leadership from both Taiwan and its allies.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges Taiwan faces is a severe backlog in its defense procurement, with delayed weapons deliveries hampering the country’s readiness to defend itself. As Mills noted, “There’s a huge backlog at the Tucson Raytheon plant. There’s just no way they can catch up.” The delays are caused by supply chain bottlenecks and bureaucratic slowdowns within the Biden administration, which has been slow to sign critical contracts.</p>\n<h4>POOR LEADERSHIP FROM BIDEN-HARRIS CAUSED THIS MESS FOR TAIWAN</h4>\n<p>\"The Biden administration is very slow at getting contracts signed,” Mills pointed out, emphasizing the urgency for a more efficient process. Without timely access to critical military equipment, Taiwan is left vulnerable, further exacerbating the geopolitical tension in the region.</p>\n<p>This backlog is not just a logistical issue; it’s a leadership issue. To resolve it, global leaders need to prioritize the defense needs of democratic allies like Taiwan. Streamlining the defense production process, cutting through red tape, and increasing manufacturing capacity are essential steps. Leadership on this front needs to be decisive. Mills suggested, “Co-production is the way to go,” referencing the need for Taiwan to gain production rights to produce some of its own defense equipment. This would not only accelerate Taiwan’s defense capabilities but also relieve pressure on the U.S. defense system, which is already overwhelmed with commitments to Ukraine and Israel.</p>\n<p>Beyond procurement, leadership in both Taiwan and the U.S. needs to focus on strategic defense measures that can deter Chinese aggression. The “porcupine theory,” which promotes asymmetric warfare through the use of sea mines and submarines, is a promising defense strategy. However, as Mills noted, even these critical defense tools are being delayed: \"Those mines are part of the backlog… very advanced AI-enabled mines, but they are part of the backlog.”</p>\n<h4>THE PROBLEM IS WITH ALLIANCE BUILDING</h4>\n<p>Another critical aspect of leadership involves solidifying alliances and ensuring clear, unwavering support for Taiwan from its global partners.</p>\n<p>The defense of Taiwan is not just a matter of military hardware but a test of leadership on the global stage. Swift, strategic action is required to address the backlog in defense production and secure Taiwan’s ability to defend itself. Co-production agreements, enhanced manufacturing capacity, and a streamlined procurement process are all essential solutions. Moreover, global leaders must stand firm in their support of Taiwan, providing not only military aid but the confidence that they will not stand alone in the face of Chinese aggression. The time for leadership is now, and failure to act decisively could have profound consequences for global security.</p>\n<p>To hear more from Co.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Steve Bannon, currently imprisoned as a political prisoner, has issued a defiant message from behind bars, urging his followers to take action to secure victory in the 2024 General Election. With his release unlikely until just before the voting concludes, Bannon’s message is a rallying cry for intensified voter mobilization efforts.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Harry Enten of CNN gave it away the other day—only a 1% change in battleground states will bring victory for Trump. This will come from low-propensity, low-information voters—Christians being the easiest group to get, although all of it is hard. This is also where the Swifties come in on the other side. We MUST galvanize folks to work on get-out-the-vote canvassing and phone banks every day. Victory is right there,” Bannon relayed to his audience through Grace Chong on Monday’s WarRoom program. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon’s statement referenced an explosive Monday morning poll that shows great movement for the America First agenda:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CNN’s Harry Enten Sounds Alarm About Harris’ Vanishing Lead In ‘Very Pivotal’ Swing State <a href=\"https://t.co/cRzGqadjUD\">https://t.co/cRzGqadjUD</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dailycaller</a> They are gonna steal it again in Pennsylvania and claim that TRUMP never got the black vote but TRUMP won't need PA to win.</p>\n<p>— edward boucher (@flatfishbill) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flatfishbill/status/1833163055728861381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>In the statement from his prison cell on Monday’s WarRoom, Bannon highlighted the critical role of grassroots activism in overcoming his political persecution by getting themselves engaged in the voting process.  He emphasized the moment’s urgency, stating,<strong> \"Victory is within reach, but only if we work on it.”</strong></p>\n<h4>FROM STEVE BANNON TO THE WARROOM-YOU BETTER VOTE:</h4>\n<p>Bannon’s message from prison accentuates the urgency with which the audience must face their daily tasks to save the American Republic.  He underscores that engaging<a href=\"https://warroom.org/adversarial-unity-of-efforts-patti-lyman-urges-gop-to-focus-on-simple-compelling-reasons-to-vote-trump/\"> low-information voters</a> and mobilizing the <a href=\"https://warroom.org/dr-ben-carson-shine-thy-light-why-christians-must-vote-against-the-darkness/\">Christian</a> demographic are essential to swaying key battleground states.</p>\n<h4>GET THE BILL BLASTER APP AND START YOUR DUTY TO BANNON- TODAY WITH THE SAVE ACT:</h4>\n<p>As Chong described, central to Bannon’s strategy is the use of the <a href=\"https://billblasterapp.org/\">BillBlaster App,</a> a tool designed to contact Congress members directly. Chong detailed how Bill Blaster provides a streamlined method for voters to reach out to their representatives, bypassing traditional switchboards to engage with congressional offices directly.</p>\n<p>\"It is an app which you can find in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. Just type in BillBlaster, one word,” Chong explained. The app allows users to make calls and provides contact information, including direct phone lines and email addresses for all Senators and Congress members.</p>\n<p>With just a slim margin needed for victory, Chong stresses, \"We need to ensure that the<a href=\"https://warroom.org/scott-perry-passing-the-save-act-now-is-crucial-for-election-integrity-and-restoring-trust-with-trumps-support-key-to-success/\"> SAFE Act</a> gets passed. It is mission critical.”</p>\n<p>For more on the importance of the SAVE Act, according to WarRoom experts:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/securing-elections-the-save-act-and-the-crucial-role-of-the-continuing-resolution-urgent/\">Securing Elections: The SAVE Act and the Crucial Role of the Continuing Resolution-URGENT</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The BillBlaster app, described by Chong as \"a directory of all the Senators and Congressmen,” is positioned as a pivotal asset in this mobilization effort. \"It’s free. Make sure to download it and fire up their phone lines,” Chong urged. This tool is an indispensable resource for grassroots activists seeking to influence legislative priorities and ensure that Trump-endorsed candidates receive the support they need.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s  Monday WarRoom commentary with Chong aligns with Bannon’s sentiments, emphasizing the need for increased funding and support for Trump-endorsed Senate candidates. He criticized the Republican Senate Committee for withholding resources from pivotal races, which could undermine efforts to secure a Republican majority in the Senate. Navarro’s call to action appeals to use BillBlaster to pressure Senate representatives and secure critical victories in the upcoming elections.</p>\n<p>For more on the Bill Blaster:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-importance-of-being-heard-warrooms-bill-blaster-empowers-citizens-to-make-an-impact/\">The Importance of Being Heard: WarRoom’s Bill Blaster Empowers Citizens to Make an Impact</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>With the stakes higher than ever, Bannon’s rallying cry from behind bars serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of grassroots involvement and voter engagement in the upcoming 2024 General Election.</p>\n<p>Watch the entire segment with Chon and Navarro:</p>\n<h1>Call Congress TODAY to Demand the SAVE Act is Passed – Download BillBlaster to Take Action!</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In heated remarks about debate tactics and key issues that he said President Trump should consider, Peter Navarro aimed at  Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, highlighting her controversial record on marijuana enforcement and prison reform during her time as California’s attorney general. Navarro, offering what he called \"unsolicited suggestions” for Trump’s debate preparation, emphasized that Harris’s actions while in office create a significant point of vulnerability that should be exploited during the upcoming debates.</p>\n<p>One of Navarro’s sharpest criticisms focused on Harris’s past role in prosecuting marijuana-related offenses, juxtaposed with her more recent comments on legalization.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> “This whole thing about what she did was prosecuting, I’m proud black men in San Francisco, and then light up a bong at night and laughed about it,” Navarro said, referencing Harris’s admission of smoking marijuana recreationally while holding a public office. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He pointed out the hypocrisy of her position, emphasizing the dissonance between her personal use and her strict enforcement of marijuana laws, which disproportionately affected minority communities.</p>\n<p>Navarro displayed the frustration many feel toward Harris, particularly among African American men, for her failure to deliver on promises of criminal justice reform, especially around minor marijuana offenses. He explained that Harris’s and Biden’s pledges to release prisoners serving time for these offenses have largely gone unfulfilled, further undermining her credibility: “A lot of black men are not buying what she’s selling, particularly since both she and Biden promised to let free from prison everybody who was in for these minor marijuana charges.”</p>\n<p>The former Trump advisor didn’t stop there. He connected this inconsistency with Harris’s broader record on prison labor and sentencing. Navarro criticized her for keeping people in prison beyond their sentences, using them as cheap labor for the state of California. \"She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor,” Navarro charged, pointing out a scandal that has haunted Harris throughout her political career. This critique was part of his broader theme about holding Harris accountable for her actions, particularly in relation to her role in shaping California’s prison system.</p>\n<p>Navarro also positioned these criticisms within a larger narrative about the upcoming debate strategy. He suggested that Trump should seize on these contradictions, describing Harris as someone who, while presenting herself as progressive on criminal justice reform, acted in ways that undermined the very communities she claims to champion. “That’s how you deliver a blow… hanging her with her own actions,” Navarro stated emphatically, urging a full-throated confrontation of Harris’s record during the debates.</p>\n<p>The issue of marijuana legalization and Harris’s handling of it could resonate with voters—especially those who feel betrayed by her failure to follow through on her promises. By focusing on these inconsistencies, he argued, Trump could paint a picture of Harris as a politician who talks one way and acts another. \"Kamala Harris’s record is full of contradictions, and they should be front and center in any debate with her,” Navarro concluded.</p>\n<h1>MUST-WATCH: Dr. Navarro’s Six Suggestions For President Trump’s Debate</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Peter Hoekstra, the newly appointed leader of the Michigan Republican Party, appeared on the Friday WarRoom program and laid out the critical importance of unifying the GOP and rallying grassroots support to ensure Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Formerly a congressman and U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, Hoekstra’s appointment follows a period of internal strife within the Michigan GOP, marked by fierce infighting and leadership changes.</p>\n<p>Hoekstra, who took over from Kristina Karamo, acknowledged the challenges he faces.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"There are still people out there who don’t like that I was selected to replace Kristina Karamo,” he said. \"But the bottom line is, the party is totally united in electing Donald Trump as the next President of the United States and putting Michigan in the win column.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite some remaining discontent, Hoekstra is focused on a unified approach to mobilize voters. He emphasized that his role is not about personal recognition but about supporting Trump and key Republican candidates like Mike Rogers, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Debbie Stabenow.</p>\n<p>\"Mike Rogers is our candidate for the U.S. Senate,” Hoekstra noted. \"This is a great opportunity for Republicans to pick up a Senate seat in Michigan for the first time since 1994.”</p>\n<p>Hoekstra’s strategy includes an extensive voter outreach campaign, leveraging Trump’s influence to energize the grassroots. \"There’s no better motivator than Donald Trump to get the grassroots folks motivated to come out and vote,” he stated. He highlighted recent successes, including Trump’s multiple appearances in Michigan, which have helped galvanize local support. \"We had Donald Trump for JD Vance in the state four times in nine days,” Hoekstra said.</p>\n<p>To maximize voter turnout, Hoekstra is deploying a multi-faceted approach. He emphasized the importance of grassroots involvement and highlighted the efforts of Trump’s \"<a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/\"><strong>Trump Force 47</strong></a>,” a volunteer-driven initiative focused on reaching low-propensity voters. Hoekstra revealed that his team has over 100 staff members dedicated exclusively to this get-out-the-vote effort, a testament to the campaign’s commitment to engaging every possible voter.</p>\n<p>The discussion also touched on Michigan’s diverse political landscape, including the crucial battleground areas such as Detroit, Southeast Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Detroit is a strong Democratic stronghold, but we’re working to do better in the black vote there,” Hoekstra explained. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He mentioned endorsements from influential figures like former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick aimed to improve Trump’s performance in the area. Additionally, he addressed the impact of Biden’s policies on the state’s auto industry, suggesting that discontent among union workers could benefit the GOP.</p>\n<p>For supporters looking to contribute to the Michigan GOP’s efforts, Hoekstra outlined several key actions. He urged individuals to visit the Michigan Republican Party website to sign up for \"Trump Force 47” and engage in local get-out-the-vote activities. \"We need them to sign up for Trump Force 47 and get involved with their local parties,” he advised. This includes door-to-door canvassing, distributing informational materials, and helping with voter registration efforts.</p>\n<p>Hoekstra’s call to action is clear: unite the party, harness grassroots energy, and mobilize voters to secure a win for Trump and the GOP in Michigan. His focus on both strategic outreach and grassroots involvement underscores the critical role that local efforts will play in shaping the 2024 election.</p>\n<p>For more from Hoekstra, watch this segment from Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Pete Hoekstra: Biden, Harris, And Whitmer Have Destroyed The Automobile Industry In Michigan</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Jack Posobiec appeared on the WarRoom on Thursday and talked to host Dave Brat about the current U.S. foreign policy. He said that the Biden administration has left the nation overstretched and vulnerable, with rising global tensions and military exhaustion. Posobiec said President Donald J Trump’s return to the White House is essential to restoring American strength, avoiding unnecessary conflicts, and focusing on critical security threats, particularly from China.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Four years ago we were not at war,” Posobiec remarked, pointing to how quickly the global situation has deteriorated under the Biden administration. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Posobiec highlighted that under Trump’s previous administration, the U.S. was not engaged in multiple conflicts, contrasting with the current situation involving “14 hotspots around the globe” that drain military resources and weaken national security. He criticizes the Biden administration for exacerbating military recruitment and cultural issues through “woke and weaponized” ideologies.</p>\n<p>Posobiec added that he believes Trump’s foreign policy—emphasizing military strength as a deterrent and pragmatic diplomacy—is the solution to the current challenges. He cites Trump’s success with the Abraham Accords and direct negotiations with North Korea as evidence of his effective use of economic and diplomatic power to maintain stability without excessive military engagement.</p>\n<p>Posobiec told the WarRoom that he believes that Trump’s approach to foreign policy, which centers on military strength and diplomatic pragmatism, is the most effective way to navigate these challenges. \"If you have a strong military… then you don’t need to go to war,” he said, emphasizing that Trump’s philosophy is not about projecting military power through endless conflicts but using strength as a deterrent. Posobiec suggested this strategy would avoid the need for “boots on the ground all over the world” while maintaining U.S. influence and security.</p>\n<p>A cornerstone of Trump’s foreign policy approach, according to Posobiec, is his ability to negotiate and broker deals that lead to peace and stability. “What does Trump always push for? It’s business deals. How can we do business with these places?” Posobiec asked, referring to Trump’s success with the Abraham Accords in the Middle East and his direct negotiations with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. Posobiec argued that these accomplishments demonstrated that Trump knew how to leverage economic and diplomatic power to create long-term stability without unnecessary military interventions.</p>\n<p>Posobiec told Brat that he contends that the Biden administration is failing to effectively address the Chinese Communist threat. He criticizes its reliance on “Wall Street and globalists” that have allowed China to dominate trade and manufacturing. He stresses Trump’s use of tariffs and trade policies to confront China’s economic practices.</p>\n<p>Posobiec suggests that Trump’s leadership is needed to pivot U.S. focus back to crucial threats like China and to bring stability through his proven track record of strength in diplomacy and economic leverage. He contrasts this with the current administration’s disorganized strategy and suggests Trump’s return is vital for ensuring national security and avoiding further entanglement in global conflicts.</p>\n<p>For more details, watch these WarRoom clips from Thursday’s program featuring Jack Posobiec:</p>\n<h1>Posobiec: Biden Navy’s Failure To Secure \"Freedom Of Navigation” Has Frightened Out Allies Globally</h1>\n<h1>\"This Team Is Not Ready To Lead”: Posobiec On The Harris-Walz’s Military And Diplomatic Failures</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Mark Mitchell of <a href=\"https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/biden_administration/prez_track_sep04\">Rasmuessen Polls</a>, appeared on Wednesday’s WarRoom program and critically analyzed current polling practices and offered advice on how to navigate potential biases in survey data. Mitchell, who has been closely observing the 2024 presidential race, particularly scrutinized the use of<strong> “suppression polls”</strong> and emphasized the importance of examining cross-tabulations to uncover underlying issues in polling data.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Mitchell explained to host Peter Navarro on the show, \"Suppression polls are designed to create a negative narrative about a candidate. They often use biased questions to skew results.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He cited a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University poll, noting how it \"inflated Harris’s lead by asking loaded questions about gender and race.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell advised focusing on cross-tabs, which provide detailed demographic breakdowns. He argued, \"Crosstabs reveal how different groups actually feel about the candidates, which can expose inconsistencies and biases in the top-line numbers.”</p>\n<p>His analysis of current polls suggested that, despite Harris’s apparent lead, Trump’s past performance in similar situations shows he can overcome these deficits.</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, suppression polls are often crafted with specific biases to drive a negative narrative about a candidate. For example, he pointed to the poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University that showed Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by seven points. He criticized the poll for using loaded questions related to gender and race, which he believes were intended to skew responses and inflate Harris’s lead.</p>\n<p>This kind of tactic, Mitchell argued, creates a misleading impression of the race and is a deliberate effort to suppress support for Trump.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s critique extended to how poll results are presented in the media. He observed that some media outlets, such as The Hill, have highlighted these biased results, amplifying the false narrative of Harris’s strong lead. He stressed that such reporting can have a substantial impact on public perception, making it crucial for consumers of polling data to approach these numbers with skepticism and a critical eye.</p>\n<p>To counteract the potential distortions caused by suppression polls, Mitchell advised focusing on cross-tabulations, or “crosstabs,” which provide detailed breakdowns of how different demographic groups respond to polling questions.</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, crosstabs are essential for understanding the full context of polling data. They reveal how various subgroups, such as independents or specific age demographics, view the candidates, offering insights that the top-line numbers alone may not show.</p>\n<p>Mitchell emphasized that examining crosstabs can help identify inconsistencies and potential biases in poll results. For instance, he noted discrepancies in favorability ratings between different polls, pointing out that polls showing Trump with low favorability among Republicans and independents were inconsistent with other data sources that showed higher favorability among these groups. He suggested that such inconsistencies could indicate sampling errors or deliberate manipulations.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s analysis also included a critique of recent polling trends, particularly those showing Harris with a slight lead over Trump. He questioned the accuracy of these polls, given that Trump has historically performed well in similar situations. By comparing current polls with past elections, he highlighted that Trump has previously overcome similar polling deficits, suggesting that the current data might not be as alarming for Republicans as it appears.</p>\n<p>For more from <a href=\"https://x.com/Mark_R_Mitchell\">Mark Mitchell</a>, watch the full WarRoom segment from Wednesday:</p>\n<h1>Mark Mitchell On How Media Uses Suppression Polls To Spin Elections</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p><strong>Gold Star Families Demand Accountability and Respect from Democrats Kamala Harris and the Biden Administration</strong></p>\n<p>Five Gold Star families appeared publicly on Bannon’s WarRoom and condemned  Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat nominee for President, for her demonstrated lack of empathy and inadequate response following the tragic deaths of their loved ones in the chaotic U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The families who lost their children in the August 2021 Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul expressed their deep frustration and sense of abandonment during Tuesday’s interview on WarRoom Battleground with Matt Boyle of Breitbart News.</p>\n<p>The WarRoom Battleground interview, framed as the Families of Abbey Gate Special, gave these families a platform to voice their grievances against Harris and the Biden administration. The interview highlighted their struggles of ongoing pain and frustration over what they see as a lack of acknowledgment and communication from top officials regarding the tragic loss of their loved ones in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing.</p>\n<p>Christy Shamblin, the mother-in-law of Nicole Gee, one of the 13 service members killed, was particularly vocal on the program. She criticized Harris for her perceived insensitivity and lack of engagement with the families.</p>\n<p>Shamblin was shocked by Harris’s August 31, 2024 social media post criticizing Republican Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump’s participation in a memorial service at Arlington National Cemetery in August 2024.</p>\n<p>Shamblin emphasized that despite numerous attempts to contact Harris and extend an invitation to her to the same Arlington event where Trump appeared, Harris never responded.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Having her post that on social media has made us a target. It’s shocking and unacceptable,” Shamblin stated.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Here is the post:</p>\n<p>Stephen Couri, the father of Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, also voiced his discontent, criticizing Harris and the administration’s handling of the situation. Couri accused the administration of attempting to make the families forget and move on from their grief. \"It’s typical of this administration. They want us to forget and move on, but we will not let them sweep this under the rug,” Couri asserted, denouncing what he views as a pattern of neglect from those in power.</p>\n<p>Jim McCollum, father of Lance Corporal Riley McCollum, echoed similar sentiments, describing his disappointment and personal hurt at Harris’s perceived dismissal of the memorial event. \"This one became personal. There was a beautiful moment to recognize our kids, and it was politicized. It’s disrespectful and painful,” McCollum shared. He also criticized the media for misrepresenting the event and for the ongoing threats faced by the Gold Star families.</p>\n<p>The families reported a consistent lack of substantive response or support from Harris and the Biden administration. They expressed frustration with the ongoing political narrative, which they feel ignores the real issues and sacrifices made by their loved ones. \"The complete lack of acknowledgment and support from the administration shows a disregard for the sacrifices made,” said Shamblin. \"It feels like a deliberate attempt to avoid accountability.”</p>\n<p>When asked what they would say to Harris if given the chance, the families had pointed questions and demands:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Shamblin would ask, \"How can you call the Afghanistan withdrawal a success? <span>And how will you ensure this does not happen again?” </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Couri questioned the administration’s pre-withdrawal actions, asking why they did not prepare for the inevitable collapse of Afghanistan sooner. McCollum emphasized the need for accountability, asking, \"Where have you been for the last three years? What have you done?”</span></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In part two of the program, Coral Doolittle and Kelly Barnett, who also lost their sons in the Abbey Gate attack, shared their poignant reflections on the aftermath of their sons’ deaths. They criticized the administration’s handling of their losses and the media’s attacks on former President Donald Trump.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> Doolittle questioned the motives behind the administration’s actions, asking, \"Why was my child not important enough to do this the right way?” referring to Vice President Harris and the messy, deadly and disasterous withdraw from the region.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Both mothers were distraught by Harris’s absence during the dignified transfer ceremony at Dover Air Force Base and President Biden’s repeated watch-checking, which they found deeply disrespectful.</p>\n<p>Doolittle and Barnett praised Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery, arguing that the media and political opponents lied about his actions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Doolittle noted, \"President Trump paid his respects to our kids and is the only one who took time to meet with their families and honor their names.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The accounts from these Gold Star families expose the enduring suffering, pain and frustration, reflecting a broader sense of betrayal and disrespect.</p>\n<p>Their calls for genuine respect and accountability from those in power serve as a poignant reminder of the real human cost behind political decisions and failures, and they should be addressed, especially before the November election.</p>\n<p>Their stories reveal their losses’ profound impact and demand for respect and recognition from top officials and the public.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this multi-part series of 5 Gold Star families and their messages:</p>\n<h1>Gold Star Families Give Their Reaction To Kamala’s Attack On Trump’s Visit To Arlington</h1>\n<h1>Gold Star Families Rip Kamala’s Lack Of Character For Never Reaching Out To Them</h1>\n<h1>Gold Star Families Describe Feeling Anything But Joy Under Harris</h1>\n<h1>Gold Star Mothers Describe The Agony Of Knowing Their Sons Were One Of The 13 That Died</h1>\n<h1>Gold Star Mothers Describe Biden Mixing Up Their Names During Dignified Transfer</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Homeownership is the pathway to wealth. Most aspire to work hard and live the American Dream by becoming proud homeowners. It is not a Republican or Democrat issue, it is an American issue, a common ground despite political beliefs. In recent years, we have seen this goal and aspiration fade away. The stress on the housing market decline is not based on feelings or sentiment, it is based on facts and data.</p>\n<p>The Trump campaign put out a video on August 28, 2024 titled \"Kamala Harris has COMPLETELY DESTROYED the housing market…” <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/kamala-harris-has-completely-destroyed-the-housing-market-a-trump-administration/1299320964368202/\">The video</a> presented news clips with supporting data describing how home ownership has become unattainable for average Americans. This presentation is in line with what I presented in my WarRoom interview on Augst 27, 2024. The Trump campaign video has the finger on the pulse of average Americans who want to own a home but can’t afford it.</p>\n<p>As was presented on WarRoom, Americans are faced with a drastic decline in affordability in the last 3 to 4 years. Mortgage rates during the Trump administration were at record lows around 3%, but with inflation on the rise, mortgage rates have soared and are currently hovering around 7%. For every 1% increase in mortgage rates, a potential homebuyer loses about 9% of buying power. This is an astonishing number when you put it into perspective. This means that when rates were 3%, if you were able to afford a $500,000 home, now with rates at 7% you are only able to afford a home in the low to mid-$300,000 range.</p>\n<p>Not only have high mortgage rates affected the affordability for most Americans, soaring home prices due to low inventory has further put a strain on the housing market. Recent Fannie Mae statistics unveiled that 62% of existing homeowners had mortgage rates of less than 4%. There is no surprise that now with rates at 7%, many existing homeowners are staying put. They are not giving up their low mortgage rates for higher payments, and you can’t blame them. As a result, the supply of homes for sale has been depleted to record low levels while the demand has not decreased at the same rate. As a result, more demand is vying for fewer homes resulting in multiple offers and soaring home prices.</p>\n<p>The affordability index measures what percentage of income must be earned for someone to purchase a median-priced home. During the Trump administration, chart of the affordability indices in New Jersey as reported by the New Jersey Association of Realtors (NJAR) for July 2024 were over 100% and even reached levels near or at 160%. The current NJAR data for July 2024 has an adorability index of 74%. That means that Americans are only making 74% of what they need to afford a median-priced home. The data for NJ is a microcosm of what is seen around the nation, particularly in the West and Northeast regions of the country that are predominantly run by Democratic administrations.</p>\n<p>The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reports that in August 2024, the affordability index for the Northeast is 84.3% and the West is 68.6%, whereas the Midwest is 119.2% and the South is 97.9%. Overall, the NAR affordability index dropped from 148.2% in 2021 to 93.3% currently. Qualifying income is directly proportional to the affordability index. NAR qualifying income to purchase a median-priced home was a mere $57,888 in 2021 and now a whopping $110,544.</p>\n<p>First-time homebuyers are facing the most challenges with qualifying to purchase a home. First-time homebuyer affordability index was at 97.6% with qualifying income of $55,774 in 2021, but currently the first-time homebuyer affordability is 62.5% with qualifying income of $106,464. There is no surprise that just as the Trump campaign presented in the housing video, many Americans and especially first-time homebuyers do not believe that they can afford a home and believe that their dream is out of reach.</p>\n<p>We need to restore confidence back to the housing market. That confidence can only be restored with overall economic changes – make the United States energy independent, reduce interest rates, incentivize homeowners to sell their homes to increase the supply, reducing the cost of goods and debt, providing high paying jobs, cutting regulations, providing tax relief to individuals and business owners, and showing strength on the world stage. Trump asserts that his administration \"will make home ownership attainable for average American once again…”. If the past is any indication, Trump will restore prosperity back into the housing market, make home ownership a viable goal, and get Americans on the path to wealth building again.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Tuesday night on WarRoom Battleground,  a powerful and thought-provoking discussion, Dr. Derrek Harvey, Dr. Bradley Thayer, and Retired Captain James Fanell explored the intricate geopolitical dynamics unfolding in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. They explored how shifting U.S. strategies influence global stability and alter the balance of power in these critical regions. Their conversation painted a frightening picture of U.S. foreign policy, marked by perceived strategic withdrawals and a lack of decisive action in the face of rising threats.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We want to underscore that aircraft carriers are precious resources. And if no one in the Pacific area introduces a window of vulnerability, it’s a critical political symbol,” Thayer added to the conversation at the end. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Derrek Harvey opened the discussion with a deep dive into the situation in the Middle East, mainly focusing on Iran’s persistent aggression toward Israel. He highlighted how Iran, through its proxies like Hezbollah, has been systematically targeting Israel with a strategy aimed at economic attrition and international isolation. Harvey underscored the urgency of the situation, warning that Iran’s actions are not just sporadic acts of hostility but are part of a broader campaign to undermine Israel’s security and stability. He argued that the U.S. administration’s current stance, which he perceives as too lenient towards Iran, is a significant factor contributing to the growing boldness of Iran’s actions. According to Harvey, the lack of a robust U.S. response is emboldening Iran and its proxies, potentially setting the stage for further escalation in the region.</p>\n<p>As the conversation shifted focus to the Indo-Pacific, Retired Captain James Fanell provided a detailed analysis of the emerging security challenges in the region. He expressed grave concern over the unprecedented absence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Indo-Pacific, marking the first time in over two decades that such a gap in presence has occurred. Farnell emphasized that this withdrawal happens when China intensifies its military activities, directly challenging U.S. allies like the Philippines and Japan. He warned that the U.S. administration’s response, which he characterized as inadequate, is sending a dangerous signal to both allies and adversaries. Farnell argued that this perceived weakness could lead to a broader strategic vacuum, inviting further Chinese aggression and destabilizing the region’s security architecture.</p>\n<p>Dr. Bradley Thayer added depth to the discussion by connecting the dots between these two regions, pointing out that the U.S.’s apparent retreat from its strategic commitments is having a ripple effect across the globe. Thayer emphasized that Iran and China are carefully watching the U.S.’s moves, and any sign of weakness or indecision will likely encourage these adversaries to push their agendas more aggressively. He suggested that a lack of coherent strategy and decisive action by the U.S. could lead to a cascading effect, where multiple regions become more volatile simultaneously, complicating the U.S.’s ability to respond effectively.</p>\n<p>Throughout the WarRoom discussion, all three experts agreed that the current U.S. foreign policy approach is fraught with risks. They called for a recalibration of U.S. strategy to ensure that its global commitments are upheld and that its adversaries are effectively deterred.</p>\n<p>The conversation highlighted the pressing need for the U.S. to project strength and reliability, reinforce its alliances, and counter adversaries with clarity and resolve.</p>\n<p>As the world watches closely, the U.S.’s choices in these regions will have far-reaching implications for global stability and security.</p>\n<p>Watch this two-part series for more details:</p>\n<h1>There Are Lots Of Forces At Play Hindering Israel’s Ability To Address Threats From Iran</h1>\n<h1>For The First Time In 23 Years, The US Does Not Have A Carrier Strike Group In Indo-Pacific</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a fiery 2024 statement, before he had to surrender as a political prisoner to a Federal Correctional facility as a political prisoner, Steve Bannon passionately outlined a vision of political realignment in America, expressing strong confidence in support for MAGA of numerous demographic voting groups and declaring the failure of efforts to suppress the America First movement. Bannon’s comments highlight a belief in a broad coalition forming across racial, economic, and generational lines, poised to deliver significant political victories.</p>\n<p>“You’ve seen it, The Democrats understand we are ascendent; we’re bringing it. 50 percent the Black male vote. We’re gonna get overwhelming majority of the Hispanic vote Asian Americans. The White working class the middle class students. People under 29 years old, it’s all coming our way. And they know that that’s why they’re worried. They thought their plan to steal the election, and then to destroy MAGA and destroy Trump, and send Trump to 700 years in prison at bankrupt him, would work.  That was their plan and thereby grind MAGA into the dust is , and it is the biggest single epic fail in American history. They have failed. Because just like in 1775 and 1776 Patriots fought back.  That is the DNA that comes down from the revolutionary generation, that is what they inspired. This generation and other generations all working together, including young people- who hate the Democart’s policies. We’re growing,” Bannon said on the WarRoom to get his audience ready to go and vote in November.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s words set a narrative of defiance and resurgence, evoking historical parallels to the American Revolutionary War. Bannon said that just as the patriots of 1775 and 1776 resisted tyranny, today’s MAGA movement is driven by a similar spirit of resistance against overreach by the political establishment.</p>\n<p>The comparison vividly paints a picture of a modern struggle for what they see as the true American ideals, suggesting that the spirit of rebellion and the fight for freedom has been rekindled in contemporary political battles.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s comments show his belief that the strategies employed by the patriot’s opponents to undermine the MAGA movement and its figurehead, Donald Trump, have backfired.</p>\n<p>Bannon discussed how those opponents tried to “steal the election” and destroy the America First movement through legal and financial means- called lawfare- as Democrats hoped for a harsh penalty for Trump.</p>\n<p>However, as Bannon highlights, those efforts have failed. Instead, they have invigorated the movement, expanding and consolidating support among diverse voting groups who used to vote for Democrats blindly.</p>\n<p>The only thing this plan needs for total victory is for people to make sure they get out and vote in November and complete the plan.</p>\n<p>Check out this extraordinary Bannon rant:</p>\n<h1>We’re gonna get 50% of the Black male vote, we’re gonna get a majority of the Hispanic vote</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Monday analysis for the WarRoom, Matt Boyle, Washington Bureau Chief for Breitbart News, provided an in-depth look at the current state of the presidential race, emphasizing Donald Trump’s advantageous position in the race to secure 270 electoral votes. Drawing from his extensive experience covering elections, Boyle highlighted the shifting dynamics and strategic advantages that could shape the outcome of the 2024 election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Trump has more pathways to 270 electoral votes than Kamala Harris does,” Boyle stated. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In a WarRoom segment with host Ben Harnwell, Boyle began by outlining the fundamental goal of winning the presidency: securing 270 electoral votes. He pointed out that Trump’s path to victory appears broader and more viable than Kamala Harris’s. \"Trump has more pathways to 270 electoral votes than Kamala Harris does,” Boyle stated. This assertion underscores Trump’s strategic advantage, given the current electoral landscape.</p>\n<p>Key to Boyle’s analysis is the changing political climate in traditionally battleground states. He noted that several states which were once fiercely contested have increasingly leaned Republican. “Florida, Ohio, and Iowa have all moved red,” Boyle explained. These states, totaling 53 electoral votes, have seen a significant shift, with Democrats essentially conceding them in their campaign strategy. This shift not only impacts the overall electoral map but also narrows the competitive field for Harris.</p>\n<p>Boyle elaborated on Trump’s strong position in these states, stating, \"The numbers across the board—whether it’s Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona—seem to show that Donald Trump is the favorite candidate right now.” His analysis is supported by polling data indicating Trump’s lead in these crucial battleground states. For instance, in Pennsylvania, Trump’s lead is reflected in both public and private polls. Boyle noted that internal campaign polls show Trump leading Harris by approximately two percent in Pennsylvania, which could prove pivotal in the race.</p>\n<p>The strategic implications of Trump’s position are significant. Boyle explained that if Trump secures states like Georgia and North Carolina, he would amass a substantial number of electoral votes, bringing him closer to the 270-vote threshold. \"If Trump is able to flip Georgia back and win North Carolina, he gets to 250 electoral votes,” Boyle detailed. This positioning underscores Trump’s multiple pathways to victory, even without winning other battleground states like Arizona or Nevada.</p>\n<p>Conversely, Boyle criticized Harris’s campaign, particularly its failure to generate a post-convention bounce. He attributed this lack of momentum to the disconnect between the Democrats’ messaging and the electorate’s current concerns.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The Democrats have been telling everybody to have joy when things are not joyful in America right now,” Boyle remarked. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He argued that the Democrats’ focus on a message of “joy” and “hope” fails to address the electorate’s pressing issues, such as economic hardship and safety concerns, which are prominent in the current political climate.</p>\n<p>Boyle also highlighted Harris’s avoidance of press interactions, suggesting it might be a strategic move to limit exposure to difficult questions. \"They’re going to have to start doing interviews, they’re going to have to face the questions,” Boyle asserted. This point underscores the mounting pressure on Harris to engage more directly with the media and address voter concerns.</p>\n<p>Watch for the full interview of Matt Boyle from Monday:</p>\n<h1>Matthew Boyle: “Trump Has More Pathways To 270 Electoral Votes Than Kamala Harris Does”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a revealing discussion on social media censorship and election interference, Ben Harnwell and Mike Davis dissected recent news that showed Americans they should be very skeptical of the Democrats when they are in power. The news broke Monday that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, admitted to censoring information on his platform, formerly known as Facebook, regarding Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop—a move that many argue constituted a deliberate attempt to sway public opinion toward Democrat Joe Biden, during the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>This admission has reignited fierce debates about Big Tech’s role in moderating content and its implications for democracy ahead of the looming November elections.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“You remember this—where the majority of the American people said, had they known that the laptop from hell was genuine, that would have changed their vote,” Harnwell told Davis about the poll <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116258/documents/HHRG-118-FD00-20230720-SD011.pdf\">reported</a> by Paul Sperry. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The news broke on Monday that Americans had been denied important election information:</p>\n<p>During their conversation, Harnwell and Davis highlighted how Zuckerberg’s acknowledgment of content suppression could have fundamentally altered the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Davis noted, “The federal government was putting pressure behind the scenes on a social media platform.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This revelation raises significant concerns about governmental overreach and the manipulation of information critical to voters.</p>\n<p>The controversy centers on the now-infamous Hunter Biden laptop story <a href=\"https://rumble.com/vfiz7f-bannon-goes-off-after-hunter-laughs-off-laptop-from-hell-on-kimmel-youre-a-.html\">first exposed by Steve Bannon</a> on the WarRoom, which surfaced in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election. The laptop, purportedly containing sensitive and potentially incriminating information about Joe Biden’s son, was initially dismissed by major news outlets and social media platforms as Russian disinformation. However, subsequent investigations confirmed its authenticity, leading to questions about why it was so vehemently suppressed.</p>\n<p>Davis emphasized the gravity of this censorship, stating, “I can’t think of anything more dangerous and anti-democratic than the federal government putting their hands around the neck of a trillion-dollar, Big Tech monopolist… and essentially coercing that Big Tech monopolist… to censor so-called COVID misinformation.”</p>\n<p>He extended this argument to the Hunter Biden laptop case, illustrating how similar tactics were used to control the narrative and protect political interests.</p>\n<p>The crux of the issue, according to Davis, is the collusion between Big Tech companies and government officials, particularly under the Biden administration. He claimed, “The Biden regime is colluding with these Big Tech platforms to censor Americans, and somehow that’s not election interference?” This rhetorical question underscores the hypocrisy perceived by many critics who view the selective enforcement of information control as an outright attack on free speech and democratic processes.</p>\n<p>Davis argued that the censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story likely had a significant impact on voters’ decisions. “You remember this—where the majority of the American people said, had they known that the laptop from hell was genuine, that would have changed their vote,” he asserted, referencing polls indicating that many Americans felt misled by the suppression of this critical information. He posited that the intentional silencing of the story amounted to election interference, affecting the integrity of the electoral process.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the broader implications of Big Tech’s gatekeeping power over information. Davis called for a renewed focus on antitrust actions against tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple to prevent them from having undue influence over public discourse and political outcomes. He argued, “We need to break them up so they do not have gatekeeping power over information and commerce, and the federal government doesn’t hijack or commandeer their gatekeeping power.”</p>\n<p>As the discussion unfolded, it became clear that Davis and Harnwell view this issue as a pivotal moment in the battle for free speech and fair elections. The use of censorship by social media platforms, especially when influenced by governmental pressure, represents a dangerous precedent that could erode public trust in democratic institutions.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg’s admission that Facebook suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story has opened a Pandora’s box of ethical and legal questions. The revelation that this act was part of a broader pattern of content moderation influenced by political considerations has sparked outrage and calls for accountability.</p>\n<p>As Davis remarked to Harnwell, “When these Big Tech platforms collude with the federal government to censor Americans, they are violating federal law.” This stark assessment reflects a growing concern that the democratic ideals of free speech and open debate are under siege by a powerful coalition of political and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this two-part interview with Mike Davis:</p>\n<h1>Mike Davis On The Results From The Biden-Zuckerberg Censorship Campaign</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Peter Navarro’s Monday remarks offer a searing critique of  Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris’s leadership of the National Space Council. They paint a stark picture of mismanagement and missed opportunities that could have far-reaching implications for her presidential ambitions. His comments serve as a reminder of the crucial importance of understanding government contracts and their role in maintaining U.S. leadership in strategic domains like space.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Under Trump, we were hitting every milestone; now, the wheels have come off,” Navarro stated, highlighting a significant regression in U.S. space capabilities.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Navarro’s primary contention revolves around Harris’s inability to effectively manage the National Space Council, a body reinstated by former President Donald Trump to steer American space policy. Navarro argues that under Harris’s leadership, the council has failed to deliver on the ambitious goals set during the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>One of the key issues Navarro touches on, in the WarRoom segment, is the handling of government contracts, which is crucial for understanding the successes and failures of space policy under different administrations. Government contracts, especially in sectors like aerospace, involve significant taxpayer investment and are often tied to strategic national interests.</p>\n<p>Effective management of these contracts requires financial oversight and a deep understanding of the technical and strategic implications of the projects they support. Under the Trump administration, partnerships with private companies like Boeing and SpaceX were carefully managed to foster innovation while ensuring accountability. Navarro claims this model has deteriorated under Harris’s watch, leading to delays and inefficiencies.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Navarro criticizes Harris for a lack of engagement and leadership, stating that “Kamala Harris has no clue how to lead on space.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He points out that under her tenure, the National Space Council has only held three substantive meetings compared to eight substantive meetings under Trump. According to Navarro, this reduction in engagement has led to a leadership vacuum and a loss of momentum in critical projects such as the Artemis mission, which aims to return humans to the Moon.</p>\n<p>The implications of these failures extend beyond space policy. As she runs for President, her record as Vice President will be scrutinized, and her perceived failures in managing high-profile initiatives like the National Space Council should undermine her credibility as a capable leader.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s remarks suggest that voters should consider these management failures when evaluating Harris’s suitability for the presidency.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> “This is what failure looks like in the White House,” Navarro argues, making a case that Harris’s performance on space policy is indicative of a broader pattern of ineffectiveness.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Understanding the dynamics of government contracts and their management is essential for voters and policymakers alike. Mismanagement not only wastes taxpayer money but also compromises national interests. In the context of space exploration, this could mean falling behind competitors like China, who Navarro warns is “closing in” on U.S. capabilities. The failure to effectively manage government contracts in this domain could have serious implications for national security and economic prosperity.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s critique highlights the importance of effective leadership in government roles, particularly when it comes to managing complex and strategically significant projects.</p>\n<p>As Kamala Harris seeks higher office, her record will be a focal point for debate, and her performance as Vice President will likely be a decisive factor for many voters.</p>\n<p>Understanding the intricacies of government contracts and the consequences of their mismanagement is crucial for anyone looking to assess her suitability for the presidency.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> As Navarro concludes, “We need leaders who understand that space is the next great frontier for America,” and by extension, leaders who can effectively manage the responsibilities that come with such roles.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>To hear more from Peter Navarro on how Kamala Harris is lost in space, watch the full Monday WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Dr. Peter Navarro: “Harris’ Involvement With NASA Science Missions Is Another Disaster”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Peter Navarro, opening up Monday’s War Room program, offered a scathing critique of Dr. Anthony Fauci and the influence of Big Pharma on public health policy that has destroyed the lives of so many people around the globe. Navarro’s firey comments were not just an indictment of Fauci’s financial gains from his career but a call to arms for “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) as a resonant political slogan for voters in the upcoming November elections.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Big Pharma and the Fauci-ites have profited off the suffering of Americans for too long, pushing dangerous medications and flawed science. It’s time we take back our health and hold these corrupt forces accountable,” Navarro said on Monday. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Navarro’s WarRoom critique centers around Fauci, who has been a prominent figure in public health for decades, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, Navarro claims, “made more money than God” from his ties to Big Pharma, suggesting a conflict of interest that has led to policy decisions favoring pharmaceutical companies over the health of Americans. Fauci’s substantial earnings from book deals, speaking fees, and potentially other undisclosed sources have come under scrutiny, especially given the controversial and often changing guidance during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Navarro argues, in the segment, that Fauci’s financial entanglements and the opaque nature of his earnings exemplify the problematic relationship between public health officials and Big Pharma.</p>\n<p>Navarro further elaborates on the impact of what he calls bad science in medicine, which has led to widespread public health issues.</p>\n<p>He points to alarming statistics:</p>\n<p>54% of American children are chronically ill, with increasing rates of anxiety, depression, autism, food allergies, obesity, developmental disorders, and cancer. These numbers, Navarro argues, are a direct result of policies influenced by special interests, including Big Pharma, that prioritize profits over people’s health.</p>\n<p>One of the most striking examples Navarro provides is the increase in autism rates among American children. In the early 2000s, the rate was 1 in 150 children; today, it is 1 in 36. Navarro suggests that environmental toxins, certain ingredients in plastics and pharmaceuticals, and the increase in vaccinations are contributing factors. He highlights the dramatic rise in vaccine recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), noting that children today receive nearly four times as many vaccinations as they did in the 1970s. While vaccines are crucial for preventing diseases, Navarro argues that the sheer number and potentially harmful components warrant closer scrutiny and more informed choices by parents.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s focus on America’s obesity epidemic also illustrates his broader point about the harmful influence of Big Food and Big Pharma. He notes that the average American child today consumes significantly more sugar than a century ago, a trend linked to the rise in childhood obesity and related health issues. The chemicals in processed foods, such as titanium dioxide and brominated vegetable oil, are not just unhealthy but potentially toxic, contributing to a range of disorders from cancer to hyperactivity.</p>\n<p>“Make America Healthy Again” is more than just a slogan, he explained; it’s a call for a return to common-sense health policies prioritizing Americans’ well-being over corporate profits. Navarro argues that this message should resonate with voters in November, especially those who feel betrayed by a system that has allowed Big Pharma and Big Food to dominate public health policy.</p>\n<p>Navarro is galvanizing support for a political movement that seeks to overhaul the health system and protect future generations by highlighting the stark contrast between his vision and the current state of affairs.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s alignment with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump represents a strategic partnership against what they see as the corrupting influence of powerful interests, which the foundation of the Populist movement.</p>\n<p>Despite political differences, RFK Jr.’s endorsement of Trump underscores their shared commitment to challenging these entities. Navarro emphasizes that this alliance is particularly significant as it combines Trump’s political influence with Kennedy’s longstanding advocacy for vaccine safety and health transparency, potentially appealing to a broad spectrum of voters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>As Navarro concludes, the stakes could not be higher: \"If we don’t make serious changes to improve our national public health, our country will only grow more unhealthy.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>By advocating for MAHA, Navarro is not just campaigning for political office but for a fundamental shift in how America approaches health and wellness. This resonant message could be a powerful motivator for voters tired of seeing public health compromised by powerful interests and who desire real change.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidenote: </strong></p>\n<p>“Big Pharma” is a term used to refer to the global pharmaceutical industry, including the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Three years ago, the United States had a growing American populist movement. Host of the WarRoom Steve Bannon has been an influential leader, daily broadcasting strong critiques of foolish government policies and reminding his viewers of the impact of these policies on everyday citizens.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The vast majority of pressure put on by illegal aliens is among the Hispanic and African-American community,” Bannon said. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In the video below, he points out that businesses, particularly those represented by entities like the Chamber of Commerce, benefit from the influx of illegal labor because it allows them to pay less than market wages, avoid healthcare costs, and sidestep other financial responsibilities that would typically apply to legal workers.</p>\n<p>This, according to Bannon, is a deliberate strategy to keep wages low and maximize profits at the expense of American citizens.</p>\n<p>In the following flashback to 2021, Bannon argues that bad government financial policies disproportionately affect minority communities and lower-income groups, not just the “white kids” often mentioned in political rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s response to the claim, which he read at the opening of the segment,  that only white children are impacted by these policies, and that is why white people care,  was pointed:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Sir, you are horribly incorrect. It’s not white kids. It’s Hispanic, African-American, every kid in this country.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>By broadening the focus to all citizens, regardless of race, Bannon emphasizes that populism is about protecting and empowering every American, not just a select group, or tribe or racial set.</p>\n<p>Bannon, in the video, believes that the most significant pressure from illegal immigration and other governmental failures falls on minority communities and he argues that these communities are most affected because they are often at the lower end of the economic spectrum, where competition with illegal immigrant labor is most intense.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s argument is that populism is color-blind and inclusive, focused solely on the interests of American citizens.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Populism is color blind. It doesn’t care about your religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual preference. Here’s what it cares about: it cares that you’re a citizen of this country,” he said. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>By framing the issue in this way, Bannon is challenging both the left and right-wing establishments, which he sees as using race to divide the populace and distract from the economic exploitation facilitated by their policies.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Bannon points to economic indicators under the Trump administration to support his claims about the benefits of populist policies.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> “Donald Trump saw the lowest Hispanic unemployment, lowest African-American unemployment, with wage increases, particularly for people without high school educations—blue-collar over white-collar,” Bannon noted.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Bannon, these achievements demonstrate that when the government focuses on citizen-oriented policies, all Americans, especially those in the working class, benefit.</p>\n<p>As Bannon sees it, the populist movement is not about racial or cultural identity but about economic justice and fair opportunity for all citizens. He urges his listeners to reject the false dichotomy of race and instead focus on the common struggles facing American citizens, especially those most impacted by governmental failures and the elites’ self-serving policies.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s remarks highlight the need for a government that prioritizes its citizens over the elite’s and corporate donors’ interests. He calls for a populist-nationalist movement that transcends race and identity politics and focuses instead on the economic and social needs of all Americans.</p>\n<p>By doing so, he believes that a more inclusive, prosperous, and fair society can be achieved, one that works for the people rather than against them.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this flashback segment from 2021:</p>\n<h1>Bannon Loses It on ‘Morons’ Who Don’t Understand Populism</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Saturday discussion with Royce White on the War Room, Dr. Naomi Wolf shared her strategic insights on how to build winning coalitions in American politics. With a storied career advising Democrat Presidential Candidate Al Gore and other prominent Democrats, Wolf’s advice is grounded in experience and a deep understanding of the electoral landscape.</p>\n<p>Wolf emphasized that a successful campaign requires more than just appealing to the base; it necessitates building broad coalitions that can win over swing voters in key battleground states.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Reflecting on the 2024 electoral dynamics, she stated, “We’ve gone from a sinking ship situation to a victory-ready situation, if the principles take a few simple steps between now and November.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Wolf, the path to victory is not about catering to every demand or wish of the electorate but about strategically aligning with those who can actually deliver the win.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant pieces of advice Wolf offered was the importance of forming alliances with unexpected partners. She pointed to the recent coalition-building efforts between Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former President Donald Trump as a critical move. “Without RFK Jr. joining forces with President Trump… there wasn’t the math, in my view, to win, even if all the base turned out,” Wolf explained. She highlighted that this alliance could bring in disaffected Democrats, independents, and swing voters, especially suburban white women who are fiscally conservative and socially liberal—a crucial demographic in battleground states.</p>\n<p>Wolf’s strategic approach is not just theoretical; it is based on her experience advising Al Gore during the 2000 presidential campaign.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>She noted, “A presidential campaign is not a therapy session. A winning presidential campaign is not a Christmas wishlist where you get every single thing you want.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead, Wolf argued that successful campaigns focus on pragmatic goals and build coalitions that unify diverse groups under a common cause. This requires compromise and a willingness to prioritize broader electoral success over narrow ideological purity.</p>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Wolf stressed the need for Republicans, particularly those supporting Trump, to expand their appeal beyond their traditional base. She urged them to “dial down the language that sounds homophobic” and to embrace a more inclusive message that can attract voters from across the political spectrum.</p>\n<p>“If we get two to three percent of the environmentalists, two to three percent of the black voters, two to three percent of the feminists, two to three percent of the LGBTQ community, we got that coalition,” White agreed and stated emphatically.</p>\n<p>Wolf’s point is clear: winning elections is about adding, not subtracting, and creating a coalition that reflects the diversity of the American electorate.</p>\n<p>Wolf also touched on the importance of addressing issues that resonate broadly, such as public health and environmentalism, in a way that transcends partisan divides. She praised RFK Jr. for bringing attention to the country’s health crisis and criticized how public health has been fragmented by identity politics. “Public health itself has been subjected to identity politics,” she observed, advocating for a more holistic approach that addresses the needs of all Americans.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Naomi Wolf’s advice to those seeking electoral success is to focus on building broad, inclusive coalitions that can appeal to a wide range of voters. Her experience and insights serve as a reminder that winning a presidential campaign is about finding common ground and reaching out to those who may not fit neatly into any one ideological box.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“A winning presidential campaign is about reaching out to what unifies us as Americans,” she concluded, encapsulating her vision for a more united and strategic approach to politics.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For more watch this entire segment:</p>\n<h1>Dr. Wolf Reveals The Electoral Gains President Trump Acquired From Enlisting RFK Jr. As Future Asset</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Flashback to 2022: RFK Jr.’s Explosive Interview with Steve Bannon on Vaccine Mandates and Big Pharma\nIn a 2022 interview on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discussed his controversial book on Dr. Anthony Fauci, Big Pharma, and the COVID-19 vaccine. This discussion has resurfaced as especially timely given Kennedy’s recent public endorsement of Donald Trump for President, a move that has sent shockwaves through both the Democratic Party and the broader political landscape.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“When they say that I am promoting vaccine misinformation, they will never tell you a single piece of misinformation that I have promoted. The term ‘vaccine misinformation’ is a euphemism for any statement that departs from official orthodoxy or that questions the safety and efficacy of a pharmaceutical product, whether that statement is false or true,” Kennedy told Bannon.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kennedy has constantly criticized the involvement of intelligence agencies like the CIA in public health matters, where he believes they have no place. He argued that censorship and control over public discourse are pervasive issues, particularly when it comes to discussions about vaccines and public health. “This is information warfare,” he said, highlighting the strategic manipulation of narratives to silence dissent and protect powerful interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Kennedy’s Endorsement of Trump and the Populist Movement</strong></p>\n<p>The timing of remembering this interview is particularly significant in light of Kennedy’s recent endorsement of President Donald Trump for re-election, which marks a pivotal moment for the <a href=\"https://warroom.org/a-populist-unity-the-irony-of-rfk-jr-endorsing-trump-and-the-promise-of-a-new-political-coalition-mike-benz-in-the-warroom/\">populist movement</a> in America. Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump, despite their differing political backgrounds, underscores a unifying effort to challenge establishment politics and support “America First” policies. As Bannon noted during the interview, Kennedy’s stance is not about being anti-vaccine but about advocating for transparency and accountability—a message that resonates with many Americans across the political spectrum.</p>\n<p>Kennedy, long labeled by mainstream media as a leading figure in the “anti-vax” movement, clarified his position to Bannon, stating emphatically that he is not anti-vaccine but is instead pro-science and against “bad vaccines.”</p>\n<p>He explained that he supports vaccines that are “properly tested in a controlled trial” and have demonstrated positive long-term health outcomes.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>He said, “If you come to me and say, here’s a vaccine that five years after you give it, more people are alive in the vaccine group than the placebo group and they are healthier, I would be 100% for that vaccine. I just want good science.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kennedy also highlighted, to Bannon, the changing industry definition of “misinformation,” which now includes any statement that departs from official narratives or questions the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. He pointed out the absurdity of being labeled an anti-vaxxer simply for challenging the unchecked power of Big Pharma: “The term vaccine misinformation is a euphemism for any statement that departs from official orthodoxies.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy has a long history of advocating for public health and regulatory accountability, a legacy that dates back to his family’s extensive involvement in public health institutions. He criticized Big Pharma for its repeated criminal behavior, noting that the four major vaccine manufacturers have paid $35 billion in penalties since 2009 for various offenses, including knowingly causing harm with their products. “The only place they can never get caught is with vaccines,” he remarked, pointing to the legal immunity vaccine makers enjoy.</p>\n<p>This is an important time for America to understand the Populist movement that is on the ballot in November.</p>\n<p>See the endorsement from Friday, August 23, 2024:</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s alignment with Trump, a figure historically seen as an outsider by mainstream political elites, also highlights the growing coalition of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans rallying around populist ideals. This moment is historic not just for the populist movement but also for the Kennedy family, known for their deep ties to numerous high-profile federal agencies.</p>\n<p>As Bannon emphasized during the interview, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not an anti-vaxxer. He is a critic of Big Pharma’s unchecked power and a staunch advocate for public health transparency and accountability. His recent endorsement of Donald Trump and the ensuing media storm only add to the ongoing debate about vaccine mandates, government overreach, and the role of powerful corporate interests in shaping public policy.</p>\n<p>Watch Part 1 and 2 of the 4 part series, from 2022 when RFK and Steve Bannon sat down for a long talk:</p>\n<h1>Robert F Kennedy Jr on WarRoom Steve Bannon- Part 1</h1>\n<h1>Robert F Kennedy Jr on WarRoom Steve Bannon- Part 2</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>U.S. Representative Andy Biggs and WarRoom host Peter Navarro opened the Friday WarRoom. They emphasized the crucial role of unity among Republicans and voter support in maintaining a strong and prosperous America. With the political landscape becoming increasingly polarized, Biggs discussed the necessity of a cohesive strategy prioritizing the nation’s well-being over partisan divides- or we all have to face the dangers of a lost American Republic.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I’m friends with a lot of other Republicans, and we have to find common ground to move forward together,” Biggs stated, underscoring the importance of collaboration within the party. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This strategy is about consolidating support across the Republican spectrum, from moderate conservatives to the more populist elements of the party.</p>\n<p>Biggs, a staunch conservative voice in Congress, highlighted Arizona’s economic successes under President Trump’s administration. He pointed out that Arizona’s economy thrived, with key sectors such as mining and aerospace significantly growing.</p>\n<p>However, he acknowledged that the current political climate in Arizona is changing. Kamala Harris’s presence on the Democratic ticket has temporarily shifted voter dynamics, narrowing Trump’s lead in the state, which is alarming.</p>\n<p>Despite this looming danger, Biggs remains optimistic, believing that many voters will ultimately recall the prosperity of the Trump era compared to the current administration’s struggles.</p>\n<p>A central theme in Biggs’ remarks was the significance of unity among Republicans, especially during these challenging times. He stressed that internal divisions could weaken the party’s overall effectiveness and potentially jeopardize their chances of success in crucial races.</p>\n<p>Biggs also discussed the broader implications of the Arizona presidential race, emphasizing its potential impact on U.S. Senate and Congressional races. He pointed out that Democrats heavily invest in campaigns to unseat Republicans like David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani.</p>\n<p>“The Democrats are spending a lot of money in these races, trying to flip Arizona,” he noted, highlighting the need for a robust and well-funded Republican response.</p>\n<p>In light of these challenges, Biggs stressed the importance of a winning strategy that resonates with voters’ primary concerns: the economy and border security. He argued that these issues are pivotal in Arizona and reflect broader national concerns that could sway voters across the country.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We need to focus on the issues that matter most to the American people,” Biggs said, advocating for a clear and consistent message that addresses voter priorities.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Biggs and Navarro also discussed the difficulties Republicans face in Senate races nationwide. Biggs noted the need for adequate funding and effective campaigning, particularly for candidates like Kari Lake, who represents a key opportunity for the party to secure a Senate seat. He emphasized that unity and strategic planning are essential for overcoming these obstacles and achieving electoral success.</p>\n<p>As the nation faces a pivotal moment in its history, Biggs’ call for unity among Republicans and his focus on voter priorities serve as a reminder of the importance of solidarity and purpose.</p>\n<p>By rallying around common goals and presenting a united front, Republicans can better position themselves to address the country’s pressing issues and secure a brighter future for all Americans.</p>\n<p>To hear more of the conversation, watch the whole 2 part interview from Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a charged episode of Battleground, Alex DeGrasse and his cohort of MAGA strategists—focused on mobilizing key demographics like gun owners and hunters and what sort of messaging needs to be used to persuade them to vote, like economics.</p>\n<p>Patrick Kester, Chief of Staff for Rep. Elise Stefanik and an ardent advocate for the Second Amendment, highlighted troubling statistics that reveal a significant portion of gun owners remain unregistered.</p>\n<p>According to Kester, there are over 10 million hunters and gun owners nationwide who have yet to register to vote. This untapped voter pool represents a critical opportunity for conservative mobilization, especially in swing states where these numbers could sway election outcomes.</p>\n<p>For example, Kester outlined specific figures:</p>\n<p>Arizona: 133,000 unregistered voters\nGeorgia: 350,000\nMichigan: 370,000\nMinnesota: 261,000\nPennsylvania: 515,000\nWisconsin: 338,000</p>\n<p>The strategy is straightforward yet vital: engage with these individuals through local gun clubs, ranges, and community networks to ensure they are registered and prepared to vote. This grassroots approach is seen as a way to not only increase voter turnout but also to counteract what some view as electoral manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>The Economic Angle: Voting with Your Wallet</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside the push for increased voter registration among gun owners, there was a notable emphasis on economic issues. The panelists discussed the need for voters to align their choices with their economic values. This involves more than just supporting candidates who advocate for the Second Amendment; it also means voting in a way that reflects a broader concern for economic policies and personal freedoms.</p>\n<p>Kester and Luke Mahoney, co-founder of Malko, urged listeners to consider the economic implications of their votes. Mahoney criticized recent Democratic policies as favoring government control over individual liberties and economic freedom. He argued that the current political climate, characterized by expansive government proposals, threatens both economic stability and personal rights.</p>\n<p>The discussion also touched on the broader implications of upcoming legislation and policy shifts, stressing that the fight is about gun rights and preserving a free-market economy. As such, voters are encouraged to evaluate candidates on their stance regarding the Second Amendment and their broader economic policies.</p>\n<p>The urgency of the conversation was clear: time is running out to register and mobilize voters. With early voting beginning in mid-September, the panel stressed that now is the time for action. They called for a concerted effort to reach out to gun owners, hunters, and other like-minded individuals to ensure they are registered and ready to cast their votes.</p>\n<p>Kester emphasized the need for grassroots activism, suggesting that even small efforts—like encouraging a few friends or family members to register—could have a substantial impact. The goal is to build a “tree effect,” where each individual encourages others, expanding the network of engaged voters.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s Battleground episode concluded with a rallying cry to the conservative base: engage with your community, mobilize your networks, and vote in alignment with your values. The panelists emphasized that every vote counts, especially in a polarized political landscape where margins can be razor-thin.</p>\n<p>By focusing on voter registration, economic awareness, and grassroots mobilization, the MAGA movement aims to harness these key demographics to secure electoral victories and advance their policy goals.</p>\n<p>Watch the full segment from Thursday:</p>\n<h1>Posse Needs To Make Big Push On Economic Messaging To Win The Presidency</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose talked to WarRoom host Ben Harnwell about each states’ critical role in maintaining election integrity and ensuring that only eligible voters participate in elections. LaRose emphasized the state’s responsibility in verifying voter eligibility and the steps Ohio takes to address this crucial issue before the November election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>LaRose began by addressing the core responsibility of state officials in managing voter rolls. \"Elections are clearly the state’s responsibility,” he stated. \"The law gives us as Secretary of State that responsibility, and the federal government doesn’t help us carry out that responsibility. And that’s really one of the big problems.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>LaRose’s comments reflect a frustration with the lack of federal assistance in this area, exposing the substantial burden placed on state-level authorities.</p>\n<p>LaRose also discussed the importance of communication with individuals whose citizenship status is in question.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"We send a round of mailings to them,” he explained. \"I said, listen, I want to know if you’re a citizen. Tell me if you’re not a citizen, please understand that you are risking being charged with a felony, which makes you subject to immediate deportation.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This direct approach prompts individuals to correct their registration status if necessary, reducing the risk of unauthorized voting.</p>\n<p>LaRose told Harnwell that Ohio has implemented a rigorous process to identify and remove non-citizens from the voter rolls to combat voter fraud and ensure compliance with legal requirements. LaRose explained, \"We are removing non-citizens from the voter rolls and actually referring them for prosecution because the law, that’s not followed, is not a law, it’s a suggestion.”</p>\n<p>This proactive approach demonstrates Ohio’s commitment to upholding electoral laws and maintaining the integrity of the voting system.</p>\n<p>The process of removing non-citizens from voter rolls involves several steps. Initially, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles served as a critical filter. When individuals apply for a state driver’s license or ID, their citizenship status is assessed. \"We use that with that,” LaRose said, referring to the department’s data, \"and we were able to remove hundreds of non-citizens from the voter rolls.”</p>\n<p>This initial step is crucial in identifying potential issues with voter eligibility.</p>\n<p>However, LaRose noted that the process is far from straightforward. \"The process is much harder than it needs to be because of lack of cooperation from the federal government,” he said.</p>\n<p>The challenge is compounded by the need to manually handle data and the fees associated with accessing federal databases. Despite these hurdles, LaRose’s office remains committed to the task, working through the complexities to ensure compliance with legal standards.</p>\n<p>Addressing criticisms of these efforts, LaRose countered that the goal is not voter suppression but adherence to legal requirements. \"We’re simply trying to establish who’s a citizen and who’s not,” he asserted. \"Ohio’s Constitution requires it, and federal law requires it.” His comments highlight the balance between enforcing legal standards and addressing public concerns about election integrity.</p>\n<p>As the November election approaches, LaRose’s efforts are about the critical role of state officials in safeguarding the electoral process. By ensuring that voter rolls are accurate and removing non-citizens, Ohio aims to uphold the integrity of its elections and reinforce public confidence in the system.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges and criticisms, LaRose’s commitment to this process reflects states’ essential responsibility in managing and securing the electoral process.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring La Rose:</p>\n<h1>OH Sec.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a stern warning on Thursday’s WarRoom about the potential for widespread voter fraud in the upcoming elections, driven by illegal immigration and the activities of specific non-profit organizations. Paxton told Harnwell he sounded the Warning Bell over what he had learned and said he hoped people would fight illegals voting now and not wait until after the election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We have to do what we can—right now. Do something now. Nothing can be stopped after the election,” he warned, adding: “The time to act is before the votes are cast, not after the results are in.” </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Paxton’s message to those considering voting illegally was equally direct: “You may try to vote in this election, but you may end up in prison for it.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Paxton, known for his unwavering stance on election integrity, expressed deep concern that the Biden administration’s policies deliberately undermine the integrity of the electoral process.</p>\n<p>Paxton began by recalling the Biden administration’s decision on day one to halt deportations, a move he believes sent a clear signal to the cartels and illegal immigrants: the United States would take care of them. “I was suspicious from the beginning when Joe Biden, on day one, announced he wouldn’t deport anybody. Like, why would you do that on day one? He wanted to signal to the cartels, get people here, and they don’t have to run anymore; we’ll take care of them,” Paxton remarked. He suggested that this was not just an act of humanitarianism but part of a broader strategy to alter the demographics of key states to benefit the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>According to Paxton, one of the most alarming aspects of this strategy is the role of non-profit organizations in registering voters. He pointed out that these organizations have been actively involved in voter registration drives on state property, particularly at motor vehicle departments.</p>\n<p>“We started becoming suspicious when we saw these non-profits were out on big police property where they register people for driver’s licenses. And people get registered to vote using a normal process. We were curious. It’s already giving you your driver’s license. You can automatically register.  Why would you need another special non-profit group registering people unless the people being registered outside are not qualified to be registered inside?” Paxton asked, highlighting the suspicious nature of these activities. His office is still investigating the full extent of these efforts, but the implications are troubling.</p>\n<p>Paxton did not mince words when he spoke of the broader plan behind these actions. He believes that the Obama-Biden administration, unable to win elections legitimately, has orchestrated a scheme to use illegal immigrants and fraudulent voting practices to secure electoral victories.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I’m sounding the warning bell now,” Paxton declared. “This is happening all over the country. This was a plan by the Obama-Biden regime to bring in people to vote because they can’t win elections without some of these illegal voting schemes that they put together, including mail-in ballots, which they did last time.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Paxton’s message was clear: this is not a localized issue but a nationwide threat to the integrity of American democracy.</p>\n<p>Paxton emphasized the urgency of addressing this issue before it is too late. His words serve as both a deterrent and a call to action, urging all who care about the country’s future to take these threats seriously and act immediately to safeguard the integrity of the upcoming elections.</p>\n<p>For more, watch the full segment with Paxton’s warnings and advice about what to do:</p>\n<h1>BREAKING: Texas AG Paxton Launches Investigation Into Biden Regime Registering Illegal Immigrants</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Wednesday, political analyst and pollster Mark Mitchell and WarRoom host Peter Navarro explored the intricacies of Rasmussen polling data and its implications for the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Their conversation highlighted significant contrasts between polling organizations and the evolving political dynamics over the past four years.</p>\n<p>Mitchell took aim at corporate- mainstream polling firms, specifically criticizing 538 for alleged methodological biases. “538 is owned by ABC News, which rolls up to Disney,” Mitchell stated, arguing that the aggregator’s approach has shifted to align with particular narratives. He contended that, unlike 538, Real Clear Politics offers a more transparent view of the polling landscape.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Real Clear Politics is a straight average and they link you to the Cross tabs and they have standards about what polls they put on there,” he said, contrasting this with 538’s \"black box prediction model” that he believes distorts public perception.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mitchell criticized the treatment of his polling data by major aggregators like 538, which he claims have acted unfairly toward his work. According to Mitchell, 538,  has shown bias in their reporting and even threatened to exclude his polls from their aggregation. He said, “I think they’ve kicked us out quite frankly. I think that’s the reason.” Mitchell expressed frustration that his polling data, which he believes offers a more accurate picture of the electorate, is not being fairly represented by these aggregators.</p>\n<p>Mitchell contrasted his methodology with that of 538, arguing that 538’s models are opaque and designed to drive narratives, while his own approach aims for maximum transparency. He emphasized that his polling is grounded in straightforward, consistent methodologies without selective adjustments: “I didn’t change anything… I’m basically trying to match what I think an accurate picture of the electorate is.”</p>\n<p>This critique exposes a broader debate about polling accuracy and transparency. Mitchell’s data suggests that Kamala Harris’s approval ratings have been largely stagnant despite media portrayals of rising support. \"Kamala Harris’s numbers have been stagnating around 44-45%, contrary to media reports of improvement,” Mitchell noted.</p>\n<p>His skepticism extends to manipulating polling methodologies, alleging that some organizations adjust their methods to achieve desired outcomes. He specifically pointed to recent admissions by polling firms about over-sampling certain demographics, which he believes distorts the true picture of public opinion.</p>\n<p>The discussion also ventured into the shifting political landscape compared to the 2020 election. Mitchell highlighted that while Trump’s numbers are competitive, they vary significantly across different battleground states. “Trump is roughly tied within the margin of error in states like Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania,” he explained.</p>\n<p>This variation indicates a more volatile electoral environment than in previous cycles. Despite some recent polling suggesting tighter races, Mitchell observed a notable improvement in Trump’s standing compared to four years ago. “Trump’s performance is better compared to 2020, showing a significant pickup in key states,” he emphasized.</p>\n<p>This improvement, however, comes with caveats. Mitchell noted that while Trump’s current position is stronger than before, discrepancies remain in certain states. For instance, in Arizona, where Trump’s numbers are not as favorable as they were four years ago, he suggested that methodological issues might be at play.</p>\n<p>“I think I got a pretty left sample in Arizona that didn’t fully get weighted out,” he speculated, reflecting concerns over the accuracy of state-level polling.</p>\n<p>In addition to polling discrepancies, the conversation highlighted the shifting priorities of voters. According to Mitchell, economic issues continue to dominate voter concerns, with “38% of voters in Nevada prioritizing the economy, while only 16% consider immigration a top issue.”</p>\n<p>This shift. According to Mitchell, shows the enduring significance of economic factors in shaping electoral outcomes, despite other issues like immigration and government corruption also playing roles.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s insights provide a critical perspective on the evolving dynamics of the 2024 election. His scrutiny of polling methodologies and emphasis on economic issues reveal a complex and shifting electoral landscape, challenging conventional narratives and highlighting the need for careful analysis of polling data.</p>\n<p>As the election approaches, these insights offer a glimpse into the factors influencing voter behavior and electoral outcomes.</p>\n<p>For more from Mitchell, watch this segment from Wednesday’s WarRoom discussion:</p>\n<h1>Rasmussen Reports on Kamala’s Polling Falling Behind President Trump</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Dr. Ben Carson issued a powerful call to Christians from the WarRoom on Tuesday, urging them to shine their light on the current political darkness and fulfill their duty by voting against forces undermining moral values and freedom. Carson’s message was clear: Christians cannot afford to remain passive or indifferent in this pivotal moment for our nation.</p>\n<p>Carson began by reflecting on the foundational principles set forth by the Founding Fathers, particularly John Adams, who famously said that the U.S. Constitution was “designed for moral and religious people” and was inadequate for any other.</p>\n<p>This principle underscores Carson’s argument that the moral fabric of the country is at risk if Christians fail to engage in the political process. “We seem to have a leadership now that is inconsistent with Christian morality,” Carson observed, highlighting issues like abortion and transgender rights as areas where current policies conflict with Christian values.</p>\n<p>The core of Carson’s argument revolves around the need for Christians to act decisively in the face of moral and ideological threats. He criticized the tendency among some Evangelicals to abstain from voting out of dissatisfaction with certain candidates, likening this to preferring a surgeon with poor bedside manner who saves lives over one with a pleasant demeanor who fails. Carson’s analogy emphasizes the importance of prioritizing effectiveness and moral alignment over personal preferences. “At some point, you have to use that tremendous brain God gave you,” he urged, recognizing the need to make pragmatic choices that align with Christian principles.</p>\n<p>Carson also addressed concerns from non-religious individuals about the frequent focus on religion in political discussions. He countered by framing the debate as one of fundamental logic and freedom rather than solely religious doctrine. “Does it make sense to be able to express yourself the way you want to? Does it make sense to have a traditional nuclear family and pass on values to your children?” Carson asked, stressing that these values are under threat from Marxist ideologies that seek to replace traditional family structures with state control. He cited the 1963 Congressional Record’s list of communist goals, which included driving wedges between children and their parents—a strategy to ensure long-term ideological control.</p>\n<p>The heart of Carson’s message is a call to action. He emphasized that Christians must not only be aware of these threats but actively counteract them. “We need to get up and become active,” he said, advocating for increased voter engagement and public discourse. Carson implored Christians to break the traditional taboo against discussing politics and religion in public, advocating for transparency and awareness to combat the left’s agenda. “Shine the light,” he declared, underscoring the need to expose and challenge the darkness of ideological subversion.</p>\n<p>Dr. Carson’s message to Christians is a challenge and a call to responsibility. By voting and engaging in public discourse, Christians can help preserve the nation’s moral foundation and ensure that the values they cherish continue to guide the country. The time for passive observation is over; it is now a moment for action. As Carson poignantly stated, failing to act is not just an oversight but a dereliction of duty to uphold the principles of freedom and moral integrity.</p>\n<p>For more on why Christians need to vote, watch the entire WarRoom interview between Dr. Ben Carson and Dave Brat from Tuesday:</p>\n<h1>Ben Carson On The Kamala/Walz Democratic Ticket</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Tuesday, Dave Brat and Ralph Reed did their best to reach Christian voters, who could play an essential role in the upcoming election. They stressed that their involvement could decisively alter the political landscape. With a focus on mobilizing the faith community, Reed and Brat highlighted the stark contrast between the candidates on moral and freedom issues, urging Christians to leverage their collective power to effect change.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Reed emphasized the gravity of the election, noting, \"I can’t recall an election where the gap and the chasm separating the two major party nominees on the moral issues that burn in the hearts and give meaning to the souls of tens of millions of Americans are in sharper contrast.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The statistics are compelling. Reed highlighted that the number of Evangelical Christians voting increased from 24 million in 2016 to 35 million in 2020, a testament to the impact of grassroots mobilization.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"We’re projecting we can add another 10 to 12 million Evangelical voters this time,” Reed asserted. He encouraged every Christian to contribute to this effort, whether by canvassing, making phone calls, or spreading the word.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He praised former President Donald Trump for his unwavering pro-life stance, judicial appointments, and advocacy for religious freedom, citing his pivotal role in appointing three Supreme Court justices who upheld religious liberty in landmark cases.</p>\n<p>Conversely, Reed criticized Kamala Harris, describing her as \"the most liberal, San Francisco, left-wing radical nominee ever put forward by a major party,” with little regard for the Judeo-Christian values that many Americans hold dear. He pointed out her and her running mate’s past actions against religious freedoms, like their support for restricting church gatherings during the pandemic. \"The fact that they thought it was more important to open stores than churches tells you all you need to know about this ticket,” Reed remarked, highlighting a fundamental difference in how each candidate views religious freedom.</p>\n<p>Brat and Reed’s discussion took a motivational turn as Reed detailed the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s ambitious plan to mobilize voters. \"We will knock on 10 million doors and reach 17 to 18 million Evangelical and pro-life Roman Catholic voters at their homes between now and November 5th,” Reed announced. This massive outreach effort aims to engage voters directly, emphasizing personal connections over impersonal digital campaigns.</p>\n<p>Reed urged Christians to move beyond passive support and actively participate in the election process. \"We have to put feet to our prayers,” he said. \"We can’t just yell at the television set. We’ve got to go out and knock on doors, call voters, and educate them on the issues.” He stressed that grassroots efforts, rather than media narratives or poll predictions, will be crucial in determining the election’s outcome.</p>\n<p>As Reed concluded, \"The polls are irrelevant. The pundits are irrelevant. The press is irrelevant. It’s all about the grassroots.” He called on all Americans who value freedom and constitutional principles to unite in this pivotal election, underscoring that their combined efforts can indeed change the course of history.</p>\n<p>With the power of the Christian vote and grassroots activism, this election can be a defining moment for the nation’s future. It’s time to step up, make your voice heard, and be a part of the movement that shapes the direction of our country.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire interview featuring Ralph Reed:</p>\n<h1>Reed On Mass Evangelical Mobilization Effort To Get 17 MILLION New Evangelical Voters Out For Trump</h1>\n</div>\n"

Andy Biggs (R-AZ) discussed the explosive findings from the Comer Committee, which revealed troubling details about the Biden family’s financial entanglements with foreign entities.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Brat emphasized the importance of voter turnout for November’s elections, stating, “It is incumbent upon us to give hope to people, to get them to go and vote.” He stressed that the future of the Republic hinges on the electorate’s response to these issues.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The discussion focused on how Joe Biden allegedly traded on his name and influence for financial gain during his time as vice president and beyond, raising serious questions about corruption at the highest levels of government.</p>\n<p>According to Biggs, the report shows that the Biden family received substantial payouts from multiple countries, including China and Russia.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> “For literally years, Joe Biden, when he was Vice President, between offices, and even as President, his family was trading on his name and access,” Biggs explained. “The money was flowing to the Bidens, and they were just selling a brand. They had no services. Joe Biden was the brand. The Joe Biden lift. They were selling Joe Biden, and that is corruption.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Biggs highlighted specific instances, such as payments from the former mayor of Moscow’s wife, one of the richest women in Russia, who funneled millions to the Bidens. These payments were allegedly facilitated by Joe Biden himself, who participated in meetings and phone calls with these foreign actors, thereby closing the deals. The report suggests that this pattern was repeated with other countries, including China, where Hunter Biden reportedly secured over a billion dollars to manage after traveling there with his father on Air Force Two.</p>\n<p>The discussion also turned to the implications of these revelations for the upcoming 2024 election and the need for accountability.</p>\n<p>Biggs expressed frustration over the lack of consequences for the Biden family, noting that while impeachment articles have been filed by various Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, there isn’t enough support within Congress to move forward decisively. “I want to give hope and truth,” Biggs said. “When we get back in, we will need to get the real impeachment trial against Joe Biden.” However, he also voiced a concern, adding, “I am worried that they are going to say that we don’t have the time, so we need more conservatives because we do not have the votes right now.”</p>\n<p>Brat echoed this sentiment, pointing to the need for more conservative representation in Washington to ensure that the necessary steps can be taken. “Even after finding $30 million, we don’t have the votes right now. We need more conservatives in D.C.,” he said.</p>\n<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Brat and Biggs have stressed the importance of the America First movement, urging voters to stay informed, engaged, and ready to take action at the ballot box.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The stakes have never been higher,” Brat concluded, “and it’s up to us to make sure our voices are heard and our Republic is preserved.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Dave Bratt and Andy Biggs:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>As the 2024 election approaches, concerns over election integrity are reaching a fever pitch. Joe Hoft, a seasoned auditor with extensive experience in global financial audits, has sounded the alarm on what he sees as a critical need for transparency and accountability in the U.S. electoral process. In a recent discussion with Ben Harnwell, Hoft laid out his strategy for safeguarding the upcoming election, drawing on his professional background to underscore the situation’s urgency.</p>\n<p>Hoft’s deep concern stems from what he views as significant flaws in the 2020 election, which he controversially describes as “the steal.”</p>\n<p><strong>Reflecting on the process, he argued, “The 2020 election never should have been certified, and therefore, it was stolen. We accepted fraud and wrongdoing, something we would never tolerate in the corporate world.”</strong></p>\n<p>With decades of auditing experience, including in countries like China, Hoft brings a unique perspective to the table. “I’ve done audits in places like China, where they handed me everything I asked for. But our elections right now are not certifiable because we can’t get our hands on all the necessary information,” he explained. This stark comparison highlights the lack of transparency and cooperation that Hoft believes plagues the U.S. election system.</p>\n<p>Hoft’s approach to the 2024 election revolves around a meticulous strategy to “validate and reconcile the ballots,” ensuring that every vote is legitimate. Drawing from his auditing expertise, he emphasized the need for thorough checks and balances akin to those required in the corporate world. ”</p>\n<p>“When you finish a financial audit, you bring in an external monitor to sign off on it. You provide them everything they ask for, without exception,” Hoft said, stressing that the same rigor should be applied to the electoral process.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, Hoft and a coalition of groups, including True the Vote and United Sovereign Americans, are working tirelessly to implement measures that would make the election process more transparent and secure. One key focus is cleaning up voter rolls, a task that Hoft praises local Patriots for tackling effectively. “Voter rolls are one way to ensure election integrity. People like Chris Jersey with People’s Audit have been crucial in this effort, forwarding reports that identified inaccuracies in the voter rolls and working with local officials to correct them,” Hoft noted.</p>\n<p>However, Hoft is quick to acknowledge the scale of the challenge. “We’ve got one hell of a task ahead of us,” he said. He pointed out that of the roughly 500 controls necessary to ensure a fair election, only about a third are currently in place. This, he argues, puts the U.S. at a significant disadvantage heading into 2024.</p>\n<p>Hoft’s solution is straightforward but ambitious: a grassroots effort to monitor and validate every single paper ballot. He cited a recent international election in which opposition groups were able to effectively challenge the results by securing copies of 80 percent of the ballots.</p>\n<p>“If they can do it, so can we,” Hoft asserted. He called for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of observers across the country to ensure that “not a single ballot is entered into this election that isn’t legit.”</p>\n<p><strong>Despite the daunting nature of the task, Hoft remains resolute. He urged collaboration among all groups dedicated to election integrity, insisting that “we can win, but the task is high.”</strong></p>\n<p>His message is clear: the stakes are too significant to ignore, and the time to act is now. “We’re not going to let them certify another pile of garbage. That’s not the American way, and we shouldn’t accept it,” Hoft concluded.</p>\n<p>Hoft’s professional insights and unwavering commitment to electoral integrity make it clear that the fight for a fair election is far from over.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: Hoft’s site is at, <a href=\"https://fate2024.org/\">Fair and Transparent Elections 2024 group</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full interview featuring Joe Hoft:</p>\n<h1>Hoft: “Guard, Validate, And Reconcile” Ballots Is Best Strategy For 2024</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a scathing critique on Monday’s WarRoom,  host Peter Navarro took aim at Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris’s economic policies, highlighting her missteps in a biting analysis that exposes the irony and foolishness of her actions. As the 2024 presidential election looms, Navarro didn’t hold back in pointing out how Harris’s policy decisions, particularly her approach to inflation and price controls, have exacerbated the very problems she now seeks to solve.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“You broke it, you bought it,” Navarro declared, using the famous adage to encapsulate Harris’s predicament. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As the second-in-command and potential presidential candidate, Harris finds herself in a position where she must now fix the economic issues she helped create. According to Navarro, her record is marred by mistakes that could haunt her campaign, starting with her mishandling of inflation.</p>\n<p>Navarro began by lampooning Harris’s recent speech in which she repeatedly mentioned her commitment to passing a federal ban on “price gauging,” a term she confusingly used instead of “price gouging.” \"Even if you don’t have a PhD in economics,” Navarro quipped, \"it’s hilarious… I mean, what the hell does ‘price gauging’ even mean?” This blunder, he argued, highlighted Harris’s lack of understanding of basic economic concepts.</p>\n<p>According to Navarro, Harris’s proposal for price controls is emblematic of her failure to grasp the consequences of such policies. \"Price controls don’t work,” he stated bluntly. \"In Kamala’s supermarket of the future, there just won’t be enough eggs and meat to buy.” Navarro warned that this isn’t just economic folly; it’s political suicide. He equated her strategy to a \"hat trick” of errors, linking it to \"first-world communism, California liberalism, and third-world Venezuelan socialism.”</p>\n<p>But Navarro didn’t stop at ridiculing her economic acumen. He criticized Harris’s role in passing two major spending bills that he blames for fueling inflation: the 2021 $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and the 2022 $740 billion Inflation Reduction Act. \"Whenever I say ‘Inflation Reduction Act,’ I get like this,” Navarro remarked, feigning discomfort. \"It’s Orwellian to call what they did the Inflation Reduction Act when it should have been called the Inflation on Steroids Act.”</p>\n<p>The irony, Navarro noted, is that Harris cast the tie-breaking votes for these bills as President of the Senate, making her directly responsible for much of the current economic woes. \"As the sign in the pottery store says: you broke it, you bought it,” he reiterated.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s critique also extended to Harris’s overall policy record, including her handling of the border crisis, energy issues, and crime. He dubbed her the \"fracking queen of Pennsylvania” and the \"defunding-the-police princess of San Francisco.” According to Navarro, Harris’s failures in these areas are equally damaging and compound her \"you broke it, you bought it” problem.</p>\n<p>Navarro concluded by noting the profound irony in Harris’s situation. She now faces the unenviable task of running for president while trying to convince voters that she can solve problems she helped create. \"To win,” Navarro advised, \"Harris must promise voters she will fix every problem that she herself has helped create.” However, with economic indicators like inflation, housing costs, and gas prices all rising under her watch, Navarro suggested that Harris’s chances of making this case convincingly are slim.</p>\n<p>In a final jab, Navarro warned that Harris’s economic gaffes, particularly her \"price gauging” remark, would be ripe for exploitation by her political opponents. \"Donald Trump is chomping at the bit to tag her with it,” he predicted. The former president, who delivered four years of \"near zero inflation, rising real wages, and stable growth,” would, in Navarro’s view, relish the opportunity to contrast his record with Harris’s economic missteps.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the opening segments from Monday’s WarRoom with host, Peter Navarro:</p>\n<h1>Dr. Navarro: Kamala’s \"Price-Gauging” Gaffe Exposed</h1>\n<h1>\"You Break It, You Buy It”: Dr. Navarro Calls Out Kamala For Running From Her Crises</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In late June, Steve Bannon delivered a powerful and inspirational message to his WarRoom audience, calling on Americans from all walks of life to rise up and reclaim their historic civil rights. As he prepared to surrender to a federal correctional facility in Danbury, Connecticut, Bannon was not just a political strategist; he was a prisoner and a leader of a movement—one that has reshaped the political landscape in Washington, D.C., and beyond.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“You’re being abused by a system that is set up to take 60-65 percent of everything you make in taxes, fees… and spend it on things that don’t help you” Bannon said during that June program.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon’s WarRoom has become more than just a program; it is a rallying point for millions of Americans who feel marginalized by the elites and the established order. His daily speeches inspire, empower, and direct people to take their citizenship seriously, particularly when the media and government actors seek to diminish the power of the average American.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Action, action, action,” Bannon often repeats, urging his listeners to get involved in civic activism. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>His message resonates across the spectrum, from wealthy to working-class Americans, who are concerned about protecting their civil rights—rights that include representation in government, equal justice, equal opportunity, and the freedoms of religion and speech.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s reflections on the movement he helped build are deeply personal and reflect many Americans’ deep discontent. In the clip, Bannon refers to events in Las Vegas and Detroit, where he spent time talking to people.</p>\n<p>“The most powerful thing I took away from those conversations was not just your level of information,” Bannon said, acknowledging his audience’s depth of knowledge and commitment, adding:</p>\n<p>“But the most important thing was how many people came up and said, ‘Watching the show changed their lives.'”</p>\n<p>For Bannon, this movement is about more than just politics; it is about giving people a purpose and a role in shaping their country’s future, he said. He proudly recounted stories on that program of people who had become precinct committee members, county supervisors, and state party delegates. “I’m now a protagonist,” he quoted one of his followers, emphasizing that people are no longer passive observers but active drivers of change.</p>\n<p>Central to Bannon’s message is his unwavering support for President Donald Trump. He sees Trump as the figurehead of this populist movement, a man who has taken the fight to the elites and put the average American “in the room” and “at the head of the table.”</p>\n<p>Bannon believes that Trump’s success lies in his ability to transcend his class and become a “class traitor” to the system that benefits the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.</p>\n<p>“The commonality is you’re not at the table,” Bannon stated bluntly, describing how the system has been designed to exclude ordinary people.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s message is one of empowerment. He reminds his audience that this movement isn’t about him, Tucker Carlson, or even President Trump—it’s about them. “Next Man Up” is the mantra, a call to every American to step forward and take their place in the fight for their rights.</p>\n<p>As Steve Bannon serves his sentence, his voice and vision continue to inspire those who believe in the power of the people. His words echo across the nation, urging Americans to stand up, get involved, and reclaim their rights in the face of a system that seeks to silence them.</p>\n<p>Some WarRoom resources from recent clips:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/day-of-action-to-crush-kamala-how-you-can-make-a-difference-in-the-2024-elections-according-to-jenny-beth-martin/\">Day of Action to Crush Kamala, How You Can Make a Difference in the 2024 Elections According to Jenny Beth Martin</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/rallying-the-rust-belt-grassroots-activism-and-the-fight-to-secure-americas-future-matt-boyle-in-the-warroom/\"> Rallying the Rust Belt: Grassroots Activism and the Fight to Secure America’s Future, Matt Boyle in the WarRoom</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/call-to-action-securing-trumps-victory-calls-for-grassroots-action-and-vigilance-in-georgia-from-salleigh-grubbs/\">CALL TO ACTION!

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Saturday morning WarRoom discussion between Maureen Bannon and Royce White, the spotlight was on a disgraceful display of triumph by the Taliban—a military parade flaunting U.S. military equipment left behind in Afghanistan. The parade, held to commemorate the fall of Kabul three years ago, stands as a profound humiliation for U.S. leadership, highlighting the catastrophic failures of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>\n<p>Bannon, drawing from her extensive experience, voiced her disgust at the sight of Taliban fighters parading with American-made gear.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"It’s absolutely disgusting to see the Taliban flaunting billions of dollars worth of equipment that we left behind,” Bannon declared.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon’s critique extends to Democrat Presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, who has been positioned as the \"last person in the room” during crucial decisions related to the withdrawal. Bannon’s frustration with Harris is palpable: \"The fact that Kamala Harris was not the last person in the room and she felt confident about the decision tells you right there she was not qualified to be the commander-in-chief.” This criticism underscores broader concerns about Harris’s competence and the administration’s overall approach to foreign policy and military engagements.</p>\n<p>Her sentiments reflect a deep frustration shared by many veterans and observers who view the withdrawal from Afghanistan as a colossal failure in military and political strategy.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal has been widely criticized, with Bannon emphasizing the sheer recklessness involved.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"We left Bagram Airfield in the middle of the night, and equipment was left behind either damaged or operable,” Bannon noted. This bungled withdrawal, she argues, is not just a strategic blunder but a betrayal of the sacrifices made by U.S. service members.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The spectacle of the Taliban’s parade, showcasing abandoned American equipment, is more than just an operational failure; it’s a symbolic victory lap that mocks the United States’ efforts and undermines its credibility on the global stage. Bannon highlights this issue as a glaring example of the administration’s mishandling. \"If any of us misappropriated or lost $90 billion worth of equipment, we’d be brought up on charges,” she stated. The lack of accountability for the disastrous withdrawal is seen as emblematic of a broader failure in leadership and governance.</p>\n<p>Here is a bit of the parade featuring US Military equipment:</p>\n<p>Bannon’s insights are informed by her own experiences in the military, contrasting sharply with the administration’s actions. Having been part of the withdrawal from Iraq, she underscores the importance of a well-executed exit strategy. \"In Iraq, we managed the withdrawal by sending equipment home or transferring it to the Iraqi Army,” Bannon explained. The contrast with the Afghanistan withdrawal, which she describes as a \"logistical failure,” accentuates the severity of the missteps made by the Biden-Harris team.</p>\n<p>This discussion serves as a stark reminder to voters of the ramifications of poor leadership and decision-making. In Bannon’s view, the Taliban’s military parade is a \"smack in the face” to U.S. leadership, exposing a failure to safeguard American interests and properly execute military strategy. As Bannon pointedly remarks, \"We should have brought all those weapons home, and this parade is the result of that catastrophic error.”</p>\n<p>The Taliban’s parade is not just a symbol of their victory but a glaring indictment of the current administration’s failure to uphold American values and protect its interests. The Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal has not only embarrassed the U.S. on the world stage but has also cast serious doubt on the capabilities of its leaders, particularly Kamala Harris.</p>\n<p>As Maureen Bannon’s critique illustrates, this moment demands accountability and reflection on the future direction of U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Watch the full WarRoom segment with Maureen Bannon for more context:</p>\n<h1>CPT Maureen Bannon: Kamala’s Botched Withdrawal “Created 13 Gold Star Families”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a provocative discussion on the WarRoom, Raynard Jackson, Chairman of Black Americans for a Better Future, passionately defended President Donald Trump’s policies, arguing that they offer crucial support for Black entrepreneurs and challenge the failures of liberal agendas. Jackson, known for his staunch conservative stance, framed Trump’s approach as a necessary corrective to systemic issues affecting the Black community.</p>\n<p>Jackson’s critique extends to the broader impact of liberal governance on Black cities and communities. He highlighted the persistent issues of crime and economic decline in cities led by Black mayors, pointing out that these problems persist despite these leaders’ high-profile political positions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"There ain’t a Black mayor city in the entire country, where Black people are flourishing,” Jackson stated, underscoring his belief that liberal policies have failed to address the root causes of these challenges.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Royce White, the host of Saturday’s WarRoom program, added to the critique of liberal policies from the organization and was blunt. He criticized organizations like the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), labeling them as \"bourgeois” and detached from the real issues facing Black Americans.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"Trump did a masterful job” in confronting these groups, Jackson declared, drawing a parallel to Bill Clinton’s 1992 \"Sister Souljah” moment, where Clinton distanced himself from radical elements to appeal to moderate voters. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jackson saw Trump’s actions as a strategic maneuver to demonstrate his independence from liberal black organizations that, in his view, hinder conservative values within the Black community, just as he had reported in his latest WarRoom contribution on the issue: <a href=\"https://warroom.org/the-national-association-of-black-journalists-continue-to-prove-their-irrelevance/\">The National Association of Black Journalists Continue to Prove Their Irrelevance</a></p>\n<p>Central to Jackson’s argument on Saturday is his support for Trump’s policies aimed at empowering Black and minority entrepreneurs. He emphasized that conservative policies offer a lifeline to Black business owners, who are often stifled by bureaucratic regulations. \"</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The number one thing the Trump campaign and MAGA needs to do is to be the same with Black entrepreneurs,” Jackson asserted. He believes that removing government impediments and fostering an environment that supports business creation are essential for economic growth and job creation within the Black community.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jackson criticized liberal promises of government aid, such as down payment assistance for first-time homeowners, arguing that these measures undermine self-reliance and personal achievement. \"Whatever happened to sweat equity? Now, the government wants to give you a down payment for a free house,” he said, suggesting that such policies perpetuate dependency rather than encourage self-sufficiency.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Jackson views Trump’s policies as a means to disrupt the status quo and offer real opportunities for Black Americans. He praised Trump for taking a stand against what he perceives as the failures of the Democratic Party and its associated institutions. \"Trump’s maneuver was a strategic move to show that liberal black organizations would not influence him,” Jackson argued, framing Trump’s approach as a bold departure from the ineffective strategies of previous administrations.</p>\n<p>Jackson’s support for Trump is rooted in a belief that conservative principles align more closely with the needs of Black entrepreneurs and the broader community. He argues that Trump’s policies create an environment where Black business owners can thrive by removing regulatory barriers and promoting self-reliance.</p>\n<p>\"We don’t need the government help. We don’t want the government help. Get the heck out of our way,” Jackson asserted, positioning Trump’s agenda as a necessary corrective to the overreach of liberal policies.</p>\n<p>Jackson’s endorsement of Trump’s policies reflects a broader critique of liberal approaches and an embrace of conservative strategies that he believes will foster economic growth and self-sufficiency within the Black community. His arguments challenge prevailing narratives and highlight a stark ideological divide in the discourse surrounding Black empowerment and entrepreneurial success.</p>\n<p>To hear more of the discussion between Jackson and White, watch the entire Saturday WarRoom segments featuring Raynard Jackson:</p>\n<h1>Jackson: The #1 Thing The Trump Campaign And MAGA Needs To Do Is To Be Seen With Black Entrepreneurs</h1>\n<h1>Raynard Jackson On President Trump NABJ Interview: “He Hit It Out Of The Ballpark”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In his latest address on War Room, Royce White issued a stark warning about the state of American freedom and the role of personal responsibility in addressing systemic issues. Centered around the concept of \"wage slavery,” White argued that many Americans have become subjugated by a system of economic imperialism that undermines their true liberties.</p>\n<p>According to White, the essence of modern economic oppression lies in the manipulation of citizens’ priorities:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"You have strategically intentionally methodically been made serfs, wage slaves.” He suggested that this economic manipulation is a fundamental aspect of a broader cultural and political decay, one that has been exacerbated by what he described as a Marxist cultural revolution. White pointedly criticized how economic pressures have caused many to prioritize their jobs over their civic responsibilities: \"The average American citizen prizes their job more important than their civic duty. There’s nothing American about that.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>His comments critique current societal conditions and a call to action for those who wish to reclaim their autonomy and civic responsibility.</p>\n<p>White began by addressing the audience’s everyday challenges, acknowledging the reality of modern life:</p>\n<p>\"We have jobs. We have families. We have obligations, we have responsibilities.” He recognized that while people have passions outside of politics, these personal commitments should not detract from their civic duties.</p>\n<p>However, he argued that many Americans have become \"wage slaves” due to a deliberate economic system designed to keep them in servitude.</p>\n<p>White’s analysis extends beyond merely critiquing the situation; he also offers actionable advice for those disillusioned by the state of affairs. He challenged the notion that participating in elections is a burdensome or insignificant task: \"All you got to do is show up one day on a Tuesday for a United States primary end. We’re going to do it again in November.” White emphasized the ease of voting compared to the larger stakes involved, framing it as a minimal yet crucial action in the fight against systemic issues.</p>\n<p>He further underscored the importance of active engagement by comparing it to a sports analogy:</p>\n<p>\"You don’t practice shooting any extra time… you should expect to miss.” This metaphor illustrates that without diligent effort in political participation, individuals should not be surprised by unfavorable outcomes. White encouraged Americans to take their civic responsibilities seriously, suggesting they should not merely complain about their situation but actively work to change it.</p>\n<p>White also addressed those who may feel overwhelmed by the scope of their responsibilities, stating:</p>\n<p>\"I’m not asking you to go off the grid and throw your electronics away.” He made it clear that he was not advocating for extreme measures but rather for a basic level of involvement, including voting and possibly taking on roles such as election judges or participating in grassroots efforts like door-to-door canvassing.</p>\n<p>In his critique of the current political establishment, White expressed frustration with the status quo, which he described as perpetuating \"death and debt.” He praised Donald Trump for challenging this status quo, even while acknowledging that Trump is far from perfect. White’s call to action was clear: Americans must actively engage in the political process to challenge and change the prevailing economic and political control systems.</p>\n<p>White’s comments on War Room highlight the deep-seated issues of economic oppression and the critical need for civic engagement. By framing citizens as \"wage slaves” and emphasizing the importance of political participation, White provides both a critique of the current system and practical advice for those seeking to reclaim their freedoms.</p>\n<p>His call is not just for awareness but for action, urging Americans to prioritize their civic duties and take tangible steps to address their systemic challenges.</p>\n<p>Watch the full segment from Saturday’s WarRoom to hear more:</p>\n<h1>Royce White On How Minnesota Became The Cultural Battleground For This Election Cycle</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a passionate Saturday morning WarRoom segment, Royce White, a former NBA player turned political candidate, defended himself against recent criticisms and expanded on his vision for America’s future.</p>\n<p>Known for his outspoken views and unfiltered rhetoric, White, who secured the Republican nomination this week to run for US Senate, addressed allegations that he made derogatory remarks about women, explicitly referring to some women as being “mouthy.”</p>\n<p>White quickly addressed the controversy surrounding his comments about women. He acknowledged that his words had been misinterpreted by some, but he stood by his original statement, insisting that his criticism was not about gender but about ideology.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“When I said some women are getting mouthy, I wasn’t talking about all women. I was talking about those who are out here pushing Marxism and Communism, trying to destroy the very fabric of our nation,” White explained. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He emphasized that his concern is with the growing influence of these ideologies, which he believes are antithetical to American values like freedom and liberty.</p>\n<p><strong>QUESTION: IS WHITE WRONG?  ANSWER: NO-WHITE IS NOT WRONG. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONSIDER THIS: </strong></p>\n<p>While it would be overly simplistic to claim that the Marxist-Communist movement is exclusively dominated by progressive women, there are certain factors that contribute to the perception that women, particularly those with progressive views, have a significant presence in leftist activism.</p>\n<p><strong>Representation in Progressive Movements:</strong> Women have historically played prominent roles in various progressive movements, including those advocating for social justice, labor rights, and economic equality. Figures like Angela Davis, who is both a feminist and a Marxist, have become symbols of the intersection between gender and leftist ideology. Today, many women are at the forefront of movements that promote economic redistribution, racial justice, and environmental sustainability—ideas that align with Marxist and Communist principles.</p>\n<p><strong>Academic Influence:</strong> In academia, women scholars have contributed significantly to the development of Marxist and leftist theory. Feminist-Marxist thinkers often analyze the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy, arguing that economic systems exploit both class and gender. This intellectual framework has influenced progressive activism and has helped integrate gender issues into broader Marxist critiques of capitalism.</p>\n<p><strong>Visibility in Activism:</strong> Progressive women are often highly visible in grassroots activism. Movements such as Black Lives Matter (co-founded by women) and various feminist organizations have adopted rhetoric that critiques capitalism, imperialism, and systemic inequality—core concerns of Marxist and Communist thought. Although these movements are not exclusively Marxist, they incorporate elements of Marxist theory in their critiques of the current socio-economic system.</p>\n<p><strong>Media Portrayal:</strong> The media often highlights the involvement of progressive women in left-leaning activism, which can create a perception of female dominance in these movements. Women are frequently showcased as leaders and spokespersons in social justice movements, which may contribute to the notion that progressive women are driving the Marxist and Communist agenda.</p>\n<p><strong>Intersectionality:</strong> Many progressive women advocate for intersectional approaches that combine gender, race, and class analysis. This approach often aligns with Marxist perspectives on class struggle, leading to a fusion of feminist and Marxist ideas. In this context, women in progressive circles may emphasize the need for systemic change, including critiques of capitalism, which aligns with Marxist and Communist ideologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Media Presence:</strong> Progressive women, particularly younger activists, are often influential on social media platforms. These platforms amplify voices advocating for radical change and may give the impression that women are leading the charge for Marxist or Communist ideals.</p>\n<p><strong>BACK TO SATURDAY’S WARROOM:</strong></p>\n<p>In his defense, White clarified that his comments were directed <strong>not</strong> at women in general but at those who, in his view, are vocal proponents of ideologies that threaten the American system, such as Marxism and Communism.</p>\n<p>White began the segment by expressing his gratitude for the support he has received from his followers, particularly those in Minnesota who helped him secure a victory in the United States primary election. He acknowledged the importance of grassroots efforts and credited Steve Bannon and the War Room team for their unwavering support. “Victory begins victory,” he said, emphasizing that his recent success was a collective effort, driven by the commitment of his supporters.</p>\n<p>White’s remarks reflect a broader concern among some conservatives that radical leftist ideologies are gaining traction in the United States, particularly among certain activist groups. He argued that these ideologies are harmful to the country and pose a direct threat to the rights and freedoms of American citizens.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We have to get past all of the petty distractions and focus on the reality of what’s happening in our country,” White said. “This isn’t about men versus women; it’s about preserving the American system against those who want to tear it down,” White told the WarRoom audience.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>White also attacked the Republican establishment, criticizing it for being out of touch with the needs and concerns of working-class Americans. He pointed to the demographic shifts in places like Minnesota, where the traditional Republican base is increasingly being replaced by a diverse coalition of disillusioned voters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“When you see black Americans, Hispanic working-class Americans, and MAGA patriots crying out for change, you can’t ignore that,” White said. He argued that the Republican Party needs to realign itself with these voters and move away from the “neoconservative, lukewarm” politics that have dominated the party for years.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>White’s rhetoric is a reflection of his populist stance, which prioritizes the interests of ordinary Americans over those of the political elite. He urged his supporters to stay focused on the issues that matter most, such as election integrity and the fight against globalist agendas.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Our only answer is to lean into the truth, embrace it, and be willing to take the consequences,” White declared. He warned that if the American people do not rally against these forces, the country could be lost to the very ideologies he fears.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As White concluded his remarks for the opening segment, he talked about the moment’s urgency, describing it as a pivotal time in American history.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We have 80 days until November, and we need to make some hard decisions about our direction,” he said. He called on his supporters to remain vigilant and to continue fighting for the principles they believe in, even in the face of criticism and opposition.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, Royce White’s comments served as both a defense of his controversial statements and a rallying cry for his supporters. His unapologetic stance on issues like Marxism, Communism, and the future of the Republican Party highlights the deep ideological divide in American politics today.</p>\n<p>As White emerges as a champion of populist ideals, his words resonate with those who feel left behind by the political establishment and are searching for a new direction for the country.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t about me,” White said. “It’s about the ideas that will save America.”</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: <a href=\"https://roycewhite.us/\">Royce White for US Senate</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more on White’s candidacy and his comments about women, watch the full segment from Saturday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>“This Is About A Return To Genuine Republicanism”: Royce White On MAGA’s Struggle For Our Future</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>As the 2024 election nears, Peter Navarro, a former political advisor who served as a critical figure in the Donald J. Trump administration, is sharply criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he labels one of the most radical figures in American politics.</p>\n<p>Navarro frames Harris’s candidacy as a dire threat to the country, painting a vivid picture of what he believes a Harris presidency would entail.  His Friday critique on the WarRoom centers on Harris’s attempts to adopt a populist facade to deceive voters while masking her radical leftist policies.</p>\n<p>Navarro describes Harris’s vision for America as “Camelot with a K,” a play on President John F. Kennedy’s idealized \"Camelot,” but with a twist that he believes reflects chaos and leftist extremism. He asserts that Harris’s policies represent a blend of \"inflation,” \"bordered chaos,” and \"woke” ideology.</p>\n<p>This term, “Camelot with a K,” is Navarro’s way of highlighting the contrast between the media’s idealized image and the reality he believes Harris’s policies would create: a landscape of economic and social turmoil.</p>\n<p>Central to Navarro’s argument is his “Kamala takedown protocol,” a strategic approach he advocates for dismantling Harris’s public persona and exposing the contradictions and potential harms of her policies. He points to Harris’s support for banning fracking as a prime example of her radical stance.</p>\n<p>Navarro argues that this position would devastate Pennsylvania’s economy, disrupt global oil markets, and undermine U.S. energy independence. He contends that such a ban would not only hurt American workers but would also strengthen hostile foreign powers like Russia and Saudi Arabia, who would benefit from diminished U.S. energy production.</p>\n<p>Navarro is equally critical of Harris’s competence and background. He dismisses her academic credentials, describing her law degree from a “mediocre law school” as indicative of her overall lack of substantive experience. He argues that her record as a prosecutor and her performance in the White House reveal a troubling level of incompetence. Navarro’s critique extends to what he perceives as Harris’s disinterest in serious policy issues, suggesting that she is more focused on political maneuvering and undermining President Joe Biden than addressing pressing national challenges.</p>\n<p>Navarro told the WarRoom audience that the fight against Harris is not merely a political contest but a defense of American values and interests. He positions the battle as a crucial stand against policies he believes would harm the nation’s economic stability and security. By contrasting Harris’s radical proposals with the successful policies of former President Donald Trump, Navarro aims to highlight the benefits of Trump’s approach, particularly in terms of energy independence and economic stability.</p>\n<p>Overall, Navarro’s Friday comments reflect a broader strategy to expose what he sees as the dangers of Harris’s radical agenda while leveraging Trump’s past successes as a counterpoint.</p>\n<p>His critique exposes the belief that Harris’s attempt to adopt a populist image is a deceptive tactic designed to obscure her far-left agenda. This makes it crucial for voters to scrutinize her true positions and the potential consequences of her policies.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full opening segment on Friday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Dr. Peter Navarro: The Kamala Takedown Protocol – Attack The Flanks</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Alex DeGrasse, host of the WarRoom, and Matt Boyle had a lengthy and robust conversation on Thursday’s WarRoom program; they focused on the critical role of grassroots activism and the importance of informed voting in the upcoming elections. Boyle, a seasoned political analyst during his time at Breitbart News as their political Editor, brought his deep knowledge of the political landscape to the discussion, emphasizing the significance of white working-class voters and the ongoing efforts by the Republican Party to mobilize them, particularly in the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>Boyle opened by challenging the mainstream media narrative that the election is a sure win for Kamala Harris and the Democrats.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The established media would like everybody to believe that this election is in the bag for the Democrats, and that it’s over for Trump,” he stated. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>However, Boyle emphasized that data from various polls and voter registration numbers paint a different picture, one much more favorable to Republicans. For instance, a recent AARP poll showed Donald Trump leading in Michigan, a crucial battleground state.</p>\n<p>Boyle highlighted the importance of white working-class voters, asserting that “the entire election will be decided by white working-class voters.” These voters, historically a stronghold for Trump, are seen as the key to securing victory in 2024. Voter registration data in Rust Belt states shows a significant shift away from Democrats and toward Republicans since the 2020 election, with Pennsylvania seeing a net swing of over 300,000 votes.</p>\n<p>Boyle also pointed out the efforts by grassroots organizations like Scott Pressler’s and Turning Point Action to register new voters and flip registrations in working-class areas. These efforts target low-propensity voters who might not otherwise turn out on election day. “If our people get out to vote, we will swamp them out,” Boyle emphasized, stressing the importance of voter turnout in securing a Republican victory.</p>\n<p>DeGrasse echoed Boyle’s sentiments, urging grassroots activists to focus on voter registration and participate in the election process. He encouraged people in battleground states to become “Trump Force Captains,” a role that involves mobilizing and turning out voters. DeGrasse also emphasized the importance of becoming poll watchers on election day to ensure the integrity of the vote.</p>\n<p>Boyle also addressed the issue of suppression polls, describing them as efforts by the media to demoralize Republican voters. “There’s a lot of misinformation and disinformation by the established media,” Boyle said. He advised voters to look beyond the headlines and dig deeper into the data to get a clearer picture of where the race truly stands.</p>\n<p>A key difference between the 2016 and 2024 elections, Boyle noted, is the preparedness of the Republican side. In 2016, many in Washington, D.C., did not expect Donald Trump to win, leading to a lack of a coordinated agenda. This time, things are different. “We have a great plan,” Boyle said, referring to President Trump’s agenda for his potential second term. \"The 20-point plan…we’re working to put that into a legislative reality very quickly.”</p>\n<p>The plan is well-organized, with Trump’s team and allies in the House and Senate meticulously planning for the first days, weeks, and months of the new administration. \"It’s going to take all of us to get out to vote, get your friends, get involved, get active on social media,” Boyle urged. The message was clear: everyone has a role to play in securing victory.</p>\n<p>DeGrasse didn’t shy away from acknowledging the uphill battle that lies ahead. \"This is not going to be easy for us,” he admitted, but emphasized the need to stay on the offensive. \"If we can execute, execute, execute…offense, offense, offense,” he reiterated, the path to victory is achievable.</p>\n<p>He also highlighted the importance of House and Senate races, noting that expanding the Republican majority in the House by even five to ten seats would give Trump the breathing room needed to get his agenda through Congress.</p>\n<p>The conversation between DeGrasse and Boyle is a powerful reminder of the importance of grassroots activism and informed voting in the upcoming elections. Boyle’s message was clear: the election will be won or lost based on the efforts of everyday Americans, particularly those in the Rust Belt, to get out and vote.</p>\n<p>Every effort counts in the fight for a brighter future.</p>\n<p>Watch these segments from Thursday’s WarRoom program for more context:</p>\n<h1>Boyle: Republicans In Better Position For 2024 Election Than Media Would Have You Believe</h1>\n<h1>DeGrasse: Posse Needs To Be On Offense, Offense, Offense Through Election Day</h1>\n<h1>MSM Knows President Trump’s Popularity Has Risen Significantly Since 2016 And 2020</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Royce White, Republican candidate for US Senate, and Dave Brat spoke on Thursday on the WarRoom at length about critical issues of unity, race, and the America First platform. Both highlighted the importance of transcending political and racial divides to save the nation and how the America First movement offers a unique opportunity to redefine American politics by prioritizing unity and challenging the status quo.</p>\n<p>Both White and Brat emphasized that unity is essential to overcoming these challenges.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>White stated, “We have to heal the racial divide in order to save the Republic.” He believes that Americans must reject the labels that divide them, such as “European-American” or “African-American,” and instead embrace their shared identity as Americans. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Brat supported this view, arguing that the America First platform offers a path forward that transcends the old Republican-Democrat split, focusing instead on prioritizing the interests of all Americans, regardless of race.</p>\n<p>White urged Christians and patriots to take action, saying, “Love is truth, and we have the opportunity right now to save this country.”</p>\n<p>Royce White, a former NBA player turned political activist, described the current political landscape as a “pivotal moment” for the country. He argued that the stakes in this election are higher than ever before, noting that “we have a chance to decide whether or not we have a country.” White’s message centered on the idea that America is at a crossroads where the election outcome could determine the nation’s future.</p>\n<p>Central to White’s vision is the need to heal the racial divide that has long plagued America. He emphasized that the current political climate, particularly the Democrats’ focus on the LGBTQ+ agenda, has exposed the party’s true intentions. “If they had just kept it about race, they might have been able to keep the wool over black people’s eyes,” White said. However, he believes that the overreach of this agenda has caused many in the black community to see through the Democrats’ facade.</p>\n<p>White further argued that Donald Trump represents a unique figure in American politics, particularly for black voters. He pointed out that Trump was once beloved by the black community, and he celebrated and was invited to their gatherings.</p>\n<p>He believes that Trump’s willingness to challenge both the Democratic and Republican establishments has opened the door for all Americans to see him as a genuine candidate willing to fight the power, rather than simply toeing the party line.</p>\n<p>Brat, a former congressman and economic expert, echoed White’s sentiments, focusing on the failures of Democrat-controlled cities and education systems. He pointed to the dire state of education in major cities like Chicago, where only 12% of poor children in third grade can read at grade level. Brat argued that the Democrats’ control over education has resulted in a system that fails to serve the most vulnerable communities. “They own the turf, and we don’t,” Brat stated, emphasizing the need for conservatives and populists to reclaim education as a key battleground.</p>\n<p>Both White and Brat believe that by uniting around the America First platform, Americans can overcome the divisions that threaten to tear the nation apart and chart a new course for the future.</p>\n<h1>MN Senate Candidate Royce White Joins WarRoom After Winning Nomination From Republicans</h1>\n</div>\n"

Her message was clear: everyone has a role in ensuring that conservative values are upheld in the coming election cycle.</p>\n<p>Martin highlighted several organizations and initiatives to mobilize voters and ensure election integrity.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>She also stressed the significance of a “National Day of Action” set for August 22, coinciding with Kamala Harris’s speech at the DNC Convention.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>“I want everyone to go sign up for that,” Martin urged viewers, pointing them to<a href=\"https://www.teapartypatriots.org/citizensfund/mtv/\"> MarchToVictory.com</a>, a central hub for conservative activism.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>One key activity Martin encouraged people to participate in is a postcard campaign aimed at key voters. \"Even if you don’t live in a swing state, you can send out postcards to ensure crucial voters turn out,” she explained.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Scott Bessent, a respected figure in capital markets, and Dave Brat, former Congressman and economist,  probed the pressing economic issues facing the United States. Bessent painted a vivid picture of two contrasting paths for the nation’s future, calling this election a pivotal moment.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I’ve never seen an election where the choices are this stark,” Bessent remarked, emphasizing the profound impact that voters’ decisions will have on America’s economic trajectory.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bessent highlighted the divergence between two economic models, referring to them as the \"Californication” and \"Minnesota-ification” of America.  California, with its high taxes and heavy regulation, represents one extreme, while Minnesota, also burdened with substantial taxation, symbolizes another. However, Bessent pointed to an even more concerning trend—what he dubbed the “Argentina of America,” referencing the policies of Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>\n<p>Harris is set to deliver a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she will advocate for price controls on grocery stores as a solution to inflation. Bessent quickly criticized this approach, stating, \"That is how you empty the shelves.” Drawing parallels to Argentina’s economic struggles, he argued that price controls would exacerbate supply shortages rather than alleviate them. According to Bessent, the root of inflation lies not in external factors but in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies: \"There’s only one cause of inflation, and that’s the Federal Reserve printing too much money.”</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the current administration’s broader economic policies. Bessent described the Biden-Harris era as characterized by “big spending, big government, big regulation, and big inflation.” He warned that if such policies continue, they will inevitably lead to “big taxes” as the government struggles to fund its spending spree. “They have been running a 7% deficit to GDP… The chickens are going to come home to roost,” he cautioned.</p>\n<p>Dave Brat praised Bessent for stepping out of the shadows of private life and using his expertise to inform the public. Bessent’s willingness to share his knowledge is seen as a brave move, especially when many in the financial world prefer to remain silent.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"We applaud you for that,” Brat said, urging others in the business community to follow Bessent’s lead.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Brat highlighted the importance of truth-telling and leadership, particularly in helping the American people understand complex economic concepts often obscured by political rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Bessent’s analysis wasn’t merely about diagnosing problems; it was also about advocating for solutions. He pointed to the Trump administration’s economic policies as a model for success, emphasizing the combination of tax cuts, deregulation, and private sector growth that kept inflation under control. Bessent’s message was clear: America needs to return to policies that encourage economic growth and fiscal responsibility to avoid the pitfalls of a European-style social democracy.</p>\n<p>As Bessent told Brat, Voters are faced with stark choices that will shape the country’s future, and understanding the economic implications of these choices is essential.</p>\n<p>In a time of uncertainty, voices like Scott Bessent’s offer clarity and direction, reminding us that the stakes have never been higher.</p>\n<p>To hear more from Scott Bessent watch the full discussion with Brat from Thursday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Scott Bessent Warns Of Kamala’s Radical Economic Plan That Will Cause The “Argentinianification” Of The United States</h1>\n</div>\n"

He highlighted discrepancies in polls that seem to favor Harris and called out major polling organizations for being extensions of the mainstream media, which he believes is part of the state apparatus.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The new cycle seemed so starved of material that it allows things like New York Times Sienna to drop a very selected and limited set of three swing States that happened to be Donald Trump’s worst swing States into last Sunday’s news cycle,” Mitchell said, pointing to the selective nature of polling data presented to the public.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Diving into the numbers, Mitchell revealed some stark contrasts between the candidates. For example, when asked if Kamala Harris’s economic policies would be better or worse than Biden’s, only 22% believed they would be better, while 38% thought they would be worse. In contrast, 51% said Trump’s policies would be better than Biden’s, with 38% saying worse.</p>\n<p>This shows a significant advantage for Trump regarding economic issues, which are the number one concern for voters.</p>\n<p>During the segment, Mitchell began by addressing the general reliability of polls, noting that they tend to become more accurate as elections near.</p>\n<p>However, he cautions that recent data shifts seem questionable, especially regarding Kamala Harris’s sudden rise in the polls.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Kamala Harris in the real clear politics aggregate is now up by almost one point,” Mitchell stated, emphasizing that this shift doesn’t align with the underlying fundamentals favoring Trump, where the Democrat candidate is often seen as “incompetent or mentally incompetent.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He explained to Brat that one of his primary concerns is the significant drop in polling activity over the last month. He points out that in the first 13 days of August, there were only 28 state polls, compared to 73 over the previous 13 days of July. This sudden decrease in polling, according to Mitchell, raises suspicions. He suggests that many polling organizations may have stopped after capturing a favorable “Kamala bounce,” which they could use to influence the narrative. “It looks like they went into the field, got a positive Kam Bounce, and then said, ‘Hey, why do we need to poll again?’” Mitchell speculates, adding that this is a sign of the industry “carrying water for the Democrats.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell also addressed Harris’s poor performance on the border issue, noting that she “hit incredibly bad marks on her job as the borders are.”</p>\n<p>On foreign policy, Trump holds a “lower double-digit lead” over Harris regarding the Middle East, a critical issue as tensions rise globally. Mitchell argues that the Democrats’ campaign lacks substance, noting that they haven’t even put out agenda points yet, which will make it difficult for them to sustain their current momentum. “They are not going to be able to carry out this media sugar high all the way to November,” he warns.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s analysis raises serious concerns about the integrity of the polling industry and its influence on public perception. With Trump holding strong leads on critical issues like the economy and foreign policy, Mitchell questions whether Harris’s recent polling surge is legitimate or simply a manufactured narrative designed to boost the Democrats’ chances.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Mark Mitchell:</p>\n<h1>Mark Mitchell: “The [Polling] Industry Is Carrying Water For The Democrats By Ducking And Running”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a timely discussion with Ben Harnwell, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfaB_OFQn9w\">Linda Szynkowicz</a> on Tuesday’s WarRoom, founder and CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.fightvoterfraud.org/about-us/\">Fight Voter Fraud</a> initiative, highlighted the ongoing and alarming issues with voter rolls across the United States. Szynkowicz’s revelations paint a troubling picture of systemic weaknesses in election integrity, exposing the urgent need for reforms ahead of the 2024 elections.</p>\n<p>Szynkowicz’s organization, which operates in 36 states, has been at the forefront of addressing voter roll inaccuracies. During the interview, she detailed significant findings from their research, mainly focusing on Connecticut. \"In Connecticut, despite presenting evidence, we still have 524 deceased voters on the rolls from 2020,” Szynkowicz stated. She emphasized the gravity of the situation, noting that these deceased individuals remained active on voter rolls and, in some cases, even participated in elections.</p>\n<p>The Fight Voter Fraud initiative’s work involves identifying and removing deceased voters and addressing instances of double registrations. Szynkowicz revealed that her team has uncovered thousands of discrepancies, including \"758 deceased voters found on the rolls and 2450 double registrations.” She criticized the lack of action by state officials and election authorities, arguing that their inaction perpetuates the problem. \"It is unbelievable that even after presenting proof, deceased voters are not being removed from the rolls,” she lamented.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"If they stole the election in 2020, they will certainly try to do it again in 2024,” she warned, alluding to concerns about the potential for repeated fraud. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Her remarks reflect a deep-seated frustration with what she perceives as systemic failures in election oversight.</p>\n<p>The conversation took a critical turn as Szynkowicz discussed the broader context of her efforts. She emphasized the importance of grassroots involvement, urging citizens to actively participate in ensuring voter roll accuracy. \"You can check your local voter rolls and challenge any inaccuracies,” she advised. She encouraged the public to visit their website, fightvoterfraud.org, for tools and information to help address these issues locally.</p>\n<p>Szynkowicz’s initiative also recently submitted evidence to the FBI regarding double voting cases in states like North Carolina, West Virginia, and Maryland. \"There are hundreds of thousands of double-registered voters across the country,” she said, underscoring the scale of the problem and the need for rigorous enforcement against voter fraud.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on her experience since founding the initiative in 2018, Szynkowicz noted that the situation has worsened over time. \"The problem has been growing since at least 2008,” she remarked, expressing concern over the increasing prevalence of fraudulent registrations. She stressed the importance of vigilance and accountability, both from election officials and the public.</p>\n<p>Szynkowicz’s conversation with Harnwell reveals a pressing need for reform in voter registration practices. Her insights into the persistence of voter roll inaccuracies and the potential for electoral fraud in 2024 are a stark reminder of the challenges facing election integrity efforts.</p>\n<p>CALL TO ACTION:</p>\n<p>As the fight against voter fraud continues, Szynkowicz’s call to action for increased public engagement and oversight remains critical.</p>\n<p>RESOURCES:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.fightvoterfraud.org/about-us/\">Fight Voter Fraud Website</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Linda Szynkowicz:</p>\n<h1>Szynkowicz: “There’s Hundreds Of Thousands Of People That Are Double Registered Across The Country”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In recent weeks, the political landscape has been marked by an intriguing juxtaposition of poll results and media narratives that are mostly confusing to political watchers. Mark Mitchell, a prominent figure in political polling for Rasmussen polls, raised alarm bells on Saaturday’s WarRoom, over what he describes as a deliberate effort by mainstream media to skew perceptions of Kamala Harris’s candidacy and downplay Donald Trump’s resilience.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s critique centers on the stark contrast between the media’s portrayal of Harris and the actual data from his polling firm.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"If you go to Real Clear Politics, you’ll see a sea of blue polls showing Kamala Harris beating Donald Trump,” Mitchell pointed out. \"Yet our numbers, released last Thursday, show Trump still beating her nationally by five points in both two-way and multi-way matchups.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Mitchell, this discrepancy underscores a troubling trend: despite Harris’s historically low approval ratings and lackluster polling performances, media outlets continue to present her as a formidable contender.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s skepticism extends beyond just the numbers. He argues that the media’s narrative—characterizing Harris as a rising star—serves a dual purpose: it pressures the Trump campaign and attempts to mitigate the negative impact of Harris’s unimpressive track record.</p>\n<p>\"They’re trying to maximize the effect of the few positive polls she has and put pressure on the Trump campaign,” Mitchell observed. \"I think they’re trying to minimize the stink of incompetence that she has.”</p>\n<p>This pattern of media distortion, Mitchell argues, is not unprecedented. On the WarRoom, he drew a parallel with the 2016 election, where mainstream polls heavily favored Hillary Clinton. \"Back in 2016, there were numerous polls showing Clinton with a double-digit lead over Trump on election day,” Mitchell recalled.</p>\n<p>\"Despite this, Trump won the Electoral College, proving that the media’s polling often fails to capture the true sentiment of the electorate.” Mitchell’s point is clear: media manipulation of polling data is a recurring issue designed to influence public perception rather than reflect reality.</p>\n<p>Adding to the complexity, Mitchell noted to WarRoom host Royce White, that despite Harris’s poor track record on critical issues such as border control and overall favorability, the media continues to push a positive narrative. \"Kamala Harris has never pulled better than Joe Biden,” he stated. \"Her record is abysmal, with 49% of voters saying she has done a poor job on the borders, and only 19% believing she’s better than recent vice presidents.” This stark contrast between her actual performance and media portrayal raises questions about the motivations behind such reporting.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s concern about the integrity of polling data is further evidenced by the lack of recent national numbers from major polling firms, he told White.</p>\n<p>\"We’re the only ones putting out fresh national data this week,” he said. \"Others have outdated numbers from early August or earlier. The absence of current data from major pollsters indicates a potential effort to suppress unfavorable findings about Harris.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Mitchell advised scrutiny of future polls to uncover any biases or methodological flaws.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Watch for oversampled Democrats or shifts in how data is weighted,” he suggested. \"The industry is carrying water for Harris, and it’s crucial for voters to understand the real dynamics of this race.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mitchell’s remarks expose what he sees as a concerted effort by the media to distort the reality of Kamala Harris’s candidacy and Donald Trump’s standing.</p>\n<p>To hear more of Mitchell’s report to the WarRoom watch the full Saturday WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Mark Mitchell: “Trump Is Doing As Well Against Kamala Harris As He Was Doing Against Joe Biden”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, provided a detailed update on electoral reforms to the WarRoom on Saturday about Georgia. Martin’s insights addressed the critical need for transparency and accuracy in future elections there.</p>\n<p>Martin began by celebrating recent victories in Georgia’s election reforms from the past week.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The Georgia State Election Board has passed some significant rules,” she noted, emphasizing the new requirement for voters to show ID when returning absentee ballots in person. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Martin also praised the clarification on certification procedures, which she believes is essential to ensure that votes are accurately counted before certification, thus avoiding post-certification disputes that plagued previous elections.</p>\n<p>A major focus of Martin’s commentary was reopening an investigation into alleged voting irregularities in Fulton County from the 2020 election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The investigation into duplicate and missing ballots has been revived,” she said. Martin expressed frustration that the investigation had not been fully covered or resolved previously, stressing the importance of learning from past mistakes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong> “We have to ensure that we understand what went wrong to prevent a repeat of those issues in future elections,” she added.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>One of Martin’s key points was her support for a new rule that mandates counting ballots at the precinct level before they leave. This rule, set to be finalized by August 19th, would ensure that the number of paper ballots matches the number of ballots scanned and reconciles with the number of voters who checked in that day. “This is a simple yet crucial step to ensure the accuracy of our vote counts,” Martin said.</p>\n<p>She believes that this measure will help address discrepancies and build confidence in the electoral process.</p>\n<p>Martin acknowledged calls for paper ballots’ importance and pointed out the practical constraints. “While paper ballots are crucial, implementing such a change on a large scale right before an election may be challenging,” she noted.</p>\n<p>Martin argued that significant changes to the voting process would require action from the state legislature rather than administrative orders alone. She praised Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s executive order for paper ballots but recognized that similar measures in Georgia would need legislative support to be effective.</p>\n<p>She concluded her WarRoom discussion with a call to action for vigilance and preparation.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> “We need to ensure our processes are as secure as possible given where we are with the upcoming election,” she emphasized. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Her remarks reflect a broader concern about electoral integrity and the need for continuous improvement in the voting system.</p>\n<p>Martin’s comments shed light on the ongoing efforts to reform Georgia’s election process, focusing on transparency, accuracy, and the need for legislative action to support meaningful changes.</p>\n<p>Her advocacy for practical measures and thorough investigations underscores a commitment to ensuring that future elections are conducted with the utmost integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: </strong></p>\n<p>Please Visit Tea Party Patriots Website for more information: <a href=\"https://www.teapartypatriots.org/archive/jennybethmartin/\">Tea Party Patriots</a></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment from Saturday featuring Jenny Beth Martin and show host, Royce White:</p>\n<h1>Jenny Beth Martin On Necessity For GA Election Integrity Before November</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a fiery monologue during his guest-hosting appearance on Steve Bannon’s War Room, Royce White delivered a powerful critique of the current political climate, with a specific focus on the concept of citizenship and the Democratic Party’s manipulation of the Black community. White, speaking from Minneapolis, did not hold back in his assessment of how the idea of democracy has been twisted and used as a tool for control rather than a genuine expression of the people’s will.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We are coming. The people are coming,” White declared, emphasizing the need for individuals to embrace their citizenship, uphold the truth, and reclaim their autonomy.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>White began by challenging the Democrats’ constant use of the word “democracy,” arguing that it has become a form of “gaslighting” rather than a true reflection of America’s governance. “We live in a constitutional Republic,” White asserted, clearly distinguishing between the ideals of democracy and the reality of the political system. He criticized what he described as the “heresy of democracy,” a concept that assumes “all majorities are made right and equal.” In White’s view, not all majorities are righteous or just, and the blind acceptance of majority rule can lead to tyranny.</p>\n<p>Transitioning into a discussion about the Black community, White offered a historical perspective on how African Americans have been systematically manipulated, drawing on the infamous figure Willie Lynch, known for his brutal methods of controlling slaves. White described how Lynch’s tactics were designed not just to physically subdue Black people, but to psychologically break them. “If you can break the image of the Black man in the mind of the Black woman, she will raise her offspring in reverse roles,” White explained, highlighting the long-lasting impact of this psychological manipulation.</p>\n<p>This, White argued, is emblematic of how the Democratic Party has continued to exploit the Black community, building a political coalition “mainly on the backs of a Black narrative that undoubtedly is intended to take their freedom from you.” He contended that the Democrats’ promises, particularly those offering protection from white supremacy through the expansion of federal government power, are nothing more than “a scam, a Ponzi scheme.” White lamented that the Black community has been kept in a state of dependency and fear, largely due to the promises of safety and security from a government that ultimately does not deliver.</p>\n<p>White’s critique extended to the failure of the Democratic Party to fulfill its promises, leading to growing disillusionment within the Black community. “When lies build up to that level of contradiction, people start to fall off the bandwagon,” White said. He pointed to the example of Joe Biden’s infamous remark, “If you don’t vote for me, you ain’t Black,” as a blatant insult to the intelligence and autonomy of Black voters.</p>\n<p>White praised Donald Trump as a transformative figure who has begun to break the psychological hold the Democrats have had over Black Americans. He noted that Trump’s straightforward approach has resonated with many Black men, leading to a significant shift in political allegiance. “Black men all across this country now poll for him at 51%,” White stated, marking it as the highest support for a Republican presidential candidate among Black men in recent memory.</p>\n<p>In his closing remarks for the opening segment, White issued a call to action, urging Black Americans to rise up and reject the Democratic Party’s control.</p>\n<p>He called on people to rely on the Bible and the Constitution as guiding documents, asserting that these hold real value in Americans’ lives. White’s message was clear: it is time for the Black community to break free from the chains of political manipulation and take an active role in shaping the future of the nation.</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p><strong>Royce White is a Candidate for US Senate in Minnesota – visit his site: <a href=\"https://roycewhite.us/\">Royce White for Senate</a></strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full opening segment of Saturday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Royce White On Kamala Pulling The Race Card, Democrats’ Growing Lies, And The Attack On Christians</h1>\n</div>\n"

Trump urged Georgia officials to act after the State Election Board referred a historic 2020 election fraud case for further investigation.</p>\n<p>The case, SEB2023-025, which includes evidence of <a href=\"https://warroom.org/report-3930-duplicates-in-fulton-county-in-2020-were-intentional-fraud/\"><span>intentional election fraud</span></a>, has survived after more than two years of stonewalling and <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>cover up attempts</span></a> by Fulton County and the Secretary of State’s office.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, led by Dr. Janice Johnston, Janelle King, and Rick Jeffares, the State Election Board voted to override Chairman John Fervier and send the complaint’s <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1821173797518533036?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>major findings</span></a>of 17,852 missing ballot images in the machine recount, 3,930 duplicates, and 10 non-existent tabulators providing over 20,000 votes to the original count to Attorney General Chris Carr’s office for further investigation.</p>\n<p>President Trump responded to the decision on Truth social.</p>\n<p>\"The Attorney General of Georgia MUST get moving on this. So must Governor Kemp, and the Secretary of State,” he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112922807055677257\"><span>said</span></a>. \"It’s Fulton County again. Why aren’t they doing this? What is going on? We can’t let this happen again. WE MUST WIN GEORGIA IN 2024!!! The Governor and A.G. MUST LEAD!”</p>\n<p>The 3-2 vote requires Carr’s office to use outside investigators and report back within 30 days. If they are \"unwilling or unable” to conduct an investigation, the State Election Board will seek outside legal counsel to take it over.</p>\n<p>The Board also voted for the AG to complete a conflict of interest assessment to determine who should represent the State Election Board in this matter. Brad Rafffensperger’s general counsel Charlene McGowan previously stated it was the position of the Attorney General’s office that the State Election Board \"cannot pursue complaints against” the Secretary of State, which bears the ultimate responsibility as the chief elections official in Georgia for the allegations of fraud raised in the complaint.</p>\n<p>McGowan took over the investigation into the complaint after it was abruptly pulled from the State Election Board meeting’s agenda last December.  She previously worked in Carr’s office as the assistant district attorney, and also worked to impede investigations into the Secretary of State. When former Chairman of the State Election Board William Duffey sought further investigation into SEB2021-181, a previous case brought by the complainants of SEB2023-025, involving more than 4,081 false votes for Joe Biden that were inserted into the hand count audit — McGowan shut it down. She claimed the AG’s office \"does not take legal action against their own clients,” which includes the Secretary of State, in an email sent July 21, 2023.</p>\n<p>\"I have instructed our investigations division that this office will not be opening up a case on this complaint,” McGowan wrote.</p>\n<p>Now, a year later, McGowan is keeping evidence for SEB2023-025 (or lack thereof) hidden from the Election Board, <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1816456290329080273?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>holding it hostage in exchange for closing the case</span></a>. The state wanted the Board to agree to close the investigation before letting the Board see the evidence which is the entire basis for closing the investigation.</p>\n<p>In trying to block the case from moving forward, Fervier repeatedly contended the matter was already \"closed,” because of a May 7 hearing where the Secretary of State and Fulton County failed to disprove the allegations and spread <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1816911908731322368?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>misinformation</span></a> about 2020 and Georgia’s elections, including basic information of how votes are tabulated.</p>\n<p>McGowan’s predecessor, Ryan Germany, also appeared at the Wednesday Board meeting and continued to lie about 2020, <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1821208067289100423?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>falsely claiming</span></a> no ballots were scanned twice. There were 3,930 ballots scanned multiple times in Fulton County alone, which were <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1821177531510485045?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>deliberately</span></a> taken from different batches and scanned to make new ones days later, and flipped over in order to reverse their order.</p>\n<p>Germany inserted himself into the Board meeting to provide a so-called \"monitoring team” for Fulton County in 2024, to observe voting problems Germany claims do not even exist. The monitoring team was, in the words of Dr. Johnston, \"<a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1821220334206435597?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>cooked up</span></a>” by former Board member Ed Lindsey to crush the case before it was even heard on May 7.</p>\n<p>Kevin Moncla, who along with Joe Rossi brought the complaint more than two years ago, sent a letter to the Election Board Wednesday morning ahead of the vote arguing the case has never been truly adjudicated because the complainants were not given the opportunity to present their findings in a hearing.</p>\n<p>\"The initial investigation was a sham,” Moncla wrote. \"Fulton County refused to make its technical expert available to the Board for the hearing. Fulton County did not find the requested documentation.”</p>\n<p>Further, Moncla noted, Fulton County itself says the case is open and \"under investigation” — so it can continue to hide the ballot images it claimed to have found in the state’s \"<a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1816458166709752182?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>Exhibit 11</span></a>,” which it still refuses to share with the Election Board.</p>\n<p>\"Fulton County wants to have its cake and eat it too,” Moncla said. \"It claims there is an investigation for refusing to provide documents that it is required by law to provide, whether or not an investigation is pending. But it also claims the matter is a final ‘adjudication’ and there is no investigation pending. These positions are contradictory and at odds with Georgia and federal law.”</p>\n<p>Montclair demanded a hearing and an independent investigation by qualified experts who understand the voting system.</p>\n<p>\"The right to know that a vote is cast in a manner that will be secure and not diluted by improper conduct is a fundamental governmental interest,” he said.</p>\n<p>In addition to keeping the election fraud complaint alive, the State Election Board advanced several election integrity rules ahead of the November presidential election.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Thursday’s WarRoom discussion hosted by Lara Logan, Dr. Keith Rose, a seasoned expert in U.S. intelligence, unveiled disturbing revelations about the geopolitical shifts in Afghanistan following the disastrous U.S. withdrawal under Democrat Joe Biden’s administration.</p>\n<p>The conversation emphasized the messy and deadly consequences on national and global security, painting a stark picture of the alliances forming in the power vacuum left by American forces.</p>\n<p><strong>A Troubling Meeting of Minds</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Rose began by recounting a critical meeting that took place a year before the U.S. pullout. This meeting involved Chinese military, diplomatic, and intelligence officials alongside representatives from the Afghan Ministry of Defense. This meeting signified a burgeoning relationship between China and Afghanistan, setting the stage for future cooperation. However, the true extent of this alliance became apparent in a subsequent gathering shortly before the U.S. exit.</p>\n<p>This meeting, Rose said, held under heightened secrecy, brought together key figures, including CIA Director William Burns, Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, Chinese intelligence officials, members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Pakistani representatives. Haqqani, a figure with a notorious history of violence against Americans and a substantial bounty on his head, was a central participant, raising questions about the nature of these discussions.</p>\n<p>“Why was Sirajuddin Haqqani, a man with a $10 million bounty, present at such a meeting?” Dr. Rose questioned. “And why was there a tier-one security team in place instead of CIA personnel?” These questions highlight the opaque nature of these meetings and suggest a strategic recalibration that could have far-reaching consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>The New Axis of Power</strong></p>\n<p>Rose’s insights into Afghanistan’s strategic landscape painted a picture of growing Chinese influence, particularly in the military, security, and intelligence sectors. “The Taliban and China are forming a dangerous alliance,” Rose stated, highlighting the implications for U.S. security. This collaboration extends beyond mere political alignment, encompassing economic and military dimensions that could reshape the region’s geopolitical dynamics.</p>\n<p>A key concern raised by Dr. Rose is the Taliban’s ability to issue biometric passports, potentially facilitating the movement of trained operatives. “Afghanistan’s passport office can create documentation that allows trained individuals to travel globally,” he explained. This capability poses a significant threat, as it could enable the infiltration of jihadis into the U.S. and other Western nations.</p>\n<p><strong>The Growing Threat of Jihadism</strong></p>\n<p>Rose warned of the Taliban training thousands of jihadis, with the potential for these individuals to exploit established networks and reach U.S. soil. This threat is compounded by the strategic expansion of China in Afghanistan, which could further destabilize the region and challenge U.S. influence.</p>\n<p>“The Chinese presence in Afghanistan is not just an economic endeavor; it’s a strategic move to undermine U.S. interests,” Rose argued. According to Rose, this partnership has positioned China as a dominant player in Afghanistan, influencing key sectors and threatening regional stability.</p>\n<p><strong>A Call for Vigilance</strong></p>\n<p>The revelations shared by Dr. Rose underscore the urgent need for a reassessment of U.S. foreign policy and security strategies. The alliance between the Taliban and China presents a multifaceted threat, with implications extending beyond Afghanistan’s borders. As the U.S. grapples with these developments, it must remain vigilant and proactive in addressing the evolving geopolitical landscape.</p>\n<p>The strategic realignment in Afghanistan serves as a sobering reminder of the complexities of global politics. The U.S. must navigate these challenges with foresight and determination, safeguarding its interests and those of its allies against emerging threats.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Dr. Rose and Lara Logan:</p>\n<h1>CIA Meeting With Terrorist Before Afghan Pullout Led To Afghanistan Being Under Chinese Influence</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent discussion, policy expert George Pond shed light on a concerning geopolitical scenario through the lens of fiction and current events. Pond, who is deeply involved in policy work and a friend of Dr. Richard Funk, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cartel-Wars-Consequences-Americas-Border/dp/B0D9549MH5\">Cartel Wars</a>, explained how this fictional novel mirrors the real and imminent threats posed by the alliance between Chinese interests and Mexican cartels.</p>\n<p>Cartel Wars is not just a work of fiction but a reflection of growing anxieties about national security. The novel, penned by Dr. Funk, envisions a scenario where Chinese-backed Mexican cartels orchestrate an invasion of the United States, specifically targeting Texas. This invasion, depicted in the book, sees Austin fall and highlights the resilience of Americans who ultimately push back against the threat. Pond shared insights about the book’s relevance, noting, \"The book captures the essence of what could happen if we remain complacent about the growing threat from these alliances.”</p>\n<p>Pond’s discussion on the WarRoom with Lara Logan on Thursday tied the fictional narrative to real-world concerns, particularly the implications of open border policies and the strategic manipulations of adversarial nations. He drew parallels between the novel’s portrayal of a Mexican cartel invasion and recent global developments. \"When I saw the events unfold in Israel, it was a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are,” Pond remarked, referring to the surprise attacks on Israel and comparing them to potential threats facing the U.S.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the bigger issues of such alliances for American security. Pond described how the Mexican cartels, in collaboration with China, could exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. border security and infrastructure. He emphasized that this collaboration is a theoretical threat and an evolving reality. \"We have been under an invasion for a long time,” Pond asserted, highlighting the ongoing issues of drug warfare, human trafficking, and smuggling that are already affecting American communities.</p>\n<p>Pond further elaborated on the strategic aspects of these threats, noting how China has used its partnership with Mexican cartels to establish a de facto \"Silk Road” into the United States.</p>\n<p>\"The Chinese have weaponized Mexican cartels and used them as proxies in their unrestricted warfare against the U.S.,” Pond explained, illustrating how this alliance could undermine American security from within.</p>\n<p>The discussion also delved into how this situation intersects with current geopolitical tensions, particularly the risk of broader conflicts involving China. Pond warned of the potential for increased aggression, noting, \"We could be on the brink of a major war if tensions with China escalate, especially given the current geopolitical climate.”</p>\n<p>Pond’s insights into Cartel Wars and its real-world implications serve as a call to action for policymakers and citizens alike. \"Understanding and addressing these risks are crucial for safeguarding national security and preparing for potential future conflicts,” Pond concluded, reinforcing the need for vigilance in the face of these evolving challenges.</p>\n<p>Watch the full interview with Lara Logan:</p>\n<h1>Pond: Fictional Novel By Dr. Richard Funk Warns Of The Threat Of The Mexican Cartel/CCP Alliance</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Mark Paoletta raised a chilling alarm about the potential consequences of a Kamala Harris administration on Thursday’s WarRoom, focusing mainly on fears of radical judicial and political control reminiscent of Venezuela’s authoritarian practices.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The radicalism of Kamala Harris’s early appointments, including Tim Walz, represents a troubling shift toward extreme leftist policies,” Paoletta asserts.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Paoletta, the radical shift in U.S. politics could mirror the Venezuelan model of judicial manipulation, a scenario that should be taken very seriously by American voters.</p>\n<p>Walz, who is known for his ties to <a href=\"https://warroom.org/tim-walzs-authoritarian-shift-his-ties-to-communist-china-and-radical-policies-will-reshape-america/\">Communist China</a>, extreme leftist views, and controversial handling of civil unrest in Minneapolis, is seen by Paoletta as emblematic of Harris’s broader alignment with the radical left. He warns that such appointments are not merely symbolic but signals a deeper, potentially dangerous transformation in U.S. governance.</p>\n<p>He suggests that Walz’s tenure might be a precursor to including even more radical figures in key administrative positions, such as Cory Bush, Jamal Bowman, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib. This could result in significant policy changes and an aggressive push for leftist agendas that might threaten democratic norms.</p>\n<p>A particularly striking aspect of Paoletta’s analysis is his comparison of potential future actions by a Harris administration with the Venezuelan model of judicial control. He warns that if Democrats gain control, they might attempt to manipulate or even dismantle the Supreme Court in ways similar to the actions taken by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez. Paoletta cites the Venezuelan experience as a dire warning: \"Hugo Chávez’s packing of the Supreme Court with loyalists allowed him to rule with minimal checks on his power. This is exactly the kind of threat we face if the left’s radical agenda succeeds here.”</p>\n<p>Paoletta’s concerns revolve around the idea that a potential Harris administration could emulate Venezuela’s approach by undermining judicial independence to ensure compliance with radical policies. This includes replacing Supreme Court justices or altering the Court’s jurisdiction to secure a political rubber stamp on government actions. Such moves could erode constitutional protections and curtail freedoms, marking a significant departure from democratic norms.</p>\n<p>In light of these concerns, Paoletta urges Americans to remain vigilant and proactive. He emphasizes the importance of electoral participation and public engagement in holding politicians accountable. “The best way to counter this threat is through active civic engagement. Voters must ensure they are informed and involved in the democratic process to safeguard against these radical shifts,” Paoletta advises.</p>\n<p>To combat the potential overreach, Paoletta suggests several actions:</p>\n<p>Vigilant Voting: Stay informed about candidates’ policies and their potential impact on judicial independence.</p>\n<p>Public Advocacy: Engage in advocacy efforts to uphold constitutional norms and resist radical changes.</p>\n<p>Support for Constitutional Protections: Support organizations and initiatives that defend judicial independence and civil liberties.</p>\n<p>As Paoletta exposes, learning from historical precedents like Venezuela and remaining engaged in the democratic process, Americans can work to prevent such authoritarian shifts and preserve the principles of democracy and rule of law.</p>\n<p>For more on Paoletta’s ideas, watch the full WarRoom segment on Thursday:</p>\n<h1>Mark Paoletta Forewarns Kamala’s Radical Plans To Weaponize The Courts</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In recent years, the United Kingdom has become a troubling case study in the erosion of civil liberties, particularly concerning free speech and the weaponization of the internet. As the US grapples with its own challenges, it is crucial to understand these warnings from across the Atlantic and consider their implications for American society.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We are seeing a disturbing trend where any form of dissent or criticism is being labeled as domestic terrorism. This redefinition is not just a bureaucratic shift but a strategic move to silence opposition and control the narrative. It’s a dangerous precedent that criminalizes free expression and punishes those who challenge the status quo,” Peter McIlvenna remarked to Dave Brat on Thursday’s WarRoom.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the UK, government measures to control online discourse have intensified after violent riots over immigration strains, reflecting a broader trend of internet censorship. The UK’s recent approach has included the crackdown on so-called \"misinformation” about the riots and the extensive monitoring of social media activities.</p>\n<p>McIlvenna, a European commentator, appeared on the WarRoom on Thursday and further highlighted how individuals there have faced severe penalties for online posts deemed offensive or controversial, with some facing lengthy prison sentences for minor infractions.</p>\n<p>He reported to Brat about cases where UK individuals were jailed for \"waving their arms around” or for making provocative statements online.</p>\n<p>He talked to Brat about the troubling aspect of this crackdown, which is not just the suppression of dissent but also its broader implications for free speech.</p>\n<p>Individuals critical of government policies or discussing sensitive issues in the UK are increasingly vulnerable to legal repercussions.</p>\n<p>This trend exposes a significant risk for all other Western countries, including the United States: as governments label dissenting views as misinformation, they effectively stifle meaningful discourse and frustrate citizens who have legitimate grievances.</p>\n<p><strong>Domestic Terrorism vs. Foreign Invasions</strong></p>\n<p>A critical concern mirrored in both the UK and the US that the two touched on during the WarRoom segment is the focus on the government’s use of domestic terrorism policies. Governments are increasingly labeling certain domestic activities and political expressions as forms of terrorism, thereby justifying stringent measures against their citizens. In the US, this has manifested in a heightened focus on domestic extremism and cyber threats, often at the expense of addressing other pressing issues.</p>\n<p>As domestic security agencies intensify their surveillance and enforcement actions, citizens have limited channels for discussing their frustrations or advocating for change.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, both countries have faced challenges related to immigration and foreign invasions. In the UK, there has been significant unrest related to the influx of migrants and refugees, with some incidents turning violent. Despite the seriousness of these events, the consequences for those involved are often less severe compared to the stringent measures applied to domestic critics.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in the US, the debate over immigration policies and border security has become highly polarized. While there are ongoing concerns about illegal immigration and its impact on national security, the focus on domestic terrorism sometimes overshadows the need for balanced and effective immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Several solutions have been proposed to address these issues and foster a more peaceful and just society. For example both the UK and the US must reassess their approaches to free speech and online censorship. Governments should ensure that measures to combat misinformation do not infringe upon fundamental rights or stifle legitimate discourse. Transparent and fair processes for addressing online content and grievances are essential to maintaining public trust.</p>\n<p>The warning signs from the UK about internet censorship and domestic terrorism should serve as a critical alert for the US.</p>\n<p>By addressing these issues with a balanced and thoughtful approach, both countries can work towards preserving civil liberties while effectively managing security concerns and addressing the needs of their citizens.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full interview from Thursday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>How The UK Redefined Terrorism And Misinformation To Target Free Speech And Right-Wing Persons</h1>\n</div>\n"

He points out that the story is not just about recent years or the Trump administration but highlights the long-standing issues within the government. According to Taylor, the film “applies not just during the Trump years. But it goes back, then it goes forward because you know, these people will still be around if we don’t hold them accountable.”</p>\n<p>One of the most alarming aspects of the film, according to Taylor, is the extent of the intelligence community’s involvement in unethical activities. He reveals that “the intelligence apparatus…did the work on behalf of the Clinton campaign.” Taylor explains that it is “very uncommon if not at all for the CIA or the NSA to do these kinds of things,” and expresses his concern over their unchecked power.</p>\n<p>The film initially included evidence that “the NSA allowed the wiretapping of the White House,” but due to time constraints, this information was cut. Taylor describes a chilling scenario where “you had a lot of wiretapping of government officials from other government officials from the deep state.” This illustrates how the intelligence community, with its “unlimited power, unlimited reach, and unlimited money,” can target anyone they dislike.</p>\n<p>He warns, “These are very dangerous people. These are very dangerous organizations,” who can “wiretap you, arrest you, and get rid of you” if they see fit. This level of corruption within the government raises significant concerns about privacy, accountability, and the future of democracy.</p>\n<p>Despite these unsettling discoveries, Taylor insists that his film is ultimately a story of hope and resilience. He believes it demonstrates that the perpetrators of such corruption can be defeated. “This is actually a positive film,” Taylor states, adding, “it shows that they got caught” and were stopped by individuals like Kash Patel, who played a crucial role in exposing the truth.</p>\n<p>Taylor’s film serves as a wake-up call to citizens and policymakers alike, urging them to hold those in power accountable and work towards a more transparent and just government. He said he hopes audiences will walk away with a renewed sense of empowerment, knowing that systemic corruption can be challenged and defeated.</p>\n<p>The WarRoom film, is available at warroom.film, and provides an insightful look into government corruption, encouraging viewers to stay vigilant and informed.</p>\n<h1>Taylor Government Gangsters Will Still Be Around If We Don’t Hold Them Accountable</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent discussion between E.J. Antoni and Dave Brat, the conversation focused on the pressing need to reduce the size of government to stabilize the economy and protect the interests of the American people. Both experts emphasized that unchecked government spending and intervention are at the heart of many fiscal problems faced by the U.S. today. Their discussion provides a comprehensive analysis of why a smaller government is not just a policy preference but a necessity for economic prosperity.</p>\n<p>E.J. Antoni began by highlighting how excessive government spending and borrowing have created an environment where low interest rates and inflation have become the norm.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“You have to reduce the size of government,” Antoni stated, pointing out that “government expenditures” drive the printing of trillions of dollars, leading to “artificially low interest rates.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He warns that the current fiscal policies resemble those of Japan, where decades of near-zero interest rates have resulted in severe economic challenges. “Japan really is a warning sign to the United States,” Antoni remarked, emphasizing the dangers of continuing on the same fiscal path without reform.</p>\n<p>Brat echoed Antoni’s sentiments, stressing that the current economic system seems rigged against the average American. He criticized the high level of leverage in stock market activities, likening them to casino bets, and noted that this system benefits only the wealthy few. “America First means we need to organize this economy for the American worker, not for the rich 10 percent,” Brat asserted. By prioritizing the interests of a small elite, current policies neglect the broader population’s needs and contribute to widening economic inequality.</p>\n<p>Both experts agreed that reducing the size of the government would directly benefit the average citizen by curbing inflation and lowering living costs.</p>\n<p>Antoni passionately argued that the “fiscal problems” of today are directly tied to “monetary problems,” and a leaner government would prevent the cycle of debt that leads to economic instability. He urged citizens to hold elected officials accountable for supporting expansive budgets and challenged them to demand more responsible fiscal policies.</p>\n<p>Brat further emphasized the populist nature of this reform, stating, “This is not partisan. This is populist.” He argued that a more efficient government would be less likely to cater to special interests and more likely to create policies benefiting the entire nation.</p>\n<p>Antoni and Brat served as a clarion call for a shift in how government operates in the U.S. By reducing its size and focusing on efficient, responsible fiscal management, the government can pave the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.</p>\n<p>For more on their discussion, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>“We Can Expect A Lot More Inflation”: Antoni Gives Post-Kamala Krash Analysis Of Financial Markets</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna appeared on the WarRoom on Wednesday and voiced grave concerns about voter intimidation and suppression tactics observed during the Georgia runoff elections. Her remarks underscore the critical need for vigilance and action to ensure fair and accessible elections for all Americans.</p>\n<p>Luna’s experience on the ground in Georgia revealed disturbing efforts to undermine voter turnout, which she described as part of a broader strategy around the nation to suppress Republican votes. Luna highlighted her firsthand observations of left-wing funded efforts to deter voters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>She noted, “We were actually touring the state getting up to vote for some of our Senate candidates. There was actually a group of people putting up billboards funded by the left-wing, intentionally trying to suppress voter turnout.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>These billboards, according to Luna, conveyed messages aimed at discouraging potential voters by suggesting that their votes wouldn’t count, thereby undermining electoral participation.</p>\n<p>This kind of intimidation, she argues, is part of a larger pattern of bias and manipulation. Luna is alarmed by what she perceives as a double standard in how voter suppression is handled. She expressed frustration over how conservative voices are often censored while similar or more severe actions by the left go unchecked.</p>\n<p>“If you color outside the lines, we get deplatformed and censored. Leaders of Congress can call for outright insurrections, yet if it’s done on the right, we’re treated as domestic terrorists,” Luna criticized.</p>\n<p>To counteract these tactics and protect the integrity of elections, Luna calls for proactive measures. She urges voters to be aware and engaged, emphasizing the importance of participating in elections and ensuring that every vote counts. “If you see something, say something,” she advises, stressing the need for vigilance and reporting any suspicious activities that could undermine the electoral process.</p>\n<p>Luna also highlighted the need for comprehensive monitoring and legal action to address voter suppression.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a compelling discussion, Jack Brewer, former NFL player and founder of the Jack Brewer Foundation, shed light on the systemic failures impacting families in Minnesota and the profound impact of his ministry. Brewer’s reflections critique the inadequacies of government interventions and emphasize the transformative power of faith in addressing deep-seated societal issues.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Brewer’s focus on Minnesota highlights a troubling reality: “In Minneapolis, black families are four times poorer than white families,” he noted, pointing to severe economic disparities. He criticized the government’s inability to effectively tackle these issues, saying, “The system has failed these communities, leaving them to struggle with poverty and lack of opportunity.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Brewer’s ministry seeks to address these gaps by providing support to some of the most vulnerable populations, including those incarcerated and struggling with addiction.</p>\n<p>Brewer’s work with the Jack Brewer Foundation illustrates a hands-on approach to tackling these issues. “We go into the prisons, preach the word of God, and give inmates tools to transition back into society,” Brewer explained. His foundation’s efforts are deeply rooted in Christian values, aiming to restore individuals to their rightful places within their families and communities. He emphasized, “Our goal is to get these men back in the house as fathers, so they can contribute positively to their communities.”</p>\n<p>A key aspect of Brewer’s critique involves the failure of secular systems to provide real, lasting solutions. He argued that secular therapies and treatments often fall short, stating, “I don’t see restored life in a lot of cases with modern psycho therapies and drugs. The gospel, on the other hand, provides a transformative experience that modern methods can’t match.” Brewer’s conviction is that true redemption and recovery come from spiritual transformation, which secular approaches lack.</p>\n<p>Brewer’s concern extends beyond individual rehabilitation to broader societal failures. He expressed frustration with the lack of church involvement in addressing critical social issues, such as the foster care system and educational deficiencies. “Why is the church not fulfilling the gap in these communities stricken by poverty?” he asked, pointing to the neglect of nearly 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system. Brewer attributes this gap to a broader decline in moral leadership within religious institutions. “We’ve taken the father out of the home, and with it, we’ve removed the spiritual and moral guidance that is crucial for nurturing strong families and communities.”</p>\n<p>His criticism also touches on the shifting cultural landscape and its impact on societal values. Brewer lamented the loss of traditional family structures and moral foundations, saying, “We’ve redefined love to fit a secular narrative, turning away from the biblical principles that once guided us.”</p>\n<p>This shift, according to Brewer, has led to a weakening of societal norms and an erosion of family values.</p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, Brewer remains hopeful and motivated by the results he has witnessed through his ministry. He highlighted success stories from his programs, where individuals have turned their lives around through faith. “We’ve had guys come off of death row who, once they find Christ, never return to their old ways,” Brewer shared. This testimony underscores his belief in the power of spiritual redemption over secular solutions.</p>\n<p>Brewer’s message is a call to action for both religious and secular communities to address these systemic issues with renewed vigor. He urges citizens to remain engaged and proactive, asserting, “We are serving for the future of this country and for our Lord and Savior.”</p>\n<p>His final words are a clarion call for reinvigorated moral and community leadership to bridge the gaps left by failed government policies and secular interventions.</p>\n<p>Brewer’s reflections highlight the profound impact of faith-based initiatives in addressing societal failures and the urgent need for a return to core values and active community involvement.</p>\n<p>His critique of government shortcomings and the secular approach to social issues reveals a pressing need for transformative solutions grounded in spiritual principles.</p>\n<p>For more on Jack Brewer, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Jack Brewer Breaks Down Where The Church Can Fulfill The Gaps Of Men In The Household</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The recent surge of violence in the UK, triggered by the murder of three young girls, has brought significant social unrest and a stark examination of the British justice system. The attacker, initially misreported as an immigrant, was later identified as a UK-born individual of Rwandan descent, a fact that intensified public outrage and led to widespread riots.</p>\n<p>Rick Munn, reporting from Ireland, has critically analyzed the aftermath of the violence and the ensuing government response, shedding light on what he describes as a \"two-tier” justice system. His observations underscore a troubling disparity in how the UK handles criminal acts and public disturbances based on their context and perpetrators.</p>\n<p>Munn noted the government’s aggressive stance in the wake of the riots: \"The British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been clear in his support for law enforcement, pledging increased police presence and rapid legal action against those involved in the violence.”</p>\n<p>Munn highlighted that authorities have prioritized early arrests and swift court appearances to demonstrate a zero-tolerance policy for the unrest. \"Starmer has promised that the full force of the law will be applied, emphasizing that ‘whatever the apparel motivation, this is not protest—it is pure violence,’” Munn quoted, emphasizing the government’s firm stance.</p>\n<p>Despite these measures, Munn raised serious concerns about perceived inconsistencies in the enforcement of justice. He criticized the differential treatment of various groups, noting that \"the handling of violence and protests has displayed a clear two-tier system.” This observation reflects a broader sentiment that some individuals and groups face harsher repercussions than others, depending on the nature of their actions and backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Munn provided a striking example of this discrepancy: \"Recently, footage surfaced of a police officer at Manchester Airport using excessive force on suspects who had previously assaulted officers. Despite the severity of the incident, the individuals involved were released on bail.” This situation contrasts sharply with the treatment of individuals involved in recent riots, who, according to Munn, are being remanded in custody and face more stringent legal scrutiny. \"The contrast is stark—those accused of violence in the riots are held in custody, while others involved in violent altercations with the police face comparatively lenient treatment,” Munn explained.</p>\n<p>This perceived imbalance has fueled criticism and frustration among the public. Munn pointed out that social media has amplified concerns about this inequity, with hashtags like \"#TwoTierKeir” gaining traction as people voice their frustrations with the justice system. \"The hashtag reflects a growing discontent with what many see as a biased application of the law,” Munn noted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two tier keir <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwoTierPolicing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TwoTierPolicing</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwoTierKier?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TwoTierKier</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeirStarmerisworsethanMaoandHitler?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KeirStarmerisworsethanMaoandHitler</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeirStarmerIsAMegalomaniac?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KeirStarmerIsAMegalomaniac</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/keiratarmerout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#keiratarmerout</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/getkeirstarmerout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#getkeirstarmerout</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetLabourOut?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GetLabourOut</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LabourAreDangerous?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LabourAreDangerous</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LabourPensionerGenocide?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LabourPensionerGenocide</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LabourIsUnfitToGovern?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LabourIsUnfitToGovern</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/labourout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#labourout</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.co/Cm4DOxMbeO\">https://t.co/Cm4DOxMbeO</a></p>\n<p>— Tanya  (@Tanya12510208) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tanya12510208/status/1820465982244053181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>\"The ongoing unrest and the government’s response underscore a deepening division within the UK’s approach to law and order,” he said.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On the WarRoom, Ben Harnwell and Dave Brat discussed the economic and political landscape of the United States on Tuesday. They highlighted the role of populism and Steve Bannon’s influence as a leader in the movement. The discussion shed light on Bannon’s unique vision and foresight in addressing the economic concerns of everyday Americans, particularly in swing states that are crucial for upcoming elections.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Brat, a former Congressman and current economic commentator applauded Steve Bannon’s leadership and foresight, stating, “Steve is the leader of leaders on this stuff. He saw way over the horizon and made all these play calls four years ago.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Brat emphasized Bannon’s role in anticipating economic challenges and advocating for solutions that resonate with a significant portion of the American populace. He credited Bannon with steering the populist movement toward addressing the “meat and potato issues” directly affecting citizens.</p>\n<p>Central to the discussion was the theme of populism, which has gained traction as an alternative to traditional political discourse. Brat remarked, “This is about a populist America. We have 75% of the people on board.” This sentiment underscores the widespread support for populism, which prioritizes the needs and concerns of ordinary citizens over those of the elite. According to Brat, Bannon has been instrumental in articulating this vision, providing a voice for those who feel marginalized by the establishment.</p>\n<p>Brat highlighted the economic issues at the forefront of the populist agenda, focusing on the Federal Reserve and government spending. He criticized their role in exacerbating economic instability, stating, “The Federal Reserve printed $9 trillion in money. They destroyed price stability, and the Federal Reserve destroyed economic growth.” This aligns with Bannon’s narrative of government mismanagement and the need for reforms that benefit the average American rather than the financial elite.</p>\n<p>The discussion also touched on the impact of these economic issues on swing states, which are vital for determining electoral outcomes. Brat explained, “When the economy does badly, it’s not an abstract. It’s about jobs, unemployment, and how much you’re going to be able to earn.” This focus on tangible economic concerns is central to Bannon’s approach, as he seeks to address the real-life impacts of economic policies on everyday Americans.</p>\n<p>Brat further elaborated on the wealth disparity that populism aims to tackle, noting, “Populist Americans are getting crushed. The top 10% own everything.” This statement highlights the economic inequality that fuels populist sentiments and drives the movement’s momentum. By advocating for policies that redistribute wealth and power, Bannon and his followers challenge the status quo and offer a new path forward.</p>\n<p>In this context, Bannon’s status as a political prisoner is framed as a badge of honor, reflecting his willingness to confront powerful interests and fight for the populist cause. Brat emphasized that Bannon’s legal battles have only strengthened his resolve and galvanized support for the movement he leads.</p>\n<p>Harnwell and Brat highlighted Steve Bannon’s pivotal role in the populist movement, emphasizing his commitment to economic reform and justice.</p>\n<p>To hear more watch the whole segment featuring Dave Brat and Ben Harnwell:</p>\n<h1>Brat Reveals Why Warren Buffet Is Selling Stocks Right Now, US Stock Market 59% Over Historic Norms</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In November 2023, on the WarRoom, before he was being held as a political prisoner, Steve Bannon addressed crucial issues facing the GOP. He emphasized the strategic focus needed for the upcoming November 2024 election.</p>\n<p>In his broadcast, Bannon sharply criticized the current GOP leadership for their handling of fiscal issues and election integrity, urging a radical shift in strategy and attitude. And he also reminded his audience about the importance of their vigilance in voting.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Turning to election strategy, Bannon stressed the importance of robust grassroots activism to support Trump’s campaign. He pointed out the GOP’s recent failures, including the loss of the White House in 2020 and the narrow Republican majority in the House, noting that “Trump will deliver the votes” and calling for a concerted effort to prevent any election manipulation. He emphasized that the focus should be on ensuring that votes are counted accurately, not just through elaborate theories but through practical measures: “We need to make sure that they’re not stolen.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As Bannon transitioned from his regular national commentator to a top podcaster and a more hands-on leader within GOP grassroots efforts in his force multiplier academy, he reminded us of the critical need for organized local action to complement Trump’s efforts.</p>\n<p>He pointed to the importance of uniting under the local party structures and emphasized that addressing local issues is vital for broader electoral success. “The grassroots want to make a difference,” Bannon concluded, urging supporters to engage actively in local politics to drive national change.</p>\n<p>During the segment, Bannon condemned the idea of a clean Continuing Resolution (CR) in Congress, labeling it an unacceptable compromise. He argued that “a clean CR is impossible” and warned against the disastrous effects of maintaining a two-trillion-dollar deficit, asserting, “You have two trillion dollars last Thursday was a debacle.” He criticized the lack of meaningful fiscal cuts and expressed skepticism about optimistic financial projections, saying, “I did an investment banking long enough to know when it is BS.”</p>\n<p>Bannon also urged Republicans to break free from fear and media influence. “Stop being petrified by the unit party,” he said, encouraging GOP members to engage boldly in their duties and make their voices heard. He criticized some members’ “petrified” nature and called for a more assertive, more decisive approach.</p>\n<p>BANNON WAS RIGHT</p>\n<p>Highlighting the broader implications of current policies, Bannon warned of a looming economic and geopolitical crisis, comparing the situation to a biblical apocalypse: “You gotta start at the beginning, go to the end, go. The last part, is that where we are expanding third world war.”</p>\n<p>Bannon’s remarks paint a picture of urgency and strategic recalibration as Republicans prepare for the 2024 elections, with a clear focus on reclaiming lost ground and ensuring the integrity of the voting process.</p>\n<p>Here is a flashback from Bannon, now a political prisoner, who 8 months ago was telling the WarRoom to get ready to go and vote:</p>\n<h1>Bannon: “Trump will deliver the votes, we need to make sure they’re not stolen”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Monday morning, in a WarRoom discussion, Charlie Kirk strongly critiqued the current economic situation under the Biden administration while championing the rising star of conservative politics, JD Vance. Kirk, known for his influential role as the host of “Turning Point” and his work in mobilizing young voters, offered a compelling analysis of both political and economic dynamics affecting America.</p>\n<p>Kirk’s admiration for JD Vance was evident as he recounted a recent rally in Glendale, Arizona, where Vance’s appeal was on full display.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>He noted, \"I came to the rally about an hour before it started, and there were at least 2,000 people who couldn’t get in.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the sweltering 108-degree heat, the overwhelming turnout highlighted Vance’s strong grassroots support. Kirk praised Vance as a \"rock star” and \"one of the greatest political talents” in the conservative movement, reflecting his belief that Vance’s ability to connect with the American Heartland stems from his personal experience of overcoming adversity. \"JD Vance is really hitting his stride,” Kirk said, emphasizing Vance’s effectiveness in reaching out to voters who feel neglected by the political establishment.</p>\n<p>Kirk’s discussion also focused on the economic struggles facing young Americans under the Biden administration. He criticized the current state of the economy, describing it as a severe challenge for young people trying to achieve traditional milestones such as homeownership. \"If you thought it was hard to own a home before, just how about now?” Kirk questioned.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that the annual income required to buy a single-family home has soared from $75,000 to $130,000, underscoring the significant financial pressure on younger generations. Kirk blamed the Biden administration’s economic policies, dubbing them as detrimental to the financial well-being of young people.</p>\n<p>According to Kirk, the economic hardship faced by young voters is exacerbated by what he called \"Kamala Harris’s” vision of a rental economy. \"Kamala Harris wants to create a nation of renters,” Kirk argued, suggesting that the current administration’s policies are pushing people away from home ownership and toward a more transient lifestyle. He portrayed this as part of a broader pattern of economic mismanagement that has eroded the American Dream for many young people.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Kirk lauded former President Donald Trump’s economic proposals as a beacon of hope. He asserted that Trump’s approach is designed to revitalize the American economy and restore opportunities for young people. \"Donald Trump wants to revitalize the backbone of this Great Nation,” Kirk said, emphasizing Trump’s commitment to making homeownership and financial stability achievable again. Kirk called on younger voters to support Trump, arguing that he is the only candidate capable of reversing the current economic malaise. \"If the younger generation wants to be rich like their parents, they have to vote Trump,” Kirk declared, reinforcing his belief that Trump’s policies offer a path to economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Kirk’s remarks encapsulate a stark critique of Bidenomics and a passionate endorsement of JD Vance’s growing political influence.</p>\n<h1>Kirk Reveals The “Subterranean Cultural Indicator” That Americans Are Loving J.D.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Every time I think the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) cannot become any more irrelevant, they prove me wrong.</p>\n<p>I have been a member of the organization for decades, despite many temptations to cancel my membership because their leadership has made a conscious decision to become an \"unofficial” part of the Democrat Party and no longer a \"professional” organization.</p>\n<p>If you need any evidence of my assertion, one need only look at the debacle that took place at their national conference in Chicago last week.</p>\n<p>NABJ has a new president, Ken Lemon. I do not know him and since he is new to his position, I will reserve judgement of him at this time. But I will give him a great deal of credit for displaying wise leadership for inviting presidential candidate Donald Trump to address their convention, as he did Kamala Harris, the Democrat candidate. Trump accepted and Harris declined. So much for Democrats valuing radical liberal Black voters like members of NABJ.</p>\n<p>The mere fact that inviting Trump caused so much controversy within the group shows their radical liberal bias! Despite the loud protest from its radical liberal Democrat members, Lemon stood his ground and the Trump invitation was not rescinded.</p>\n<p>But where Lemon did show his radical liberal bias was how he structured the meeting with Trump. He was pressured into being soooooo politically correct that he chose three Black female reporters to do the interview: Rachel Scott from ABC News, Harris Faulker from FOX NEWS, and Kadia Goba from Semafor.</p>\n<p>The continued marginalization of the Black male, by a group led by a Black male. Go figure!\nHow do you justify not having any male reporters participating, but I digress? As of this writing, NABA has refused to confirm what the agreed upon terms of the panel discussion were.</p>\n<p>Trump has said one thing and NABJ has said another. Neither side has shown anything that could be confirmed; thus, the event continues to be a royal mess.</p>\n<p>For those who have yet to see the event, you can watch on C-SPAN. Do not use any other source as it\nwill most likely be edited to reflect certain political bias. Rachel Scott, from ABC News, thoroughly embarrassed herself and the profession of journalism with her \"sista” girl tactics.</p>\n<p>She was totally rude and disrespectful to Trump right out the gate. You do not have to like Trump, but he is still a former president. She was attempting to make her bones off Trump and he totally destroyed her like he did Kaitlan Collins from CNN a couple of months earlier!</p>\n<p>One of the oldest unwritten rules of journalism is that the reporter should never become part of the story. Unfortunately, in today’s world, journalists seek to be not just a part of the story; they now want to be the story. This is why most Americans do not trust or respect the media.</p>\n<p>This was Trump’s \"Sister Souljah” moment on steroids!!! A Sister Souljah moment is simply when you go to a group’s convention and denounce a prominent member of their organization to curry favor with another demographic group that has no affiliation with the group you are speaking to.</p>\n<p>So, in 1992 presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, attended Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Push’s annual conference and denounced rapper Sister Souljah to curry favor with white moderate Democrats; and it got him elected president in 1992!</p>\n<p>In this instance, Rachel Scott was Sister Souljah and got her butt wiped across the floor by Donald Trump. Unfortunately, most Black professional groups have all decided to be a part of the Democrat Party versus a professional group.</p>\n<p>This explains why they are all hurting for money and have little to no influence within the industries they are supposed to be a part of. NABJ absolutely does not represent the rank and file in the Black community and are in constant violation of the Society of Professional Journalist’s code of ethics (SPJ).</p>\n<p>SPJ is the governing body for all things journalism. Their code of ethics has been considered the Bible of journalism for decades.</p>\n<p>If NABJ were lawyers or certified public accountants (CPAs), they would lose their license because they\nare in constant violations of their own code of ethics. Many NABJ members call me when they cannot get Republicans to return their calls when they are working on stories.</p>\n<p>When Republicans get calls from Black reporters, whether they work for Black or mainstream media, their default position is that it is going to be a hit piece; therefore, they are reluctant to return the call. This view by Republicans is not without merit! I think NABJ and many Black reporters have definitely earned this reputation.’</p>\n<p>As I am wont to say, radical liberal groups like NABJ and radical liberal Democrat operatives like Roland Martin, Joy Reid, April Ryan, Laura Coats, and Abby Phillip, etc., do more harm to the Black community than anybody with a white hood over their face.</p>\n<p>NABJ constantly plays the race card and constantly complains about the lack of \"diversity” within mainstream media and their executive suites; yet they are guilty of doing the same thing they accuse the big boys of doing.</p>\n<p>Where is the \"ideological” diversity within NABJ?</p>\n<p>Why are all their national, regional, and local conferences all stacked with 99% radical liberal Democrat speakers and panelists? A couple of years ago, they allowed Planned Parenthood to sponsor a panel at their national convention in support of abortion. Yes, you heard me right!</p>\n<p>NABJ pushes a radical liberal agenda and I have talked with their leadership incessantly, to no avail.\nTheir leadership is very well aware of my connections at the highest levels of the Republican Party, but leadership never comes to me for input as they are planning their conferences.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Before Steve Bannon was forced to surrender as a political prisoner, he delivered remarks to the WarRoom audience that exposed precisely why the Democrats wanted to see him censored and shackled in a Federal correctional facility for the last four months leading up to the historic 2024 election.</p>\n<p>Using his expertise as a financial expert, Bannon has deconstructed the corporate media’s messaging on government spending so that every layperson can understand and vote accordingly.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon has frequently stated, \"The citizens of the United States should not be in bondage to anything. Any institution. Any instrument like money. Nothing.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The following is a flashback, some vintage Bannon, from late June 2024, where Bannon ripped apart the corporate media’s messaging and trashed an Axios article meant to gaslight voters:</p>\n<p>Bannon’s comments on the Democrats’ foreign funding and what he describes as “bondage for the American people” are a powerful critique of the current political landscape. Bannon, known for his fiery rhetoric and unapologetic defense of populism, has consistently voiced concerns about the influence of globalists and foreign interests in American politics. He argues that this influence is detrimental to the sovereignty and well-being of the United States and its citizens.</p>\n<p>During the June broadcast of the WarRoom, Bannon argued that the Democratic Party has become a tool for globalist interests, funded by foreign billionaires who seek to undermine the American way of life. In his view, this foreign funding creates a situation where the American people are placed in “bondage” to global financial systems and markets.</p>\n<p>Bannon believes that this financial bondage is a new form of slavery, where Americans are shackled by debt and fiscal irresponsibility orchestrated by political elites in cahoots with globalists. He passionately claims, “These Federal spending [programs] are bondage. It’s the new slavery. It’s bondage to world debt markets and world capital markets.”</p>\n<p>Bannon has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s economic policies, accusing him of leading the country into massive debt. According to Bannon, the Biden administration’s approach to fiscal policy is reckless, causing inflation and hardship for ordinary Americans. He contrasts this with what he sees as the “golden age” of the Trump administration, citing low inflation and interest rates as indicators of economic prosperity.</p>\n<p>In a pointed critique on that program, Bannon emphasized, “They are telling bald-face lies about how much debt Joe Biden’s front versus Donald Trump, and we’re getting experts to break that down.” He specifically calls out Axios, a media outlet, for perpetuating what he sees as misinformation about the national debt under Biden.</p>\n<p>Bannon is not just a critic but a strategist who calls for decisive actions. He advocates for a government shutdown to force a national conversation about fiscal responsibility. He argues that the American people need to wake up to the reality that they are being manipulated and financially enslaved by policies that benefit only the wealthy elite.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s call to action is clear: “Shut the freaking government down and force a national conversation because I guarantee you when we show the American people that they’re held in bondage by this irresponsible fiscal madness that only enriches the wealthy, they’ll demand change.”</p>\n<p>Bannon blamed globalists for gutting the American middle class and creating an economy that favors the Fortune 100 CEOs at the expense of ordinary citizens. He accuses these global elites of caring more about profits and control than about the well-being of American workers. “Globals, bring jobs back to America. You suck. The money comes. You send it back. Return to sender. We don’t want your greasy stolen money,” Bannon passionately states.</p>\n<p>Bannon is also highly critical of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which he claims has been embraced by Democrats to justify endless spending without concern for deficits. He believes that MMT is a dangerous ideology that ignores the real-world consequences of unchecked government spending. “They embrace modern monetary theory. That deficits don’t matter. It don’t matter, and now they’re scared,” Bannon argues, emphasizing that the American public is beginning to see through these economic illusions.</p>\n<p>To bolster his arguments, Bannon cites economists and frequent WarRoom guests like Steve Moore, E.J. Antoni, <a href=\"https://warroom.org/its-as-bad-as-the-1970s-economic-divide-and-the-pathway-out-scott-bessent-analyzes-the-u-s-economy-with-don-jr/\">Scott Bessent</a>, and Dave Brat. He believes these experts provide a clearer picture of the country’s economic challenges and the dangers of the current fiscal policies. “I’m gonna get Steve Moore, Scott Bessent, E.J. Antoni, and Dave Brat, because here’s what’s happened in the last 24-40 hours,” Bannon states, indicating his reliance on these voices to dismantle the narratives he sees as misleading.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s fiery defense of the American people appears rooted in his belief that foreign interests and globalist agendas are compromising the nation’s sovereignty and economic future.</p>\n<p>He sees this as a betrayal of the United States’ foundational values and calls for a radical reevaluation of its fiscal policies. His comments serve as a rallying cry for those who feel disenfranchised by the current political and economic systems, urging them to demand accountability and change.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment with corporate media cold opens and Bannon’s remarks:</p>\n<h1>Bannon Calls Out The Globalists’ Crimes Against The American People</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent discussion on The War Room, Dave Brat hosted China expert Gordon Chang to explore the complex and often dangerous geopolitical dynamics involving China, the United States, and other global actors. The conversation centered around China’s strategic ambitions and current geopolitical maneuvers, painting a picture of a nation with grand territorial aspirations and a precarious economic backdrop that fuels its aggressive posture.</p>\n<p>Chang argued that the world is facing its most dangerous time in history, even more so than the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We knew then that Khrushchev and Kennedy were unwilling to use their nukes; we don’t know that about Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, and Vladimir Putin,” Chang warned. He criticized the current U.S. administration, stating, “We have a president who has checked out and is not defending our country.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Chang opened the conversation by addressing a debate regarding China’s desire for war. Colonel Derrick Harvey had<a href=\"https://warroom.org/essential-insights-for-voters-col-derek-harveys-key-warnings-on-iran-china-and-u-s-domestic-challenges/\"> previously </a><span><a href=\"https://warroom.org/essential-insights-for-voters-col-derek-harveys-key-warnings-on-iran-china-and-u-s-domestic-challenges/\">argued in the show</a></span> that China does not want a war, particularly a kinetic one, because it would threaten its own existence.</p>\n<p>However, Chang emphasized that while China may not seek direct military conflict, its actions signal a broader ambition for global dominance.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“China doesn’t want a kinetic war. What it wants is to annex territories of other nations,” Chang asserted. He further elaborated that China’s ultimate goal is to “destroy the United States” and “rule the moon and Mars as sovereign Chinese territory” without resorting to war.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Chang explained that China is actively engaging in activities akin to warfare through proxy conflicts and territorial intimidation. “China is fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine, fueling Iran’s attacks on Israel, and along with Russia, it’s fueling insurgencies in North Africa,” Chang noted. He highlighted China’s belligerent activities toward the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and India as potential preludes to direct conflict.</p>\n<p>According to Chang, the political system in China has inherent incentives to pursue aggressive expansion, either through intimidation or territorial annexation.</p>\n<p>Dave Brat pointed out that China’s extensive geopolitical ventures rely heavily on a robust economy, which appears to be weakening. “The Chinese economy is not growing at the 4.7% pace they claim for the second quarter of this year; it’s barely above zero, if that,” Brat observed.</p>\n<p>Chang agreed, adding that the economic downturn inhibits China’s ability to finance its military and international projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. This economic strain makes China even more dangerous, as President Xi Jinping faces mounting pressure for a quick victory to consolidate his power.</p>\n<p>Xi Jinping, Chang explained, is in a precarious position domestically. He has centralized power, making him accountable for the country’s economic woes. “Xi Jinping realizes that he’s being blamed for the economy, the demographic problems, and everything else,” Chang stated.</p>\n<p>This personal accountability means Xi is at risk politically, driving him to seek quick victories to silence dissent within the Communist Party. Chang warned that Xi’s domestic incentives are “to be belligerent and provocative, which means he can take us by surprise.”</p>\n<p>When asked about where Xi might seek a quick victory, Chang identified the Philippines as a likely target due to its perceived vulnerability. “A war on Taiwan would be very difficult and unpopular with the Chinese people,” Chang explained. “But with the Philippines, he thinks they’re an easy target.” He noted recent acts of aggression, including the seizure of Philippine vessels and the injuring of Filipino sailors, as potential precursors to more significant conflict.</p>\n<p>Chang’s insights expose a world where China’s economic struggles and internal political pressures could lead to unexpected and potentially catastrophic global conflicts. As Chang’s analysis reveals, understanding China’s motivations and potential actions is crucial for navigating the current geopolitical landscape.</p>\n<p>Chang’s new book, Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America, will be published by Newsmax on October 1st. It promises to explore these themes further, offering readers a detailed examination of China’s strategies and their implications for global security.</p>\n<p>For more, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Gordan Chang:</p>\n<h1>Gordon Chang: The CCP “Wants To Rule The Moon And Mars As Sovereign Chinese Territory Without War”</h1>\n</div>\n"

She told President Trump, in the wake of being shot in an assassination attempt, his courage is contagious.</p>\n<p>\"Your courage is contagious, too,” he said.</p>\n<p>President Trump specifically praised the group for voting to <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1810768042248536298?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>approve</span></a> a rule change that requires the votes to be hand counted by three poll officers at the precinct level every day of voting to ensure the numbers match with the machines.</p>\n<p>\"Who could be against that?” President Trump said.</p>\n<p>Maybe the ones still covering up 2020. The three hand counts at the precinct level <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>differed so significantly</span></a> that President Trump’s Election Day totals were off by nearly 50 percent in some cases. The tabulation machines undercounted these votes both times. Phillip Stark, a renowned statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who created the risk limiting audit, said the \"large, unexplained differences among these results” left voters with no confidence their voters were \"counted at all, much less counted as cast.”</p>\n<p>The second machine count and the hand count audit were thousands of votes short when they tried to recreate their purported results in Fulton County. Two State Election Board cases, SEB2021-181 and SEB2023-025, have proven the hand count audit included over 4,081 false votes for Joe Biden, and that the second machine count included thousands of duplicate votes. However, the Secretary of State’s office has tried to sweep both cases under the rug. Though Kemp and his office are keenly aware of the details of the fraudulent hand count, since they are the ones who confirmed Joe Rossi’s findings and sent a letter to the State Election Board which prompted the opening of the SEB2021-181 case, little has been done to ensure it can’t happen again in 2024.</p>\n<p>Raffensperger and his general counsel Charlene McGowan are still claiming all three counts matched. The final count includes only 506,948 votes, far less than the certified 527,925 that includes 17,852 missing ballot images from tabulators that do not exist, and the aforementioned duplicates. McGowan falsely claimed it was \"inconclusive” whether or not the over 3,125 duplicates were counted, when in fact there is evidence that not only were they counted, but were <a href=\"https://warroom.org/report-3930-duplicates-in-fulton-county-in-2020-were-intentional-fraud/\"><span>intentionally and fraudulently</span></a>inserted into the official results. Removing the false votes from both cases would be enough to alter the outcome of 2020, which was claimed to be decided by 11,779 votes.</p>\n<p>The State Election Board has an <a href=\"https://x.com/kevinmoncla/status/1819921814933385444?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>opportunity</span></a> to continue the investigation into SEB2023-025, which documented all of these major discrepancies and the fact that the results were sent to an outside \"consultant” working for the Elections Group, a <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>shadowy organization</span></a> that \"chose Fulton County” when they popped up in cities in the major Swing States during the pivotal 2020 Election. The matter will be brought up at the next Board meeting on Tuesday, Aug. 6.</p>\n<p>President Trump called out Raffensperger and Kemp for wanting Georgia to be stolen again.</p>\n<p>\"Raffensperger ought to make sure that the vote is honest,” he said. \"They don’t want the vote to be honest. In my opinion, they want us to lose. And we can’t let that happen.”</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Saturday’s WarRoom program, with host Dave Brat, Dr. Bradley Thayer addressed three key topics regarding China’s influence and threat to global stability.</p>\n<p>Thayer told Brat that he concurs with Colonel John Mills’s analysis that “China is behind” most global hotspots, emphasizing that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is akin to Reagan’s view of the Soviet Union as “the center of evil in the modern world.” Thayer argues that China’s political and military strategies are designed to “undermine the United States and our interests,” highlighting their expansion into Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia as part of their broader plan to overthrow the U.S. and its allies.</p>\n<p>The following is an expanded discussion on each of the three points addressed by Thayer in the conversation with Dave Brat that are most important to understand about confronting the Chinese Communist Party:</p>\n<p><strong>1. China’s Role in Global Hotspots</strong>\nThayer argues that China is a major instigator of global instability, asserting that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is actively “igniting and sustaining a lot of these conflicts.” He agrees with Colonel John Mills’s analysis, which identifies China as a key player behind geopolitical tensions worldwide, including those in regions like the Caribbean, South America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to Thayer, China’s influence is a direct threat to U.S. interests and global stability. He likens China’s current role to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, referencing Reagan’s view that the Soviet Union was “the center of evil in the modern world.” Thayer warns that China’s support for regimes like Russia and Iran is part of a broader strategy to undermine Western power and influence.</p>\n<p>He emphasizes the significance of China’s strategic alliances, highlighting its “political warfare strength” and “military capabilities” as instruments used to destabilize regions and challenge U.S. hegemony. Thayer argues that “the fundamental point is to overthrow the United States,” highlighting the CCP’s intent to displace the U.S. as a global leader. He stresses the need to recognize the CCP as the primary driver of these global conflicts, suggesting that the CCP’s actions are designed to create a world order that favors authoritarian regimes. This calls for a concerted effort to counter China’s influence by recognizing the CCP as an illegitimate government that seeks to expand its power through “tyrannical methods.” Thayer calls for a coalition of “people of goodwill around the world” to combat the CCP’s ambitions and protect democratic values globally.</p>\n<p><strong>2. China’s Economic and Military Strength</strong>\nThayer discussed China’s economic and military capabilities, highlighting both its strengths and vulnerabilities. He notes the mixed reports about China’s economic health, acknowledging the presence of “negative news on the economy” while also recognizing China’s “intelligent long-range plans” like the Belt and Road Initiative. Thayer points out that China has rapidly grown its economy over the past decades, converting this economic power into significant military and diplomatic strength. He argues that this expansion has enabled China to exert influence across the globe, making it a formidable adversary to the United States and its allies.</p>\n<p>Despite the reports of economic decline, Thayer cautions against underestimating China’s potential. He states that “their economy has stalled,” but emphasizes that the CCP has accumulated substantial resources and power, allowing them to “convert that wealth into military might, diplomatic power, and technology.” This growth has positioned China as a major global player, capable of challenging the U.S. in various domains. Thayer warns that under Xi Jinping’s leadership, China is particularly dangerous, describing Xi as a “hyper-aggressive leader” who is willing to take risks to advance China’s interests. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing this threat and calls for strategic actions to counter China’s influence.</p>\n<p>Thayer urges the U.S. to “cut off any investment with China” and focus on bolstering its own economy. He highlights the danger posed by Xi’s aggressive policies, warning that the CCP is likely to become “very aggressive” against the U.S. and its allies. Thayer’s analysis underscores the need for vigilance and strategic planning in addressing the challenges posed by China’s economic and military ambitions.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The Nature of the CCP and the Threat to the U.S.</strong>\nThayer highlighted the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as an existential threat to the United States, arguing that China is “at war with us today” through political warfare. He parallels the Cold War dynamics with the Soviet Union, asserting that China is engaged in a strategic conflict with the U.S., albeit not through direct military confrontation. Thayer warns that China has declared a “people’s war” against the United States, signaling its intent to undermine American sovereignty and global influence.</p>\n<p>Thayer criticizes the CCP as an “illegitimate government” that rules through oppressive means and does not represent the Chinese people’s will. He points to historical events like Mao Zedong’s intentional famine, which resulted in the death of millions, as evidence of the regime’s disregard for human life. Thayer emphasizes that the CCP’s aggressive policies are driven by an ideology that prioritizes party interests over the well-being of the Chinese populace. He argues that the CCP’s actions are aimed at destabilizing the U.S. and promoting an authoritarian world order.</p>\n<p>To counter this threat, Thayer advocates for a robust response from the U.S. and its allies. He urges policymakers to “stop investments and trade with China,” focusing instead on strengthening domestic industries and building alliances with “people of goodwill” worldwide.</p>\n<p>Thayer emphasizes the importance of recognizing the CCP as a dangerous adversary and taking decisive actions to neutralize its influence. He calls for a collective effort to oppose the CCP’s ambitions and safeguard democratic values, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to counter China’s global influence.</p>\n<p>Watch the full interview from Saturday’s WarRoom program:</p>\n<h1>Bradley Thayer Hammers Necessity To Confront Illegitimate CCP Regime</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The erosion of civil liberties in the modern era is intricately linked to the rise of an expansive administrative state, which increasingly seeks to manipulate public discourse and media landscapes to align with its narratives.</p>\n<p>On Saturday’s WarRoom, discussions between Mike Benz and Dave Brat highlighted a concerning trend: the systematic suppression of alternative news sources by leveraging governmental and corporate power to enforce compliance with a state-sanctioned narrative.</p>\n<p>On the program, Benz shed light on the aggressive tactics government agencies and their allies used to undermine independent media. According to Benz, the post-2016 election landscape saw a concerted effort by entities such as the U.S. State Department and various NGOs to stifle alternative media.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“After the 2016 election, the Health Security State and the foreign policy establishment embarked on a quest to kill advertising revenue to alternative news sources,” Benz stated.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He explained that this strategy was aimed at diminishing the influence of independent outlets that had gained traction against traditional media giants.</p>\n<p>Benz’s latest report exposes a troubling alliance between censorship mercenary firms and major advertising agencies. “Censorship mercenary firms like NewsGuard and Global Disinformation Index now rate news organizations in a manner similar to Moody’s rating bonds,” Benz noted.</p>\n<p>These firms create blacklists of websites deemed to spread misinformation, effectively directing advertising dollars away from these sources. This tactic not only cripples independent journalism but also consolidates media power within a few government-approved channels.</p>\n<p>Benz criticized the government’s role in funding media operations that align with its objectives while marginalizing dissenting voices. “The government should not be in the business of determining winners and losers in the media landscape,” Benz argued. He highlighted how taxpayer money is used to support media organizations that propagate the administration’s preferred narratives, thus skewing public perception and undermining democratic discourse.</p>\n<p>Brat echoed these concerns, emphasizing the need for voters to be aware of these dynamics. “When you see the rise of these censorship practices and the manipulation of media funding, it’s a red flag for civil liberties,” Brat remarked.</p>\n<p>He urged citizens to scrutinize how administrative state actions could impact their rights and the integrity of public debate.</p>\n<p>As the 2024 elections approach, it is crucial for voters to consider the implications of an administrative state that seeks to control the flow of information and stifle dissenting voices. The tactics employed by government entities and their corporate allies reflect a broader agenda to enforce conformity and suppress alternative viewpoints, posing a significant threat to individual freedoms and the democratic process.</p>\n<p>The discussion between Benz and Brat is a stark reminder of the challenges facing civil liberties in an age of heightened governmental control. As voters prepare for the upcoming elections, they should be mindful of the broader implications of these trends and advocate for a media landscape that supports diverse and independent voices. The health of democracy depends on it.</p>\n<p>For fuller context, watch the Mike Benz interview on the WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Mike Benz: The Four-Letter Agencies Are Killing The Ability To Operate An Independent Website</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Saturday’s WarRoom  Ret. Col. Derek Harvey addressed a number of the critical issues Americans should be considering before the November election.</p>\n<p>Here are some notes from Harvey’s appearance with host, Dave Brat and the topics they discussed:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Iran’s Threat to Israel and Regional Instability</strong>\nHarvey emphasized Iran’s orchestrated campaign against Israel, aiming to destabilize the region through proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. According to Harvey, Iran is seeking revenge for past assassinations and is planning a “multi-front campaign” that could pose significant risks to Israeli security and regional stability.</p>\n<p>“Iran is not acting alone,” Harvey stated. “They are using Hezbollah and Hamas as proxies to open up a multi-front campaign against Israel. Their objective is not just about retaliation; it’s about exerting influence and destabilizing the region to weaken American allies.” He elaborated on Iran’s strategic objectives, explaining how their actions are part of a broader effort to erode U.S. influence in the Middle East and undermine alliances such as the Abraham Accords.</p>\n<p>He highlighted the potential for increased conflict, emphasizing the need for the U.S. and its allies to be vigilant. “Iran’s actions are calculated and deliberate,” he said, “and they have a long-term vision to drive wedges between the U.S. and its partners in the region.”</p>\n<p>Harvey also warned of Iran’s ambitions to expand its influence beyond the Middle East. “Iran is looking to assert itself as a regional power with global reach,” he remarked. “Their ambitions are not limited to Israel; they are a threat to broader regional stability and, by extension, global peace.”</p>\n<p>Harvey’s analysis of Iran’s threat shows the complexities of Middle Eastern geopolitics and the urgent need for strategic responses to counter Iran’s ambitions. The multi-front campaign against Israel serves as a reminder of Iran’s relentless pursuit of regional dominance and the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The Role of China and Russia</strong>\nHarvey highlighted the significant roles China and Russia play in undermining U.S. influence in the Middle East. He explained that these powers are leveraging regional instability to expand their influence and challenge Western dominance. “China and Russia are not just passive observers in the Middle East,” Harvey asserted. “They are actively working to undermine U.S. influence and disrupt the existing power dynamics.”</p>\n<p>He described how China, in particular, is making strategic moves to align itself with key players in the region, emphasizing its economic and military investments. “China is looking to build alliances through economic ties and military cooperation,” Harvey explained. “They are using initiatives like the Belt and Road to increase their footprint and challenge U.S. interests.”</p>\n<p>Similarly, he noted Russia’s actions in the region, highlighting their support for regimes that oppose U.S. policies. “Russia is playing a dangerous game,” Harvey stated. “They are backing authoritarian regimes and using their influence to sow discord among U.S. allies.”</p>\n<p>Harvey stressed that the actions of China and Russia are not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy to diminish U.S. influence globally. “This is a coordinated effort,” he said. “China and Russia are working in tandem to reshape the global order in their favor.”</p>\n<p>In his view, this geopolitical maneuvering poses significant challenges for the U.S. and its allies. “We must recognize that the battle for influence is not just about military might but also about economic and political power,” Harvey concluded. “The U.S. needs to be proactive in countering these threats and ensuring that its alliances remain strong and resilient.”</p>\n<p><strong>3. China’s Global Ambitions and Internal Challenges</strong>\nHarvey exposed China’s global ambitions, emphasizing its strategic efforts to expand its influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road. However, he also pointed out China’s internal weaknesses that could hinder its long-term goals. “China’s ambitions are clear,” Harvey stated. “They seek to expand their global reach, but they face significant internal challenges that cannot be ignored.”</p>\n<p>He discussed China’s geopolitical strategies, highlighting its efforts to form alliances and project power on a global scale. “China is not just focusing on the military,” Harvey explained. “They are leveraging economic power and soft diplomacy to create a network of alliances that serve their interests.”</p>\n<p>Despite these ambitions, Harvey noted several internal challenges China faces, including economic debt, demographic issues, and a lack of innovation. “China’s growth is not sustainable,” he argued. “Their economic model is burdened with debt, and their aging population poses a significant demographic challenge.”</p>\n<p>Harvey also pointed out that China’s technological advancements often rely on copying rather than innovating. “China’s innovation is not as robust as it appears,” he said. “They are still heavily reliant on acquiring technology from other countries.”</p>\n<p>In his analysis, these internal challenges could limit China’s ability to achieve its long-term objectives. “China’s path to global dominance is not assured,” Harvey concluded. “Their internal vulnerabilities are significant, and they will need to address these issues to sustain their ambitions.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Harvey’s insights into China’s global ambitions and internal challenges highlight the complexities of modern geopolitics. While China’s strategies pose a challenge to U.S. interests, its internal weaknesses could offer opportunities for the U.S. to counterbalance China’s influence and maintain global stability.</p>\n<p><strong>4. U.S. Domestic Political Challenges</strong>\nHe talked about significant domestic political challenges in the U.S., particularly the lack of strategic planning in the previous Trump administration and the necessity for loyal personnel. “The Trump administration had a bold agenda, but it often lacked the strategic planning necessary to implement it effectively,” Harvey said. He pointed to the failure to deliver on key promises, such as repealing Obamacare, as examples of these challenges.</p>\n<p>He emphasized the importance of having a cohesive administration aligned with the president’s goals, criticizing the appointment of officials who may not fully support the administration’s agenda. “Personnel is policy,” Harvey stated. “Without the right people in place, even the best plans can falter.”</p>\n<p>Harvey also discussed the role of the  Administrative State and bureaucratic resistance to change. “The administrative state is a formidable force,” he explained. “It’s essential to have loyal personnel who understand the president’s vision and are committed to executing it.”</p>\n<p>He argued that the lack of strategic foresight and unity in the administration often led to missed opportunities and political setbacks. “There was a disconnect between the president’s ambitions and the execution on the ground,” Harvey remarked.</p>\n<p>In his view, future administrations must learn from these challenges and prioritize strategic planning and personnel loyalty. “The lessons of the past should guide future leaders,” Harvey concluded. “To succeed, we need an administration that is not only united in purpose but also adept at navigating the complexities of governance.”</p>\n<p>Harvey’s analysis of U.S. domestic political challenges underscores the importance of strategic foresight, personnel alignment, and a unified approach to implementing policies. His insights highlight the need for strong leadership and a cohesive administration to overcome bureaucratic resistance and achieve meaningful change.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Deep State and Administrative Complexities</strong>\nHarvey addressed the challenges posed by the Deep State and the complexities of the U.S. government bureaucracy, emphasizing the need for strong leadership and clear strategies. “Navigating the administrative state is no small task,” Harvey stated. “It requires leadership that is not only decisive but also understands the intricacies of governance.”</p>\n<p>He highlighted the importance of having a committed team that aligns with the administration’s goals, particularly in dealing with bureaucratic resistance. “The Deep State is a reality,” Harvey asserted. “It’s a powerful force that can stymie even the most well-intentioned reforms.”</p>\n<p>Harvey pointed out the necessity for a close-knit group of advisors who understand the political landscape and are committed to executing the administration’s vision. “Loyalty and alignment are crucial,” he emphasized. “Without them, the best-laid plans can be derailed by entrenched interests within the bureaucracy.”</p>\n<p>He also discussed the challenges of implementing policies in the face of institutional inertia, highlighting the need for strategic foresight and a clear understanding of the bureaucratic landscape. “The complexities of government require a nuanced approach,” Harvey explained. “It’s about more than just policy; it’s about execution and overcoming resistance.”</p>\n<p>In his view, overcoming these challenges requires a unified administration with strong leadership and a clear strategy. “The path to meaningful change is fraught with obstacles,” Harvey concluded. “But with the right team and a clear vision, it is possible to navigate the complexities of the administrative state and achieve significant progress.”</p>\n<p>Harvey’s insights into the Deep State and administrative complexities really show the importance of strategic leadership and personnel alignment. His analysis highlights the need for a cohesive approach to governance, recognizing the challenges posed by bureaucratic resistance and the necessity of a committed team to implement meaningful reforms.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Need for Strategic Foresight</strong>\nHarvey emphasized the importance of strategic foresight in preparing for future administrations, warning that without it, future leaders might face the same obstacles that plagued previous ones. “Strategic foresight is not a luxury; it’s a necessity,” Harvey stated. “Without it, administrations are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.”</p>\n<p>He highlighted the importance of a close-knit group of advisors who understand the political landscape and are committed to the administration’s goals. “The right team is essential,” Harvey explained. “They need to be aligned with the president’s vision and capable of executing it effectively.”</p>\n<p>Harvey discussed the challenges of navigating the complexities of governance, emphasizing the need for strategic planning and personnel loyalty. “The political landscape is complex and ever-changing,” he remarked. “Having a strategic plan and a committed team is crucial to navigating these challenges.”</p>\n<p>He also warned of the dangers of failing to address bureaucratic resistance and institutional inertia, highlighting the necessity of strong leadership and a clear strategy. “Bureaucratic resistance is a reality that must be overcome,” Harvey asserted. “It’s about more than just policy; it’s about execution and overcoming entrenched interests.”</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire 2-Part, interview from Saturday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Col.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Saturday’s WarRoom, William Federer’s discussion with Dave Brat exposed the unique American conception of individual rights and contrasted it sharply with contemporary leftist views centered on group identity and the points they made are crucial for an educated society to have when considering who they should vote for in the next election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The founders of America looked to the pre-King Saul part of the Bible, where people were directly accountable to God, not to an earthly ruler. When we understand that our rights come from a Creator, not the state, we recognize that our leadership and voting decisions should uphold the principle of individual rights over groupthink,” Federer told Brat. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Federer asserts that America’s foundational principle of individual rights is rooted in a belief in a Creator, which contrasts with the modern left’s focus on group identity and intersectionality.</p>\n<p>On the program, Federer highlights that the American notion of individual rights derives from the Judeo-Christian understanding that each person is made in the image of God. He explains, “Judeo-Christian faith gave birth to the concept of the individual… your worth is not dependent on the group, but because you’re made in the image of the Creator.” This belief posits that every person holds intrinsic value, regardless of their social or political status. Federer contrasts this with historical and contemporary systems where worth is often linked to one’s position within a group or allegiance to a ruler.</p>\n<p>Federer points out that personal value was tied to one’s relationship with the ruling authority in traditional honor-shame cultures and monarchies. “If you’re worth something to the government or the king, your worth goes up. If you’re not supporting them, your worth goes down. And if you’re their enemy, you’re dead.” This system emphasizes a top-down approach where individual value is contingent on group dynamics and political loyalty.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Federer underscores that America’s founders drew on the pre-King Saul period of the Bible, which emphasized individual accountability to God rather than subservience to a monarch. “The founders of America looked to the pre-King Saul part of the Bible,” he explains. This aspect of biblical history highlights a model where individuals are valued and held accountable directly by God, not by earthly rulers.</p>\n<p>Federer criticizes modern liberalism for abandoning these principles, arguing that contemporary leftist ideologies prioritize group identity over individual worth. He asserts, “Liberals really don’t believe in equality. They believe in intersectionality—that your worth is dependent on what group you belong to and the more minority groups you belong to, your worth goes up.” This approach, Federer argues, undermines the foundational American belief in inherent individual rights, which are seen as granted by a Creator rather than by the state.</p>\n<p>The discussion reveals Federer’s view that without believing in a Creator, individual rights become precarious. He states, “If there is no Creator, then the rights come from the government… if the state gives rights, it can and inevitably will take them away.” This perspective underscores his concern that the erosion of the Creator-based understanding of rights could lead to a system where the state grants and revokes rights.</p>\n<p>Federer’s dialogue with Brat emphasizes a stark contrast between America’s foundational principles of individual rights, derived from a belief in a Creator, and the modern left’s focus on group identity and state-granted rights. He contends that the essence of American liberty and individual value is inseparable from its Judeo-Christian origins, and that abandoning these roots risks undermining the concept of individual rights.</p>\n<p>Federer finished by laying out a call to action for Christians to understand the importance of voting and defending these important foundational issues in the United States.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Will Federer:</p>\n<h1>William J. Federer Walks Through How The God Gives You Value, Not Your Intersectionality Group</h1>\n<p>SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT FROM THE WAR ROOM DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p>In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the political landscape toward expanding government influence in various sectors, often described as the rise of “the Administrative State.”</p>\n<p>This movement, characterized by increased regulation, oversight, and intervention, has profound implications for everyday citizens, affecting everything from healthcare and education to personal freedoms and economic opportunities.</p>\n<p>These are points people should consider when choosing who they will vote for.</p>\n<p>Regulatory Expansion:</p>\n<p>The US Government at various levels have increasingly implemented regulations across numerous industries, impacting how businesses operate and how individuals engage with essential services.\nThe intention is often to ensure safety, protect the environment, and promote fair practices, but the outcome can be burdensome compliance costs for businesses and limited choices for consumers.</p>\n<p>Healthcare:</p>\n<p>The expansion of government in healthcare aims to increase access to medical services, but it often leads to debates over the efficiency and quality of care. Policies like universal healthcare or government-managed systems raise questions about the balance between accessibility and innovation.</p>\n<p>Education:</p>\n<p>Government intervention in education through standardized testing and curriculum guidelines is intended to raise educational standards.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In today’s increasingly interconnected world, Investigative journalist Lara Logan has exposed a shadowy network of radical organizations and groups that has emerged, wielding immense power and influence without the accountability expected in democratic societies.</p>\n<p>Logan reported on Thursday’s WarRoom that these entities operate under the guise of progressive political ideals and charitable missions but harbor a sinister agenda to dominate humanity.</p>\n<p>As journalist Logan pointed out to WarRoom host Dave Brat, these groups form “a global cult” that manipulates political and social dynamics to further their interests.</p>\n<p>Logan described for Brat that the backbone of this shadow government is a network of Affinity groups, loosely connected organizations that share common ideologies and goals. She reported that these groups ranged from Marxist collectives to environmental and animal rights organizations. They function like a spider’s web, extending their reach into various sectors of society, often under the protection of legal bodies like the National Lawyers Guild.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Logan noted, “Anytime you see this kind of language, you know, mutual aid is a Marxist dog whistle,” indicating how seemingly innocuous terms conceal deeper agendas.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>These affinity groups are ideologically driven and financially and strategically supported by influential non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and foundations. Organizations like the Open Society Foundation, the Kellogg Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Tides Foundation are often the financial lifelines for these groups, enabling them to pursue their objectives without facing significant opposition or scrutiny.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Logan explained, “They’re financed by non-governmental organizations. This is how they set up a money laundering operation,” highlighting the opaque financial practices that allow these groups to thrive.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>What makes this shadow government particularly alarming is its global reach. These organizations have offices and operations worldwide, creating a unified front that can influence international policy and societal norms. “These issues are now completely global,” Logan remarked, pointing to the seamless spread of ideologies across borders. Technology and social media play a crucial role in this expansion, allowing for the rapid dissemination of ideas and coordination of activities on a global scale.</p>\n<p>Logan told Brat to imagine if historical figures like Hitler or Marx had access to today’s technology, which Logan ominously highlighted: “If they had had access to billions of people all over the planet for their message, that would have been absolutely devastating.”</p>\n<p>The reality of such technological power is no longer hypothetical; it’s being wielded by these modern-day organizations, shaping narratives and public opinion worldwide.</p>\n<p>The crux of the issue is the lack of accountability. These organizations operate with little to no oversight, effectively bypassing the democratic processes that govern the lives of ordinary citizens. Logan noted, “It’s as fascist as it gets to the core,” referring to the unchecked power and influence these groups wield. This lack of accountability is compounded by the financial backing they receive, which insulates them from public scrutiny and allows them to push their agendas with impunity.</p>\n<p>She said the recent revelations about Black Lives Matter and its international operations further illustrate the point. What began as a domestic movement has now transformed into a global entity, funded and supported by some of the world’s most powerful foundations. “The Tides Foundation was at one point running their International operation,” Logan revealed, underscoring the complex web of support enabling these organizations to operate globally.</p>\n<p>The rise of this secret hand, shadow world government poses a significant threat to democratic societies and the principles of accountability and transparency. As these organizations continue to grow in influence, it becomes imperative for citizens and policymakers alike to demand greater oversight and transparency. The consolidation of power and resources in the hands of a few not only undermines democratic processes but also endangers the very fabric of society.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the existence of a shadow world government comprised of unaccountable organizations and affinity groups is not a mere conspiracy theory but a pressing reality that demands immediate attention.</p>\n<p>As Logan succinctly put it, “This Marxist thing is an attack… a denial of God.” The time has come to unmask these entities and hold them accountable for their actions, ensuring that power remains in the hands of the people and not a select few who operate in the shadows.</p>\n<p>Watch the Thursday WarRoom segment with Lara Logan for more on her investigations:</p>\n<h1>Logan: The UN’s Designating Migration As Human Right Globally With Zero Input From American People</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Thursday on the War Room, Marley Hornik, Executive Director of<a href=\"https://unite4freedom.com/\"> United Sovereign Americans</a>, illuminated the growing concerns around election integrity with a bold declaration: her organization is pursuing several high-stakes lawsuits to rectify systemic voter registration and participation issues.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The importance of these lawsuits cannot be overstated. Hornik explained, \"When a state actually grants access to the Ballot Box equally to an invalid registrant as a demonstrably, proven validated, verified citizen voter, they are committing a count of federal election fraud.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hornik’s revelations, which she shared with WarRoom host Dave Brat, and the subsequent legal actions she described expose the critical need for more transparency and accountability in the electoral process.</p>\n<p>The WarRoom is encouraged to participate with Hornik and her group.</p>\n<p>Hornik presented startling findings from her organization’s investigations on the program. These investigations uncovered 29 million \"facially invalid” voter registrations across 20 states. She described these registrations as \"literally people who are, according to the state registered to vote before they’re born, registered on January 1st from 1900 to 2022, or registered after having cast votes.”</p>\n<p>According to Hornik, these irregularities point to potential election fraud, emphasizing that such issues are not mere clerical errors but severe flaws in the integrity of the voting system.</p>\n<p>The impact of these invalid registrations is profound. Hornik reported that 10 million votes were cast by individuals with questionable registrations in the 2022 midterms alone. She highlighted the gravity of the situation by noting, \"One out of every three votes counted in Franklin County, Ohio, came from a registrant with a state registration date of January 1st.” This example is particularly significant given that the election involved crucial amendments to Ohio’s Constitution, including changes to abortion laws.</p>\n<p>Hornik’s group is actively addressing these concerns through legal action. \"United Sovereign Americans is filing a lawsuit today in federal court in Ohio to match our existing litigation already pending in Maryland and Pennsylvania,” she revealed.</p>\n<p>The lawsuits aim to enforce legal standards and ensure that only eligible, verified voters influence election outcomes. Hornik’s strategy includes targeting states with severe voting integrity issues, with upcoming lawsuits planned for North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Georgia, and Colorado.</p>\n<p>Hornik’s commitment to addressing these issues reflects a broader concern for the health of American democracy. \"This is the most important process we do as a country,” she asserted. \"Everything that all of your guests today have talked about turns at the ballot box, who’s in charge of this country—the elites or the American people.”</p>\n<p>Her focus on legal action to uphold democratic principles highlights the need for vigilance and accountability in the face of potential electoral abuses.</p>\n<p>Hornik urged citizens to support their efforts, emphasizing the need for both financial and participatory contributions. \"We have lawsuits teed up for Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas. And our next targets are Florida, Michigan, Georgia, and Colorado. We need your help,” she said, calling for involvement in safeguarding the democratic process.</p>\n<p>Hornik’s legal battles are a crucial part of the ongoing fight for election integrity. Her efforts represent a concerted push to ensure that the electoral system remains fair, transparent, and representative of the American electorate.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit her website and watch the entire segment with Marley Hornik:</p>\n<h1>Marly Hornik Exposes 10 Million Votes Illegally Cast In 2022 Midterms</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In case you needed more proof the 2020 Election was stolen, Merrick Garland just announced that they’re going to try to kill President Trump again.</p>\n<p>The regime is so terrified of President Trump and the Make America Great Again movement beating them for a third time that they’ve orchestrated efforts to smear him, bankrupt him, imprison him, and when all else has failed, kill him.</p>\n<p>Garland recently took to NBC News, and deep state lackey Ken Dilanian, to announce he is very worried Iran will try to kill President Trump.</p>\n<p>\"<span>Our intelligence community has made clear that we believe </span>that the Iranians are attempting to kill or injure former high government officials,” Garland said. \"This is an ongoing issue, we have ongoing investigations.”</p>\n<p><span>\"You don’t think we’ve seen the end?” </span>Dilanian prompted.</p>\n<p>\"<span>I don’t think we’ve seen the end</span> of Iranian plotting, no.”</p>\n<p>Emphasis added. Like everything else in our politics, the only things that happen are what the intelligence community \"makes clear” to their hatchet men. The intelligence community tells them what they believe, regardless if it’s true, and it hardly ever is. Iran is plotting to kill Trump just like Russia is \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-interfering-2024-election-help-trump-us-intelligence-officials-say\"><span>interfering</span></a>” in the election. Another red herring trotted out via the Fake News media to divert attention from their own evil deeds. They are setting up the blame for the next attack on President Trump, and shifting it away from themselves.</p>\n<p>It was not Iran who let eight shots be fired at    President Trump, hitting him in the ear, killing Corey Comperatore, and injuring two others. It was our own government that let that happen.</p>\n<p>So why would Garland have a problem with plots against President Trump, anyway? His and the regime’s entire job has been plots against Trump for the past <span>nine years</span>.</p>\n<p>He heads the same (In)Justice Department that, in concert with the \"intelligence community,” illegally spied on him, tried to frame him for \"collusion” with Russia, covered up the Lap Top From Hell, covered up how the election was stolen from him, <a href=\"https://revolver.news/2024/01/secret-service-foreknowledge-or-criminal-negligence-damning-new-evidence-surfaces-fbi-january-6-pipe-bomb-story/\"><span>set up</span></a> January 6th to arrest him and his supporters as \"domestic terrorists,” illegally raided his home, and indicted him 91 times on fake charges in the hopes of seeing him die in prison. But now, after the failed assasination attempt, Garland is suddenly worried about President Trump’s wellbeing. Doth protest too much.</p>\n<p>So for anyone still clinging to politics as usual, where they feign outrage at cat lady jokes or pass around the \"<a href=\"https://x.com/virtuemediacorp/status/1818248792187031556?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>weird</span></a>” talking points, it’s time to get serious. By the grace of God, President Trump, and America, is still here. But the world doesn’t want it that way. <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%207:14&amp;version=KJV\"><span>Pray</span></a> for our country.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Thursday’s War Room, Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Polling unveiled a detailed analysis of the current polling landscape, specifically focusing on a hypothetical presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.</p>\n<p>The key takeaway from Mitchell’s presentation was that Trump is maintaining a steady lead over Harris despite a brief surge for the Vice President following Barack Obama’s recent endorsement.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Mitchell reported, “Donald Trump is still beating Kamala Harris by five points in a two-way matchup.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He noted that this data is based on six polling days and reflects a broader trend rather than short-term fluctuations. Mitchell criticized early polls showing Harris with an advantage, suggesting they were skewed by media bias and incomplete data.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people rush to put polls out… and I think there’s reasons that you could look at those polls internals and say, that’s really not what’s happening,” he argued.</p>\n<p>The so-called “Obama bounce,” a spike in Harris’s popularity following the endorsement, has since dissipated. Mitchell highlighted this with the observation, “Trump has steadily clawed that lead back, and he’s up four points on the 30th, five points on the 31st.” Mitchell told host Dave Brat that this rebound illustrates Trump’s resilience amid a barrage of media scrutiny and attacks.</p>\n<p>Mitchell critically analyzed the demographics, noting that while Trump is gaining among men and independents, his support among women and younger voters remains more volatile. “He’s losing a little more with 18 to 39-year-olds… but he was tied in the two-way matchup,” Mitchell explained.</p>\n<p>This variability suggests that while Trump’s overall position is strong, certain voter groups may still be influenced by ongoing events and media narratives.</p>\n<p>The pollster also discussed the broader electoral landscape, indicating that Trump’s lead is “comfortably outside the margin of error” and in line with other reputable polls. “The race is looking more like a two-way matchup,” Mitchell said, implying that despite some fluctuations, Trump’s overall advantage remains significant.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s data also underscored the limitations of multi-way matchups versus two-way races. He observed that in multi-way polls, Trump’s lead narrows to about 1.5 points, compared to a more consistent five-point lead in two-way scenarios. This discrepancy suggests that support for third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is minimal, impacting the overall dynamics of the race.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s analysis paints a picture of a resilient Trump maintaining a solid lead over Harris despite the temporary boost from high-profile endorsements and media coverage.</p>\n<p>The data he collected reflects a stable trend in favor of Trump, even as the race evolves with changing voter sentiments and external influences.</p>\n<p>As Mitchell concluded, “Donald Trump is settling into a 49-50 point range,” indicating a strong and consistent lead in the face of ongoing challenges.</p>\n<p>For fuller context, watch the full segment featuring Mark Mitchell:</p>\n<h1>Pollster Mark Mitchell Reveals Kamala’s Honeymoon Phase Already Fading</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Kamala Harris’s role in the Biden administration’s immigration policy has recently come under intense scrutiny as her office spearheads an ambitious and controversial amnesty initiative. This new push, revealed on Thursday’s WarRoom program by Rosemary Jenks of the Immigration Accountability Project, exposes a dangerous shift in strategy by the Democrats, aiming to bypass Congress in favor of unilateral action on immigration.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Jenks describes this move as an unprecedented reward for illegal behavior, asserting, \"The longer you have successfully broken our laws, the more you’re going to be rewarded for it.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jenks told show host Dave Brat that starting August 19th, the Biden administration plans to accept applications for amnesty from illegal aliens who have been in the U.S. for over ten years and are married to U.S. citizens. She said the policy will also extend to those who have graduated from U.S. colleges.</p>\n<p>This initiative mirrors the controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program implemented by the Obama administration in 2012, which was also criticized for its executive overreach.</p>\n<p>The details surrounding the new amnesty program remain sparse, with critical questions about eligibility and the scope of criminal offenses that might be overlooked. Jenks questions whether the administration will disregard illegal voting or false claims of U.S. citizenship as part of the amnesty criteria.</p>\n<p>\"We don’t know what criminal offenses they’re going to waive,” she warns. This lack of transparency has fueled concerns that the new amnesty program could undermine the rule of law and further complicate immigration enforcement.</p>\n<p>Adding to the complexity is a bipartisan coalition that includes both Democrats and Republicans, notably led by Democrat Tom Suozzi and Republican Morgan Luttrell.</p>\n<p>Jenks expresses her dismay at this collaboration with the ultra-left National Immigration Forum, a group she believes is pushing for policies that are out of step with mainstream American values. \"It is astonishing that Republican members of Congress would join forces with these left-wing groups to promote bad immigration policy,” Jenks says, highlighting a troubling alignment that could erode conservative resistance to expansive amnesty measures.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration’s amnesty gambit is part of a broader pattern of executive actions aimed at circumventing legislative gridlock. The administration’s efforts to enact significant immigration reforms through executive orders rather than traditional legislative channels reflect a strategic decision to push forward with policy changes despite the likelihood of congressional opposition.</p>\n<p>Jenks’s critique of the administration is grounded in broader concerns about the dangers of such unilateral actions. She points to a grim reality: \"Over five and a half million illegal aliens have been released into the U.S., and we have at least 362 people on the terrorist watch list who have tried to enter the country illegally.” These figures illustrate the stakes involved and the potential for increased security risks and societal strain if amnesty measures are not carefully managed.</p>\n<p>In response to these developments, Jenks calls for heightened vigilance and action from the public. She urges supporters to visit the <a href=\"https://iaproject.org/\">Immigration Accountability Project</a>’s website for more information and to mobilize against what she sees as a dangerous expansion of amnesty policies. \"The destruction to this country is enormous,” Jenks asserts, framing the fight against these policies as crucial for preserving national integrity and security.</p>\n<p>As the Biden administration’s amnesty initiatives unfold, the debate over immigration reform remains charged with high stakes and deep divisions.</p>\n<p>Harris’s role in advancing these policies and the responses from various political actors will likely continue to shape the national discourse on immigration in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire WarRoom segment featuring Rosemary Jenks:</p>\n<h1>Jenks Exposes How The Biden-Harris Administration’s Circumventing Congress To Grant MASS Amnesty</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On a recent episode of the WarRoom, U.S. Rep. Chip Roy and Rep. Eli Crane discussed the changing dynamics in Washington, D.C., focusing on JD Vance’s approach to governance and the growing public mistrust in government institutions.</p>\n<p>Crane recently secured a significant primary victory and shared his strategy of prioritizing his constituents’ needs over party lines, even at the risk of conflicting with leadership.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I know that a lot of freshmen come in believing, ‘Well, you know, if I just, you know, if I just fall in line and do what I’m told and climb the ranks and become a subcommittee chairman and then a chairman and then I become part of a leadership, sooner or later, I’ll get to the point where I have enough power and authority to actually, you know, do the right things. But I gotta play the game a little bit first.’ But I came in with the complete opposite approach. And that was that I’m going to actually represent my voters on day one, which put me in a lot of hot water in opposition to leadership on day one,” Crane told Roy. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He highlighted that his approach has been validated by strong support from his district, emphasizing that staying true to one’s promises can lead to significant electoral success.</p>\n<p>Crane expressed strong support for Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance, who has faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans. He praised Vance for his authenticity and commitment to addressing the concerns of average Americans. “JD Vance is someone who understands what time it is in America,” Crane said, commending Vance’s ability to connect with people from various backgrounds and his focus on meaningful reform.</p>\n<p>\"Whether JD goes to a truck stop in Kentucky or a cocktail party in San Francisco, this guy can touch base and communicate with Americans and identify with them. I think that’s hard to do, and I’ve known some really strong politicians who have a tough time identifying with people. I think JD does a great job of that,” Roy said, in agreement.</p>\n<p>The conversation also addressed the public’s increasing distrust in government institutions. Crane noted that many Americans feel let down by the government’s handling of important issues, suggesting that this skepticism stems from a broader sense of betrayal by politicians who fail to deliver on their promises. “The American people don’t trust the federal government to get to the bottom of this,” Crane remarked, referring to ongoing frustrations with governmental transparency and effectiveness.</p>\n<p>\"JD is one of the few Senators who actually comes to break bread with us and discuss how we can fight against the uniparty in DC. He regularly meets with the Freedom Caucus to work on strategies and ensure we have a plan to deliver on the promises made to the American people,” Crane said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Crane criticized the composition of a recent task force to look into the assassination attempt on President Trump, expressing disappointment that it did not include individuals with relevant expertise, such as snipers. He argued that this oversight reflects a wider problem of governmental inefficiency and a lack of effective problem-solving. Crane’s comments highlighted a belief that the current political system often fails to address critical issues adequately.</p>\n<p>Crane’s emphasis on staying true to constituents and his critique of governmental handling of key issues underscore a broader concern about the effectiveness and transparency of current political processes.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full Wednesday segment featuring Eli Crane:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Wednesday, Congressman Chip Roy spoke with Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote, to address the wave of criticism aimed at her organization, particularly from major media outlets like CNN. True the Vote is being accused of voter suppression tactics, but Engelbrecht insists that the group’s mission is to protect election integrity by ensuring only eligible citizens vote.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>She explains, “True the Vote is dedicated to protecting the integrity of our elections and ensuring that only eligible citizens can vote.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As she discussed with Roy after viewing a CNN hit piece in the show’s cold open footage, Engelbrecht is under fire for True the Vote’s initiatives, which aim to empower citizens to evaluate local voter rolls and identify potentially ineligible voter registrations. Critics have characterized these initiatives as attempts to suppress voters, a claim she firmly denies.</p>\n<p>“This is just the attack du jour,” Engelbrecht remarked, referring to the latest CNN report. She described how CNN is conducting open records requests to obtain the names of volunteers involved in True the Vote’s efforts, which is allegedly leading to harassment. “CNN has taken it upon itself to file open records requests for everywhere they think citizens… will be involved.</p>\n<p>They’re filing those open records requests with the counties, getting the names of the people involved, and then harassing them, showing up on their doorstep. It’s outrageous,” she stated.</p>\n<p>The discussion highlighted True the Vote’s focus on projects like the <a href=\"https://www.iv3.us/\">IV3</a> initiative, which aims to clean up voter rolls by identifying potentially fraudulent or ineligible registrations. Engelbrecht claims the project has successfully flagged over 825,000 potentially ineligible records. These are often people who have moved, registered in multiple states, or are registered at commercial addresses rather than residential ones.</p>\n<p>“Our voter rolls are a mess,” Engelbrecht insisted, emphasizing the need for accurate and reliable voter data.</p>\n<p>Roy, who sympathizes with Engelbrecht’s challenges, pointed out the broader political climate’s hostility toward election integrity efforts. “I get it in Congress all the time… We understand what the radical progressive Democratic machine is doing,” he noted, reflecting on the broader discourse surrounding election fraud and integrity.</p>\n<p>He pointed to jurisdictions like Washington, D.C., where non-citizens have been reportedly encouraged to register for local elections, describing this as part of a broader strategy to undermine U.S. election systems. “We literally had a program in DC, and we had a vote to stop that in the House. And it passed with significant Democrat support, by the way,” Roy added, stressing bipartisan recognition of the issue.</p>\n<p>Engelbrecht further defended True the Vote’s use of the IV3 app, designed to aid citizens in evaluating voter registrations within their communities. “In Texas, you have to find personal belief of the facts that are available that support the submission of a challenge,” she explained. The process involves citizens presenting potentially ineligible voter records to county officials, who then determine their validity. Engelbrecht argued that CNN’s portrayal overlooks the role counties play in verifying these challenges, focusing instead on True the Vote’s involvement. “It is ultimately the county that is making the determinations,” she clarified.</p>\n<p>In response to CNN’s allegations, Engelbrecht challenged the idea that her organization aims to disenfranchise voters. Instead, she portrayed True the Vote as a necessary force in a landscape of outdated and inaccurate voter rolls. “We live in the age of Amazon. One click, where our data is known to the nth degree, how could it be that our voter rolls, which should be the bedrock of a representative republic, how could it be that they are so inaccurate?” she asked, highlighting the need for technological advancements in voter registration systems.</p>\n<p>Engelbrecht concluded the conversation by urging citizens to get involved and stay informed about their local voter rolls. She believes that empowering citizens to act is crucial for maintaining a fair and transparent electoral process.</p>\n<p>“Don’t just listen to what I’m telling you, look at it for yourselves and judge for yourselves if the problems you’re facing in the county are things that you want to bring to the attention of your elected representatives,” she advised. For Engelbrecht and True the Vote, the mission is clear: safeguarding the integrity of American elections is a responsibility that falls on every citizen.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full True the Vote -WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Protect Your OWN Local Elections</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Tuesday WarRoom discussion, Paul Dans addressed the wave of misinformation surrounding Project 2025, a comprehensive policy initiative aimed at reforming the U.S. executive branch. Dans, who serves as the director of the project, took to defending the initiative against criticisms that it neglects key issues, such as Supreme Court reforms.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"To be clear, this is not Donald Trump’s Project 2025. This was stood up years ago in 2022, as really a coming together of the conservative movement. We brought over 110 groups together. And, and this is what also rankles the left. Is that there’s a unified group of conservatives on the right that were not, you know, in our constant sibling rivalry constantly but we’ve come together on important areas and really outline that the threat that we don’t accomplish what we need to do is really the architecture of this progressive government that’s been built up.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Dans emphasizes that Project 2025 is not solely Trump’s initiative but a collaborative effort by the conservative movement, formed before Trump’s current campaign and aimed at reforming the federal government.</p>\n<p>Dans explained that Project 2025 is not an exhaustive blueprint for overhauling every aspect of government but rather a focused effort to reinvigorate the executive branch. The project’s critics, including those from MSNBC and other media outlets, have pointed to its lack of detailed proposals for the Supreme Court as evidence of its shortcomings. Dans pushed back against these claims, highlighting that such critiques often stem from misinformation and a misunderstanding of the project’s scope and objectives.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Dans responded to the critics by noting, “The project like Mark had said is really an approach to the executive branch… We have to start with the executive branch where the president really is the sole repository of the executive power.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He emphasized that Project 2025 is designed to address the executive branch’s inefficiencies and ensure it better reflects the will of the people. By focusing on this area, the project aims to restore executive power to its proper place, counteracting what Dans describes as a “permanent government” that operates outside the influence of ordinary citizens.</p>\n<p>Critics have accused Project 2025 of many things, one of which is that it was not interested in the status of the US Supreme Court. Dans argued that this critique is part of a larger misinformation campaign against the project. He pointed out that the absence of detailed proposals from the Supreme Court does not imply that the project is incomplete or flawed. Instead, it reflects a strategic decision to prioritize the executive branch, which Dans believes is crucial for effecting meaningful change.</p>\n<p>He elaborated, “What you’re seeing from the left is not an assault on Project 2025. It’s really projection. Project 2025 is calling out the deep state and the progressive government that’s been built up.”</p>\n<p>Dans portrayed the criticisms as a deliberate effort to distract from the project’s substantive goals and its impact on government reform. According to Dans, the left’s pushback indicates the project’s significance and threat to the status quo.</p>\n<p>Project 2025’s approach, according to Dans, is akin to what think tanks across the political spectrum do—develop policy proposals and strategic recommendations to guide future administrations. He stressed that this is a standard practice among think tanks, whether on the left or right. Dans asserted, “This was stood up years ago in 2022… It was really a coming together of the conservative movement. We brought over 110 groups together.” This collaborative effort aims to provide a comprehensive framework for conservative governance, much like how left-leaning think tanks produce detailed policy proposals.</p>\n<p>Dans’s defense of Project 2025 highlights a broader point about the role of think tanks in shaping political discourse. These organizations often become targets of misinformation and misrepresentation, particularly when their proposals challenge entrenched interests or propose significant reforms. In this context, Project 2025’s focus on revitalizing the executive branch should be seen as a strategic initiative rather than a comprehensive blueprint for all aspects of governance.</p>\n<p>Dans’s response to Project 2025’s critics underscores the importance of understanding the project’s scope and goals. By focusing on the executive branch, Project 2025 aims to address critical issues within it and counteract what Dans views as a progressive deep state.</p>\n<p>Dans argues that the criticism it faces reflects its potential impact and the threat it poses to the current political establishment.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the whole segment featuring Paul Dans:</p>\n<h1>The Disinformation Campaign Against Project 2025</h1>\n</div>\n"

WarRoom guest Gina Swoboda provided a detailed account of the voting situation on Teusday and highlighted some technical challenges she was aware of.</p>\n<p>Swoboda told show host Ben Harnwell that as of the latest update, Maricopa County saw nearly 5,000 Republicans, 1,200 independents, and 1,000 Democrats cast their votes in person. Swoboda noted that this high turnout was expected, reflecting strong engagement from various voter groups. Despite this, she explained that the day has not been without its issues.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We had a few tabulators down and some problems with the printer on demand,” Swoboda reported.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>These technical problems have been a cause for concern, but she praised the county’s efforts to address them. “Maricopa County elections is keeping calm and working with me to resolve issues swiftly,” she added.</p>\n<p>Swoboda emphasized the importance of voters remaining vigilant if they encounter problems at polling locations. Specifically, she advised, “If you check in and they’re not letting you check out, stay on site until the equipment is fixed.” This is crucial because leaving a polling place without checking out could lead to having to vote provisionally, which might complicate the vote counting process. She highlighted that, in some instances, “the clerks at the desk didn’t know how to check voters out,” which has exacerbated the issue.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Swoboda is focused on ensuring that these technical problems are resolved before the general election. She reassured voters that they are working to improve the situation. “We’re already in talks with Maricopa County to enhance training and prevent these issues in the future,” she said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Swoboda mentioned the potential impact of these issues on the Attorney General race, suggesting that provisional ballots might affect the outcomes. She is committed to staying on top of the situation, stating, “I will only update on social media if there is a catastrophic alert.”</p>\n<p>Swoboda concluded by encouraging voters to stay informed and proactive. “If you encounter problems, do not leave the polling station without checking out,” she urged. This approach is crucial in ensuring that every vote is counted accurately and the integrity of the election process is maintained.</p>\n<p>Swoboda and her team monitor the situation closely as the day progresses, aiming to address any further challenges that may arise and ensure a smooth electoral process.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Gina Swoboda:</p>\n<h1>Gina Swoboda Explains How To Secure YOUR Vote In Arizona And Effort To Safeguard Our Elections</h1>\n</div>\n"

I can feel the energy shifting and a sense of unity,” she observed. The event was more than just a gathering of Bitcoin enthusiasts; it was a convergence of ideas about freedom, innovation, and resistance to centralized control.</p>\n<p>One of Kinsey’s most striking observations was the unexpected emphasis on faith and spirituality at the Bitcoin conference. Despite the event’s focus on cryptocurrency, discussions frequently turned to God and the moral implications of financial freedom. “I have never heard God be brought up in so many conversations,” Kinsey remarked, adding that this was particularly significant given her perspective as a young person navigating a secular culture.</p>\n<p>Kinsey and Posobiec agreed that this spiritual dimension represents a more profound shift among young people today.</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin Conference likely shows a growing trend among young people increasingly seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems and political structures. By embracing Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies, they appear to advocate for a future where individuals have more control over their economic destinies and a more significant say in shaping the world around them, which is the foundation of the America First movement.</p>\n<p>Kinsey’s observations at the conference add to an understanding of a dynamic shift in how young people view the relationship between faith, freedom, and financial empowerment. As the Bitcoin movement continues to gain momentum, her remarks serve as a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of liberty and the timeless pursuit of a more just and equitable society.</p>\n<p>This burgeoning alliance between cryptocurrency and conservative values offers a unique glimpse into how the next generation of leaders might redefine the landscape of American politics and finance.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire WarRoom segment featuring Camryn Kinsey.</p>\n<h1>Camryn Kinsey: The Bitcoin Community Has Largely Supported Trump Due To His Anti-Establishment Views</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Reports appeared on the WarRoom on Saturday with Jack Posobiec. The two discussed the shifting dynamics of the political landscape, focusing on recent polling data and its implications for the upcoming 2024 election. Rasmussen Reports, known for its accuracy in predicting previous elections, plays a significant role in understanding public sentiment, especially amidst the rapid changes in news cycles.</p>\n<p>Corporate media has labeled Rasmussen Reports a “far-right pollster,” yet its track record speaks volumes.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We nailed 2016, we nailed 2020,” Mitchell asserted, pointing out that other reputable pollsters like CNN, Bloomberg, and Harvard Harris align with their findings. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This history of accurate predictions lends credibility to Rasmussen’s current analysis and forecasts for the 2024 election.</p>\n<p>Mitchell, on Saturday, confidently predicted that Trump would remain a formidable force heading into the 2024 election, especially among independents. “Trump’s numbers are just solidly pretty close to 50,” Mitchell noted, emphasizing the stability of Trump’s support. He pointed out that Trump’s lead remains resilient even with potential shifts in voter sentiment due to media narratives.</p>\n<p>Mitchell started the conversation by addressing how the fast-paced media environment impacts public opinion. \"It’s really hard to poll on what topic Americans care about most when things are changing this fast,” Mitchell observed. He noted that while the media quickly moves from one story to another, certain events still leave a lasting impression. For instance, the assassination attempt on a key figure, which occurred just days before the Republican National Convention (RNC), contributed to a noticeable shift in polling data.</p>\n<p>Mitchell highlighted a significant post-RNC bounce for Trump, which saw his lead over Biden increase from three to eight points. He explained that this bounce could partially be attributed to the assassination attempt, as it drew considerable attention and possibly influenced voter sentiment. “A lot of it could have been the assassination attempt as well,” Mitchell speculated. This observation underscores the complexity of polling in an era where unexpected events can quickly alter public perceptions.</p>\n<p>The conversation also got into the media’s portrayal of Kamala Harris and its influence on public opinion. Mitchell pointed out that the media has been attempting to elevate Harris as a formidable candidate, dubbing her as a “female Obama.” However, he argued that this portrayal is misleading. “The media is trying to prop this woman up… but there’s just no way that this woman is beating Donald Trump,” he stated. According to Rasmussen’s polling data, Trump consistently outperforms Harris, with a national lead that stands solidly outside the margin of error.</p>\n<p>Mitchell further explained that the so-called “Harris momentum” is more about Democrats rallying around her in Biden’s absence rather than a genuine swing in her favor. Posobiec likened this media hype to promoting “terrible new Disney Star Wars movies” that receive poor audience scores. “The hype that we’re seeing for Kamala Harris right now, is exactly like the hype for one of these terrible new Disney Star Wars movies, right?” Posobiec remarked, emphasizing the discrepancy between media narratives and public opinion.</p>\n<p>Rasmussen Reports’ history of accuracy, coupled with Mitchell’s insights into the current political landscape, suggests that while media hype may temporarily sway public perception, the underlying support for Trump remains strong.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Rasmussen Polls | Trump Up +1 to +9 In Every Swing State, Trump Is Winning With Independents</h1>\n</div>\n"

Corey Mills and journalist Benny Johnson, they visited the site to conduct an independent review of the security measures, driven by a lack of trust in federal authorities to disclose the deadly details fully.</p>\n<p>“This is my second time this week going to Butler, PA, to do an investigation,” Crane explained. “Most of us don’t trust the federal government to get to the bottom of this, and I think even fewer of us trust that they would actually relay it to the American people.”</p>\n<p>Crane’s attitude about the government likely reflects a growing disillusionment among Americans who believe that federal agencies may not be transparent about their findings.</p>\n<p>Crane highlighted his concern about security arrangements during the rally. “I don’t know who made the call for that rally to be held at that site in the first place. There were just way too many threats,” he said. The location’s inadequate security, particularly the absence of a full presidential protection package for Trump, was one of Crane’s primary criticisms.</p>\n<p>“There were just way too many threats,” Crane asserted, pointing to the site’s high-risk nature for someone as high-profile as Trump, who he described as “one of the most loved but also one of the most hated men on planet Earth.”</p>\n<p>One of the key revelations from the investigation was the failure to utilize available vantage points for counter-sniper teams, specifically the water tower near the venue. “I’ve been sounding the alarm on this that none of the counter-sniper teams got up in the water tower,” Crane said. This oversight raised significant questions about the planning and execution of security operations during the event.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on “sheepdogs” within government and law enforcement, individuals who share the public’s skepticism about the federal narrative. According to Crane, this group of insiders plays a crucial role in ensuring accountability and transparency, as they are willing to challenge official accounts when necessary.</p>\n<p>During the segment, Crane also pointed out specific incidents that highlighted the lack of coordination during the event, including reports of security personnel leaving their posts and difficulties accessing secure areas due to key card malfunctions. “I’m also hearing that one of the individuals went outside to find the shooter, and then his key card wasn’t working to get back into the building,” Crane noted, illustrating the chaotic nature of the security operations.</p>\n<p>Crane expressed hope that a committee led by Speaker Johnson would investigate these lapses, emphasizing the need for members willing to pursue the truth. “I just wanted to put people on there that aren’t technically punchers, who are willing to actually be bold and courageous when they believe it might cost them,” he stated, recommending individuals like Clay Higgins for their experience and commitment to uncovering the truth.</p>\n<p>Crane stressed the importance of independent oversight in government operations. By highlighting the role of “sheepdogs” and calling for more transparency, Crane and the WarRoom ensure that the American people are informed about the true nature of security challenges faced by public figures and events.</p>\n<p>Benny Johnson has published a good part of their investigation:</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Eli Crane:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Friday, Ben Harnwell and Caroline Wren raised significant concerns about the ActBlue platform, highlighting its potential for massive financial misconduct and calling for immediate investigations into the alleged corruption. This discussion, which has gained traction online, scrutinizes the operations of ActBlue, a significant fundraising platform used by the Democratic Party. Wren offered a call to action to the WarRoom audience to start investigations at the grassroots level:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"There is actually a website, that’s really incredible called <a href=\"https://electionwatch.info/\">ElectionWatch.info</a>, where you can go and search, you know, some of the top ones that they’re flagging as this does not seem real. You can search by your state, your neighborhood and go and look, and if you see, like, a neighbor of yours and that in thinking, hey, that person, uh, would never make that type of donation. Politely, kind of ask them, say, did you know that you gave this number of donations?” Wren told Harnwell.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Wren began her report by explaining the context of the controversy saying, “Earlier this week, the Kamala Harris campaign reported over $100 million in donations via ActBlue within just 36 hours after Biden’s departure from the race,” she said.</p>\n<p>Notably, she pointed out that 60 percent of these donations came from first-time Democratic donors. This, Wren argued, seemed unusually high and raised suspicions about the legitimacy of the reported figures.</p>\n<p>Wren criticized ActBlue’s practices, suggesting that the platform might be involved in a substantial money laundering scheme. She detailed several red flags: \"We’ve seen numerous reports of ActBlue processing donations through what some are calling ghost accounts or Smurfs, allegedly laundering hundreds of millions of dollars.” These transactions often involve small amounts—like 40 cents or a dollar—that, when accumulated, lead to significant sums of money.</p>\n<p>She expressed frustration with the lack of action from federal authorities. \"It’s very frustrating that the DOJ isn’t investigating this, and where are the Republican AGs? They should be opening investigations into ActBlue’s operations in their states,” Wren asserted. She emphasized the need for accountability and transparency, suggesting that investigations by state AGs could be a starting point.</p>\n<p>Wren cited an example from a Carolina Journal report to illustrate her point. \"A report from 2023 showed an elderly man on a fixed income who, according to records, had made 1,900 transactions through ActBlue. He claimed to have only made two donations in his life,” she said. This discrepancy, she argued, underscores the platform’s questionable practices.</p>\n<p>She also criticized changes in ActBlue’s credit card processing methods, noting that they had removed security features like the CVV code, which she believes adds to the platform’s dubious nature. Wren argued that these practices contribute to the suspicion of widespread financial misconduct. \"It’s just sketchy,” she said, \"and it raises concerns about a massive money laundering operation.”</p>\n<p>Wren warned of the broader implications of this potential corruption. \"If this money is being laundered from foreign entities, including China, Ukraine, and Russia, it poses a severe threat to the integrity of our elections,” she said. She cited James O’Keefe’s recent lawsuit alleging that over 60 percent of the laundered money comes from China, underscoring the severity of the issue.</p>\n<p>While Wren remained skeptical about the DOJ’s willingness to tackle the issue, she called for grassroots action and vigilance. \"The most significant outcome could be stopping this pipeline of money. We need citizen journalists and ordinary people to investigate and expose these practices,” she urged. She recommended using resources like ElectionWatch.info to track suspicious donations and advocate for transparency.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch Friday’s segment with Caroline Wren:</p>\n<h1>Caroline Wren Warns Of ActBlue’s Possible “Ghost Accounts” Used To Laundering Hundreds Of Millions</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Friday discussion on the WarRoom with Ben Harnwell and Brian Kennedy, Kennedy shared his insights and concerns about the integrity of upcoming elections, focusing on the pervasive fear of electoral fraud. The conversation centered around a recent Rasmussen Reports poll that revealed 65% of Americans are worried that cheating will affect the outcome of the 2024 election. This statistic set the stage for Kennedy to express his strong opinions on past elections and the path forward.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Look the other side’s not 10 feet tall. They don’t have an absolute power to steal every single election. We can outwork them and make the election very close and decided for President Trump,” Kennedy told Harnwell. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kennedy began by stating, “I’m not surprised at all. The American people saw in 2020 there were these gross anomalies. At best, at worst, the election was stolen.” He reiterated his belief that the 2020 election was manipulated and asserted that similar efforts were made in 2022. Looking ahead to 2024, Kennedy expressed his skepticism about the likelihood of a fair election. However, he remained optimistic about overcoming these challenges, emphasizing the importance of active civic engagement.</p>\n<p>“The job for us today is whether we can overcome that,” Kennedy said, urging citizens to take action. He highlighted the role of grassroots efforts and voter mobilization: “It’s not about sitting in just watching the War Room. It’s going to be about in the next coming months, doing more than that.” He stressed the need for people to engage deeply in politics, visiting websites like Protect the Vote and supporting initiatives that promote election integrity.</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s message was clear: despite concerns about electoral fraud, citizens must turn out in large numbers and vote, expressing his support for Trump as the candidate who can challenge what he perceives as a “Communist Revolution.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s remarks also touched on the media’s role in shaping public perception. He compared the modern media to the Soviet Pravda, asserting, “Nearly everything you were hearing from the mainstream media is a lie. Trust none of it, trust only your common sense.” This skepticism toward mainstream narratives was echoed in his advice for voters to rely on their judgment and not be swayed by what he sees as biased reporting.</p>\n<p>The conversation also briefly touched on other political figures, with Kennedy defending J.D. Vance against criticisms and highlighting his focus on family values. “He represents a devotion to his family. First and foremost, he thinks the American family needs to be strengthened at every turn,” Kennedy said, contrasting this with what he views as the American left’s radicalism.</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s message to the audience was one of vigilance and action. Despite acknowledging the potential for election fraud, he called for increased voter participation to counteract these issues. His call to action was clear: “We’re going to have to outwork the other side. We’re going to have to do everything in our power to get our neighbors, friends, and family voting for the candidate of their choice.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s advice about the importance of civic engagement in preserving the democratic process, even amidst concerns about its integrity, is very much needed today.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Brian Kennedy:</p>\n<h1>Brian Kennedy: “The Diminishing Likelihood Of A Fair Election”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>A new analysis of nearly 4,000 duplicates counted in Fulton County, Georgia reveals they were deliberately and fraudulently added into the 2020 Election results.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/0jtptuq49jtnd20m18kuj0rn2lm5r9hm\"><span>report</span></a>, released Monday by software developer Phillip Davis, found a total of 11,873 duplicates, missing, or new ballots differing from the two machine counts, more than the entire election margin alone.</p>\n<p>The 3,930 duplicates in Fulton, increased from the 3,125 originally discovered in the Kevin Moncla and Joseph Rossi complaint, have a distinct pattern showing they were not included in the results by accident.</p>\n<p>\nDavis gave expert analysis earlier this month at the Georgia State Election Board meeting, when Moncla and Rossi were finally given an opportunity to rebut <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>the false claims</span></a> made by the Secretary of State’s office, which tried to dismiss their complaint regarding over 20,000 unsubstantiated ballots in the certified results. Davis alluded to the pattern of the duplicate ballots, which he now released to the public.</p>\n<p>\"382 Absentee Ballots from Tabulator 791 were scrambled together to create double counted ballots in Tabulator 794,” Davis explains. To accomplish this, ballots were placed into the scanner upside down to reverse their order. This pattern, where ballots that were already scanned were taken to create new batches and turned upside down to reverse their order, repeats over and over. All of the duplicate ballots were counted, contrary to Secretary of State general counsel Charlene McGowan’s false claim it was \"inconclusive.”</p>\n<p>Moncla and Rossi say this verified evidence the duplicate scanning was intentional.</p>\n<p>\"The basis for this ‘shuffling’ was to conceal the fact that ballots were being scanned twice,” Moncla and Rossi wrote in a 69-page <span>supplemental factual response</span> submitted to the State Election Board and members of the state legislature on July 22. \"The creation of new batches of ballots from many different batches was an effort to conceal their unlawful actions.”</p>\n<p>\"Let us be very clear, the results for the Fulton County General Election Recount were intentionally manipulated by a fraudulent and unlawful process designed to avoid detection and conceal the unlawful acts,” they wrote. \"The duplicates at issue were not the result of mistake or honest human error, but intentional, bonafide election fraud.”</p>\n<p>Moncla and Rossi’s factual response refutes five major false claims made by the state and Fulton County during the May 7 Board hearing attempting to sweep their complaint under the rug. [Read the full response here <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KM-Ammended_Factual_Response.pdf\">KM-Ammended_Factual_Response</a>.]</p>\n<p>The majority of the duplicates, 2,015, came from tabulator 816, the same tabulator McGowan’s investigators blamed for why Fulton County was over 17,000 votes short during the recount. While 816 was <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>not the reason</span></a> for the shortfall, its results were manipulated. Hundreds of in-person votes were rescanned upside down to create duplicates on the same machine.</p>\n<p>Ballots from tabulator 805 were also duplicated and inserted into tabulator 816’s results. Ballot images from 805 and 816 were both deleted. In fact, tabulator 816 accounts for nearly half of the 17,852 missing ballot images from the second machine count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Secretary of State’s office and Fulton County claim they were able to obtain 518,960 ballot images from the recount, still short of the 527,925 certified total, cited as \"Exhibit 11” in their investigative report. However, this exhibit has been hidden from the public and from the State Election Board.</p>\n<p>McGowan is <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1816456290329080273?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>holding the evidence hostage</span></a>, and will only allow Board members to see the ballot images if they promise to stop investigating SEB-2023-025, the Moncla/Rossi complaint. Dr. Janice Johnston has sought access to the ballot images — the basis for which the state has attempted to close the case — but has yet to obtain them.</p>\n<p>\"[W]e can make the files available for inspection, as long as the Board is in agreement that this case is fully resolved and closed,” McGowan wrote in an email to Johnston on May 14.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can only see the evidence for why they are closing the case if the case is closed. The Secretary of State office is treating their investigation just like its elections: accept their verdict without allowing anyone to see the actual results.</p>\n<p>The investigation is not fully closed, and there is an opportunity for the Board to vote to conduct further research into the case at the upcoming Aug. 7 meeting.</p>\n<p>Fulton County is still seeking to imprison President Trump and 18 others for questioning the 2020 results.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Rabbi Pesach Wolicki’s recent comments during a discussion with Ben Harnwell and Ret. Col. Derek Harvey on Thursday’s WarRoom touched on critical topics such as NGOs, Western civilization, and election dynamics. The Rabbi’s reflections offer a stark critique of corporate media narratives and highlight his perspective on Israel’s role in the broader context of Western values.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"The Western World has kind of forgotten the purpose of actual victory,” Wolicki stated. Drawing a comparison to post-World War II demilitarization and de-radicalization of Germany and Japan, he argued that these processes led to lasting peace and stability. \"Unequivocal victory is the only chance we have to really have peaceful relations with our Arab neighbors,” he added.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolicki addressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, describing many as “bloated NGOs” that pose as international watchdogs but, in reality, are part of a broader narrative that undermines Israel’s position.</p>\n<p>He argued that these organizations, including the UN and the International Criminal Court, have been instrumental in perpetuating false narratives about the conflict. According to Wolicki, the media and these NGOs have propagated two key lies about Israel: the notion that insufficient humanitarian aid is reaching Gaza and the claim of excessive civilian casualties.</p>\n<p>He rejected these claims robustly, stating, “Israel has nothing to gain by withholding humanitarian aid.” He pointed out that aid is reaching Gaza in substantial quantities, with reports showing an ample supply of food and essentials. \"There’s no humanitarian aid issue there except that it’s enriching Hamas,” Wolicki asserted.</p>\n<p>Wolicki said that he believes that the humanitarian crisis narrative is a fabrication intended to harm Israel’s reputation. Similarly, he challenged the narrative of high civilian casualties, highlighting that Israel has taken unprecedented steps to minimize harm. Wolicki cited John Spencer from West Point, who has praised Israel for its efforts to avoid civilian casualties despite the complexities of urban warfare.</p>\n<p>Wolicki’s critique extended beyond the immediate conflict to a broader examination of Western civilization. He suggested that the Western world has become complacent in its approach to conflict, moving away from seeking definitive victories. He argued that this trend has undermined efforts to achieve lasting peace and resolve conflicts effectively.</p>\n<p>Wolicki’s remarks reflect a broader critique of current international strategies and highlight a call for a return to decisive action. He suggested that without an unequivocal defeat of Hamas, any attempts at peace or normalization would be futile. His comments reflect a belief that the global community’s current approach to conflict management, often characterized by ceasefires and de-escalation, fails to address the root causes of radicalization and conflict.</p>\n<p>In discussing Israel’s fight, Wolicki framed it as part of a larger struggle for Western civilization. He criticized American conservatives for not fully recognizing this context, asserting that Israel’s battle is symbolic of a broader clash against radical ideologies that threaten Western values. \"Israel is fighting a battle for Judeo-Christian Western civilization,” Wolicki declared. He emphasized that this fight is not just about Israel but about the preservation of Western values against what he perceives as encroaching radical ideologies.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Rabbi Wolicki on the WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Rabbi Pesach Wolicki Breaks Down Netanyahu’s Congressional Speech</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In Thursday’s conversation between Josh Hammer and Ben Harnwell, the discussion centers around the evolving political landscape in the United States, particularly focusing on the implications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives and the strategic importance of the Rust Belt in the upcoming 2024 presidential election as it relates to radical Democrat Kamala Harris and her candidacy for President and the reason these will be essential topics for victory.</p>\n<p>Hammer emphasized the critical role of the Rust Belt in the 2024 presidential election by highlighting the region’s significance in determining electoral outcomes:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The path to 270 still goes through the Rust Belt. That still goes through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan in my estimation.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Hammer, these states are pivotal battlegrounds, and any candidate aiming for victory must appeal to the working-class voters in these areas.</p>\n<p>Hammer began by critiquing DEI initiatives, viewing them as the successors of affirmative action policies. He argued that these practices have evolved from the race-centric consciousness of affirmative action to a broader framework that he believes still perpetuates discrimination. Hammer highlighted recent Supreme Court decisions, such as the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and North Carolina cases, which dealt a “fatal blow” to affirmative action in university admissions. According to Hammer, DEI is simply a continuation of these policies, which he criticizes for leading to “explicit discrimination on the basis of race against white people, Christians, and Asians.”</p>\n<p>One of Hammer’s key points revolves around Justice Clarence Thomas’s “Scarlet Letter” analogy. He explained that race-conscious practices like affirmative action and DEI initiatives create a stigma or a “badge of inferiority” for the very individuals they claim to support. Hammer stated, “You are a black or Hispanic person who gains admission to a university or is hired in a corporation…you have a Scarlet Letter.”</p>\n<p>He argues that this leads to an intellectual tension in which the purported beneficiaries of these practices are marked as having achieved their positions not through merit but through preferential treatment. This point is crucial in Hammer’s argument against DEI, as he believes it undermines the achievements of minorities by attributing their success to race-based policies rather than individual capabilities.</p>\n<p>Hammer expressed skepticism about the Democrats’ strategy, mainly replacing Joe Biden with Kamala Harris. He questions the viability of Harris as a candidate who could resonate with Rust Belt voters, describing her as a “die-hard leftist Senator from California.” Hammer argues that her political stance, particularly her support for the Green New Deal and other progressive policies, may not align with the interests and values of the Rust Belt’s working-class electorate.</p>\n<p>He also voiced concerns about Harris’s ability to connect with voters in crucial swing states, contrasting her with Joe Biden, who has historically been portrayed as a working-class guy. Hammer suggests that this image has a stronger appeal in the Rust Belt compared to Harris, whose coastal elite background might be perceived as disconnected from the everyday realities of these voters.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Josh Hammer:</p>\n<h1>Kamala Harris’s Scarlett Letter | Josh Hammer Exposes Why Democrats Can’t Engage The DEI Criticism</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent exchange between Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell, Harnwell articulated profound concerns about the integrity of the upcoming 2024 election, emphasizing that the situation is “terrifying” for several reasons. These concerns are grounded in alarming data from Rasmussen Reports and broader observations about electoral vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most alarming revelation is the finding related to U.S. citizenship. In a poll of 2,500 likely voters, 9% either did not confirm their U.S. citizenship or were unsure of their status despite claiming they voted in the 2020 election. Mitchell describes this as “stunning,” emphasizing that it indicates potential systemic issues.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We had 222 people say either no or not sure when asked if they were U.S. citizens,” Mark Mitchell told Harnwell. “This is a striking indicator that our electoral system might be far more compromised than we previously thought.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Harnwell’s fears are primarily fueled by Mitchell’s insights into voter confidence and the potential for electoral fraud, as revealed on Thursday’s WarRoom.</p>\n<p>Mitchell also pointed to self-reported instances of fraud. In his polling, 28% of individuals who voted by mail admitted to committing ballot fraud. This statistic underscores a broader concern that the integrity of the electoral process could be compromised by intentional and unintentional malfeasance.</p>\n<p>Mitchell revealed a significant increase in public concern regarding election integrity on the program.</p>\n<p>According to Rasmussen Reports, 66% of Americans are now at least somewhat concerned that cheating could influence the 2024 election, marking a notable rise from previous years. Mitchell explains, “We’ve seen a shift from under 50% of the population being concerned about cheating in 2020 to 66% now. This is a bipartisan issue, with 78% of Republicans, 60% of Independents, and 50% of Democrats expressing worry.”</p>\n<p>One of the most troubling findings, as highlighted by Mitchell, is the extent of alleged ballot irregularities. “18% of every voter in the country said they received more than one official ballot or a ballot for someone who does not live at their address,” Mitchell notes.</p>\n<p>This figure suggests significant issues with mail-in voting procedures, raising questions about how ballots are handled and whether the system is vulnerable to manipulation.</p>\n<p>Harnwell amplified the gravity of these revelations by framing them within a broader narrative of electoral manipulation and systemic failure. He asserts that the data points to a deeply flawed system that could lead to severe disruptions in the 2024 election. “These findings are terrifying,” Harnwell says. “They suggest that not only is there a risk of fraud, but there’s also a significant lack of trust in the electoral system itself. The fact that 66% of voters are concerned about cheating and that nearly a third of mail-in voters have admitted to fraud underscores a systemic issue that could undermine the very foundation of our democracy.”</p>\n<p>Harnwell’s concerns are compounded by the historical context of the 2020 election and ongoing debates about election integrity. He suggests that the issues highlighted by Mitchell’s data could pave the way for further manipulation and disenfranchisement in future elections. “We’ve seen a lot of talk about electoral fraud and manipulation since 2020,” Harnwell notes. “But these numbers show that the problem is not just talk—it’s a real and pressing issue that could affect the outcome of the 2024 election.”</p>\n<p>Harnwell’s analysis exposed a deep-seated anxiety about the state of American democracy. The rising public concern about reported ballot irregularities and troubling citizenship data paints a grim picture of the current electoral landscape.</p>\n<p>For Harnwell, based on his comments, these findings are not just numbers—they represent a fundamental threat to the integrity of the electoral process and, by extension, to democratic governance.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Mark Mitchell on Thursday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>BALLOT FRAUD SHOCK POLL: 28% Of People Who Voted By Mail Admit To Committing One Form Of Fraud</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Wednesday WarRoom discussion with Dave Brat, energy expert Dave Walsh critically analyzed Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris’s energy policies, mainly focusing on her stance on fracking and the broader implications for the American public.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Kamala has been out in the past aggressively with a full ban recommendation on fracking of oil and gas across the country, a full ban on offshore drilling of any kind. She’s pushing environmental justice and government-capped utility costs, which California has already experimented with. If a full ban on fracking is implemented, we could face massive price increases in energy costs. Natural gas is essential for providing the industrial and technological capacity we’re discussing,” Walsh told Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>FACT CHECK: TRUE</p>\n<p>As the conversation unfolded, Walsh outlined the potential consequences of these progressive policies, drawing attention to how they might impact energy costs, economic stability, and the nation’s energy independence.</p>\n<p>Walsh highlighted the significant role of fracking in the U.S. energy landscape, noting that approximately 70% of the country’s natural gas comes from this method. Natural gas, in turn, accounts for about 42% of the electricity generated in the United States. This electricity is crucial for various sectors, including industrial server centers, data centers, and AI systems that require consistent and reliable energy sources.</p>\n<p>Walsh pointed out, “If a full ban on fracking is implemented, we could face massive price increases in energy costs. Natural gas is essential for providing the industrial and technological capacity we’re discussing.”</p>\n<p>Harris, who has been tapped at the Democrat Presidential candidate as Democrat Joe Biden dropped out earlier in the week, has always been vocal about her support for environmental justice initiatives, which include a complete ban on fracking and offshore drilling.</p>\n<p>Walsh reminded the WarRoom audience that Harris also advocates for government-capped utility costs, as experimented with in California. Walsh criticized these policies, arguing that they could lead to inefficient energy use and obscure the true cost of electricity.</p>\n<p>Walsh explained, “California’s approach, where 42% of electricity costs are allocated back to taxpayers through taxes rather than usage rates, is appalling for efficiency. It hides the real cost of electricity, promoting inefficiency.” He added that the current administration has already seen a 31% increase in electricity costs nationwide, attributing this to the shift from traditional energy sources to renewable ones like solar and wind, which he argues are less reliable.</p>\n<p>The conversation further explores the economic implications of Harris’s policies. The U.S. is a significant exporter of energy-related products, including natural gas and oil, vital for maintaining a balanced trade deficit. Walsh highlighted that four of the top five exported commodities are energy-related, emphasizing their importance to the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>“Our top exports include natural gas, oil, chemicals derived from gasoline, and plastics. These are crucial for stabilizing the currency and managing the trade deficit with countries like China,” Walsh noted. A full ban on fracking, as proposed by Harris, could disrupt this balance, affecting not only domestic energy supplies but also international trade relations.</p>\n<p>Walsh urged policymakers and the public to consider the long-term implications of Harris’s energy policies when voting in November. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach, such as President Trump’s,  that ensures energy independence, economic stability, and environmental sustainability.</p>\n<p>Walsh told Brat, “We must continue to support domestic energy production to maintain a strong economy and prevent trade imbalances. Energy policy should focus on leveraging our natural resources while also investing in sustainable practices.”</p>\n<p><strong>Please share this article to tell your friends about Kamala Harris’ radical plans for our nation. </strong></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Dave Walsh:</p>\n<h1>Dave Walsh Exposes Kamala’s Radical Energy Plan</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Congressman Eli Crane, a former Navy Seal Sniper, joined the WarRoom on Wednesday and shed light on the numerous unanswered questions surrounding the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump earlier in July.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Crane began by expressing his disbelief in the mainstream account of the assassination attempt, stating, “Many of us have been… calling this out for months that, you know, they were going to try and assassinate Trump.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He drew parallels between this event and historical instances where the official government explanations were met with public skepticism, such as the JFK assassination. Crane emphasized that the American public is wary of accepting surface narratives without substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>The congressman criticized the portrayal of the suspect of the shooting as a lone 20-year-old actor, arguing that the narrative seems too simplistic given the stakes involved.</p>\n<p>“I’m not quick to jump to and buy into every conspiracy theorist, you know, out there,” Crane noted, “but we can’t forget all that before we even start looking at the facts of this case.”</p>\n<p>One of Crane’s main concerns was the security setup during Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He highlighted the absence of Secret Service counter-sniper teams on a water tower that provided a strategic vantage point over the venue. According to Crane, “If Secret Service would have put their counter-sniper teams on that water tower… he wouldn’t have even made it close to that roof.” He argued that the oversight allowed the shooter to access a position where they could take multiple shots at Trump.</p>\n<p>Crane also questioned the Secret Service’s claim that the roof from which the shooter allegedly fired was too steep to place snipers. “We walked right up that thing, no problem,” Crane said, emphasizing that he and a 70-year-old colleague easily accessed the roof. This observation led Crane to suspect that there may have been a deliberate choice not to position security personnel effectively.</p>\n<p>During his investigation, Crane visited a building adjacent to the shooter’s position, which he told Brat had a clear view of the rooftop where the shots were fired. The business owner confirmed that law enforcement and Secret Service had full access to the building and likely positioned themselves in strategic locations. “It would have been so easy for anybody looking out that window to dispatch the shooter,” Crane pointed out. He suggested that even with a handgun, the shooter could have been easily neutralized, raising questions about why this was not done.</p>\n<p>Crane’s observations led him to demand accountability and transparency from the authorities responsible for the security that day. “We got a lot of questions that need answering,” he insisted.</p>\n<p>He urged for an investigation to uncover who was responsible for the security arrangements and why certain decisions were made.</p>\n<p>Crane also referenced Robert Hagan’s article from the Washington Post, which he argued attempted to justify an assassination attempt on Trump. “That whole article was an attempt to justify… why an assassination on former President Donald Trump… was rational justified and needed,” Crane stated.</p>\n<p>He pointed out the repeated efforts by the media and political opponents to demonize Trump, drawing connections between this rhetoric and the alleged assassination attempt.</p>\n<p>Crane warned that the ongoing attempts to undermine Trump—whether through assassination, legal battles, or media portrayals—are indicative of a broader strategy to remove him from the political landscape. “They knew they couldn’t beat him fair and square,” Crane asserted, referring to the numerous efforts to impeach, bankrupt, and imprison Trump.</p>\n<p>The discussion with Brat concluded with a call for a deeper investigation into the incident, emphasizing the need to address these critical security lapses and hold those responsible accountable. Crane’s commitment to uncovering the truth resonated with viewers, reinforcing his role as a vigilant watchdog in pursuing justice.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Eli Crane:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

Everybody on it should have been fired,” Paul told show host, Dave Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>Paul criticized the committee’s composition and its handling of subpoenas, suggesting that it was biased and politically motivated. Paul argued that the committee should have been reconstituted with half the seats for Republicans to ensure a fairer process, reflecting his broader concerns about partisan warfare in government investigations.</span></p>\n<p>Paul’s statements add to the urgency for a WarRoom sytle Call to Ation, asking for the WarRoom audience to make calls to the Congress members about the illigitmate nature of the J6 Committee:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Paul’s critique extended to the way the January 6 committee’s actions impacted individuals like Bannon. He contended that the committee’s approach was not just flawed but also a deliberate attempt to undermine its opponents.</p>\n<p>\"I would have voted to get rid of those subpoenas and then I would have also said at that time, we’re disbanding the committee because it was a corrupt process,” Paul told Brat.</p>\n<p>Addressing Bannon’s legal situation, Paul expressed frustration with the lack of repercussions for the committee’s actions. He argued that the Republican leadership failed to use its power effectively to challenge the committee’s decisions.</p>\n<p>\"Republicans have had a terrible job of using the power of the purse,” Paul said. He specifically criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for his vote against the majority of his caucus on issues like Ukraine funding and government spending, highlighting a broader dissatisfaction with how Republican leaders have handled crucial matters.</p>\n<p>Paul also touched on the broader implications of Bannon’s legal struggles for the political climate in the United States. He suggested that the prosecution of individuals like Bannon is part of a pattern of governmental overreach and misuse of power.</p>\n<p>\"The so-called grand jury, which is not really a grand jury because it was a bunch of partisans,” Paul remarked, referring to the partisan nature of the investigations. He implied that such partisan processes undermine the integrity of legal and political institutions.</p>\n<p>Paul’s perspective on Bannon’s situation reflects his broader concerns about fairness, accountability, and the politicization of legal and governmental processes. By emphasizing the need for reform and highlighting what he sees as systemic failures, Paul’s comments contribute to the ongoing debate about the role of politics in legal proceedings and the impact of such proceedings on public figures like Steve Bannon.</p>\n<p>For more context read:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://warroom.org/political-prisoner-controversy-gaetzs-push-for-bannon-prison-visit-sparks-federal-debate-and-call-to-action/\">Political Prisoner Controversy: Gaetz’s Push for Bannon Prison Visit Sparks Federal Debate and Call to Action</a></h4>\n<p>And watch:</p>\n<h1>Senator Rand Paul: The FBI And DHS Has No Right To Regulate The Internet</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>A WarRoom “Call to Action” has been designated after a Tuesday firey exchange between the Director of Federal Prisons, Colette S. Peters and U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL). Tensions were elevated when Gaetz requested a congressional visit to Danbury Prison in Connecticut to see Steve Bannon. Gaetz explained that he and others from the committee wanted to visit Bannon and asked if there would be any issues in approving this visit in the next few weeks. He was met with what appeared to be delay tactics.</p>\n<p>The clip of Gaetz questioning Peters went viral with millions of views.</p>\n<p>WATCH:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GOP brings in the Federal Bureau of Prisons Director to ask her to bypass protocol so they can visit Steve Bannon in prison. </p>\n<p>Just put your damn selves on his visitor list and quit with this performative BS at the taxpayer’s expense. <a href=\"https://t.co/8LecwL74e5\">pic.twitter.com/8LecwL74e5</a></p>\n<p>— Outspoken™️ (@Out5p0ken) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Out5p0ken/status/1815830941727629582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>This activity has resulted in an elevated WarRoom-style call to action to contact Congress about the illegitimate nature of the J6 Committee for their abusive punishments of Bannon and others:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Gaetz exchange happened during the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. The hearing, “Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons,” examined the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) operations, management, and staffing challenges.</p>\n<p>Under intense government scrutiny, Peters responded by stating that the request could be reviewed and considered once submitted to the Office of Legislative Affairs, appearing to brush Gaetz off.</p>\n<p>Gaetz pressed Peters for a more direct commitment to approve the visit, seeking a straightforward confirmation. However, the Director repeatedly emphasized that the approval process involves the Office of Legislative Affairs and maintained that there is a long-standing procedure in place.</p>\n<p>Gaetz challenged this response, noting that Peters was testifying before an oversight subcommittee, which implies that the committee has some authority in such matters, likely referring to a bill that has been passed and is awaiting Democrat Joe Biden’s signature.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Peters maintained that while they encourage cooperation, the approval process is formal and requires departmental review, causing the public to note that she was stalling.</p>\n<p>Gaetz expressed frustration with what he perceived as bureaucratic red tape and criticized the “arbitrary standards” and “non-answers” provided by Peters.</p>\n<p>He urged for even more robust oversight from the House committee, suggesting that without such scrutiny, the lack of clear answers and accountability would persist.</p>\n<p>This stalling by Peters has resulted in elevating greater concern over Bannon’s treatment as a political prisoner ahead of a historic election in November, as well as drawing more scrutiny to other political prisoners from J6.</p>\n<p>Bannon<a href=\"https://warroom.org/bannon-calls-for-bipartisanship-and-transparency-in-a-new-january-6th-committee/\"> has repeatedly called for a bi-partisan</a> House Committee to investigate J6.</p>\n<p>A call to action has been sent out for the WarRoom Posse to call their members of Congress and voice their concern over this troubling set of circumstances surrounding the incarceration of Bannon and all J6 political prisoners, as the US House has now<a href=\"https://warroom.org/fight-for-freedom-house-gop-challenges-jan-6-committee-in-steve-bannons-appeal-as-political-prisoner/\"> filed their legal documents this week</a>, to condemn the Democrat-dominated J6 House Committee as a sham- no one should have been punished from their<a href=\"https://warroom.org/bannon-case-takes-center-stage-as-republicans-rally-against-jan-6-committee/\"> partisan investigations</a>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For fuller context, consult the press release and full video of the hearing:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/oversight-federal-bureau-prisons-3\">Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons</a></h4>\n<p><strong>SENATE HAS PUSHED AHEAD ON ACTION</strong></p>\n<p>Concerns about Peter Navarro’s punishment and Bannon’s, as well as other J6 political prisoners and their punishment, happen during a rare show of bipartisanship, as the U.S. Senate has approved a bill aimed at overhauling the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The legislation, spearheaded by Senator Jon Ossoff, seeks to strengthen oversight of the BOP following a series of scandals and criticisms about its operations. These issues include reports of staff corruption, inmate mistreatment, prison closures, and delays in implementing the First Step Act, which is intended to reduce recidivism and reform sentencing laws.</p>\n<p>Now heading to President Biden’s desk, the bill marks a significant step towards addressing these systemic problems.</p>\n<p>Senator Ossoff has been a vocal advocate for reforming the BOP, having held hearings on egregious issues such as the “rape club” scandal at FCI Dublin women’s prison and widespread corruption at USP Atlanta, which is now a low-security facility.</p>\n<p>These investigations have underscored the urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of the federal prison system, which has been plagued by issues such as staffing shortages, inadequate medical care, and decaying facilities.</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), led by Michael Horowitz, issued a <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-report-federal-bureau-prisons-efforts-maintain-and-construct-institutions\">report in May</a>. The OIG’s reports detail numerous issues within the BOP, including unsanitary conditions, poor healthcare, and infrastructure in dire need of repair.

These inspections will be risk-based, with facilities deemed higher-risk receiving more frequent evaluations. The OIG will then report its findings to Congress and the public, while the BOP will be required to respond with a corrective action plan within 60 days .</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The House filed a brief Monday in the appeal WarRoom host Steve Bannon that seeks to resurrect legal arguments regarding the legitimacy of the House select panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The filing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit argues that the committee was improperly set up, breaking the chamber’s rules, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Bannon is currently serving a four-month sentence that began July 1 while appealing his convictions on two counts of contempt of Congress. According to Roll Call, “The House’s brief, however, does not address Bannon’s other arguments but focuses on the committee’s legitimacy, which multiple courts have previously rejected.”</p>\n<p>This activity has been designated a WarRoom Call to Action. Please call your Congress members to vote to condemn the J6 Committee as illegitimate:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2024/07/22/house-backs-bannon-in-contempt-of-congress-appeal/\">Roll Call</a> reported:</p>\n<p><em>Bannon was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022. He has fought the conviction since, arguing that he relied on his attorney’s advice that executive privilege prevented him from cooperating with the subpoena.</em></p>\n<p><em>In May, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit found that there was no executive privilege involved in the subpoena and that Bannon had a duty to at least respond rather than ignore it. Bannon has since appealed that ruling to the full D.C. Circuit, leading to the House weighing in on Monday.</em></p>\n<p><em>The only other witness prosecuted for contempt of Congress in the Jan. 6 select panel’s investigation, former trade advisor Peter Navarro, recently finished his four-month sentence. Navarro also has a pending appeal of his conviction on different legal arguments.</em></p>\n<p><em>House Republicans have for years criticized the panel, including a resolution last month from Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., that would purport to rescind the subpoenas issued by the panel to Bannon and other recalcitrant witnesses who refused to cooperate.</em></p>\n<p>The brief argues that the committee should have included 13 members, with five from the Republican minority, and had a ranking minority member instead of a vice chair to issue lawful subpoenas. \"In this House’s view, none of these things happened,” the brief states, something Bannon has often repeated on his program.</p>\n<p>Last month, Republican House leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, supported Bannon’s appeal despite opposition from Democratic leaders.</p>\n<p>US Rep Tim Burchett (R-TN) explained to the WarRoom audience on Tuesday that the bill filed aims to invalidate the January 6th committee and its subpoenas. He argued that the committee was “not formed like any other committee” and was “invalid” due to its unusual composition, which excluded certain members and included controversial figures like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. Burchett said, “The bill’s been filed to… disqualify the committee as an invalid committee,” and if successful, it could lead to Bannon’s wrongful conviction being overturned: “The subpoenas would be invalid, and then Steve Bannon’s wrongful conviction would be invalid.”</p>\n<p>He expressed frustration with the slow legal process, stating, “It’s an amicus brief, of course, and it goes before the courts and then it takes their own sweet time.” Burchett also reflected on the broader implications of wrongful imprisonment, saying, “In this country, imprisoning somebody wrongfully is about the greatest breach of trust that you can have,” and added, “I can’t imagine stealing time from somebody’s life and that’s exactly what they’re doing to Steve Bannon.”</p>\n<p>Burchett criticized the delay in legislative action, noting, “I mean, you guys managed to pass a bill to ban gas stoves… but Steve Bannon, it was clear, he’s going to go to prison.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Tuesday WarRoom conversation between Dave Brat and Michele Bachmann, Bachmann expressed deep concerns about the Biden administration’s recent executive order, which she argues represents a significant shift in power within the U.S. government. Bachmann, a former congresswoman, highlighted this executive order’s implications, which delegates presidential powers to the Secretaries of Treasury and State. Her insights into the administrative state reflect a growing concern about centralized power and its impact on democracy and governance.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This executive order essentially sidelines the traditional checks and balances by concentrating unprecedented power in the hands of a few, bypassing not just the Vice President but potentially the entire legislative process,” Bachmann told Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bachmann opened the discussion by explaining the executive order signed by President Joe Biden. She stated, “This executive order is delegating presidential powers to the Secretaries of Treasury and Secretary of State, both as to the Ukraine slush fund and to future executive orders.”</p>\n<p>This move, according to Bachmann, underscores a significant shift in how executive powers are wielded, bypassing traditional structures like the Vice President. “So, if you want to know who’s in charge, I would start there,” she emphasized, pointing to the two Secretaries now holding significant sway in the administration.</p>\n<p>The conversation turned to the broader implications of this shift in power. Bachmann argued that this executive order is not a one-off action but part of a larger pattern where “the people who’ve been playing President behind the scenes for three and a half years are thoroughly in charge now.” She noted the urgency of this situation, suggesting that those in control “intend to complete whatever plans they have prior to the next political puppet moving into the White House come January 24.”</p>\n<p>In discussing the motivations behind these moves, Bachmann touched upon the concept of global governance, which she sees as a threat to American sovereignty. She remarked, “The whole focus of this is to bring down the United States of America, to push the United States into a global governance situation that is opposite of President Trump. He is the anti-globalist president.” This perspective aligns with the broader narrative often espoused by the War Room, which views globalism as antithetical to American interests and sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Bachmann also expressed skepticism about the narrative surrounding COVID-19, especially in light of the timing of the executive order. She cited data discrepancies, questioning the United States’ reporting on COVID-19 deaths compared to other countries. “Joe Biden is this aberration when nobody has COVID; somehow he has COVID and he’s still able to sign executive orders,” she noted, suggesting a potential cover-up or manipulation of information to justify certain political maneuvers.</p>\n<p>In response to Brat’s question about the importance of appointing the right leaders, Bachmann advocated for putting “Grassroots leaders” in charge of key positions rather than “Wall Street globalists.” She stressed the importance of choosing individuals who prioritize “American sovereignty” and “reject global governance,” aligning with President Trump’s America First policy.</p>\n<p>Bachmann’s insights reveal a deep-seated concern about the administrative state and its role in shaping policy and governance. Her comments underscore the tension between national sovereignty and global governance, reflecting a broader debate about the direction of American democracy and the principles that underpin it.</p>\n<p>Executive Orders Delegating Powers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/22/memorandum-on-the-delegation-of-certain-functions-and-authorities-under-the-rebuilding-economic-prosperity-and-opportunity-for-ukrainians-act/\">Memorandum on the Delegation of Certain Functions and Authorities Under the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for UkrainiansAct</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/07/19/memorandum-on-delegation-of-functions-and-authorities-under-section-9902a3b-of-the-william-m-mac-thornberry-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2021/\">Memorandum on Delegation of Functions and Authorities Under Section 9902(a)(3)(B) of the William M.

Bannon, Political prisoner FCI, Danbury Federal Correctional Institution. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This rapid production pace was crucial. Bannon, who acted as co-producer with Fleuette, faced a looming prison sentence for defying a congressional subpoena,a move seen by many to silence Bannon before the November election. Bannon’s commitment to the project, working on it up until his surrender to Danbury Federal Prison, elevates the film’s importance and urgency.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This film is not just a documentary; it’s a revelation that will forever alter your perception of government,” Bannon emphasized in a <a href=\"https://warroom.org/steve-bannons-government-gangsters-premiere-see-it-live-at-the-rnc-preorder-now-exposing-deep-state-corruption/\">press statement</a> about the film before the start of his incarcaration. “May we never need another film like this again.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>“First of all, I’m really happy to be here with you on this side of the camera for the first time,” Fleuette began, reflecting on his extensive collaboration with Bannon over the past two decades. “We’ve done dozens of documentaries together, and Steve sends me probably five projects a day. One day, he sent me ‘Government Gangsters,’ and I thought it was a perfect film to do.”</p>\n<p>Drawing parallels with their previous work, such as “Clinton Cash,” Fleuette highlighted the film’s evolution in tone and scope. “Clinton Cash was primarily about using power and influence to fund the Clintons and their foundations. This took on a darker, more sinister tone, exploring how government gangsters in the deep state operate to try to take down a then-candidate and sitting president, and even up to today.”</p>\n<p>The film meticulously unpacks the intricate machinations of these so-called government gangsters. “We do a deep dive on a very complicated subject, looking at the players involved in these nefarious actions and exposing them all,” Fleuette explained. The goal was to present a complex narrative in an accessible and compelling manner. “It really will blow your head up. It’s one of our best pieces, and we’re really proud of it.”</p>\n<p>Fleuette’s recounting of the timeline reveals the urgency and dedication behind the film’s production: “Like usual, it was like drinking through a fire hose. We started in May, and it took about two and a half months. But we’re built for speed. We know how to operate as a streamlined, small crew that’s worked together for a long time.”</p>\n<p>Fleuette invited the RNC attendees to view the premiere at the Miller High Life Theater. The film is also available for purchase on the War Room’s website. “I think the audience will really like it, particularly if they enjoyed ‘Clinton Cash’ and any of the other films we’ve done. It’s an amazing project.”</p>\n<p>“Government Gangsters,” based on the best-selling book by former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Kash Patel, exposes the depths of deceit and manipulation employed by corrupt bureaucrats and government oligarchs. It reveals their efforts to undermine President Trump and his supporters, offering a stark portrayal of political betrayal.</p>\n<p>As the film premiered amidst political tension, “Government Gangsters” promises to be a powerful narrative, capturing the essence of a tumultuous political landscape and the relentless quest for truth and justice.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.film/\">WarRoom.Film to Get Full-Length Government Gangsters</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Government-Gangsters-State-Battle-Democracy/dp/1637588240\">Book: Government Gangsters by Kash Patel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmMe-2qaSss\">Clinton Cash Full -Length Movie</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJKIeYiKRNk\">Clinton Cash Fox Segment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKZSz_w-Pk\">Fmr Haitian Senate President Sounds off on Clinton’s Pay-to-Play Schemes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/steve-bannon-movies-shows-wrote-directed-produced/\">More Movies by Bannon</a></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment with co-producer Dan Fleuette from the RNC:</p>\n<h1>Fleuette: Government Gangsters Picks Up Where Clinton Cash Left Off</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Friday WarRoom discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Paoletta, the spotlight was cast on the ongoing political and legal struggles involving congressional subpoenas and the Biden administration’s handling of transparency. Paoletta, a former Capitol Hill chief oversight counsel, critically assessed the current administration’s stance on congressional oversight, focusing particularly on the role of Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>\n<p>At the heart of the discussion was the recent controversy surrounding the Secret Service’s response to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Paoletta expressed deep concerns about the Secret Service’s preparedness and the broader implications of the administration’s response to congressional inquiries.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Mayorkas does not have the constitutional authority to prevent the Secret Service Director from complying with a congressional subpoena. Only the President of the United States can assert executive privilege to block an executive branch official from testifying before Congress,” Paoltta told Harnwell. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Paoletta specifically addressed the role of Alejandro Mayorkas in the ongoing scrutiny of the Secret Service. He asserted that Mayorkas, as the head of DHS, lacks the constitutional authority to prevent the Secret Service Director from complying with a congressional subpoena. According to Paoletta, only the President of the United States has the power to assert executive privilege to block an executive branch official from testifying before Congress.</p>\n<p>This assertion comes amid allegations that Mayorkas may be directing the Secret Service to withhold information or refuse to testify, which Paoletta and others view as a troubling breach of congressional oversight. Paoletta’s comments underscore a growing frustration with what he describes as a lack of transparency and accountability from the Biden administration.</p>\n<p>Paoletta’s critique extends beyond the specific case of the Secret Service. He expressed a deep discontent with the current administration’s approach to congressional oversight. According to Paoletta, the Biden administration has consistently demonstrated a reluctance to cooperate with congressional inquiries. He pointed to instances where the administration has failed to turn over documents, attend briefings, or provide necessary information, which Paoletta argues undermines democratic principles of transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>He compared the current situation to past instances of congressional oversight, suggesting that the Biden administration’s stance is particularly egregious. Paoletta also highlighted a perceived double standard in how subpoenas are enforced, noting that while figures like Steve Bannon have faced significant legal consequences for non-compliance, similar accountability does not seem to apply to administration officials.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Paoletta discussed potential solutions and changes that might occur if there is a shift in political control. He suggested that if former President Trump is re-elected and Republicans regain control of Congress, there might be a more rigorous enforcement of subpoenas and a better chance of achieving transparency. Paoletta implied that the current challenges in holding administration officials accountable could be mitigated by a change in leadership, which he believes would restore more rigorous oversight and enforcement mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Paoletta’s discussion sheds light on significant congressional subpoena and administrative transparency issues. His criticism of Alejandro Mayorkas and the broader administration reflects ongoing concerns about the limits of executive authority and the effectiveness of congressional oversight in holding the executive branch accountable. As these issues unfold, they will likely remain a focal point in the ongoing government transparency and accountability debate.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment featuring Mark Paoletta:</p>\n<h1>Mark Paoletta Demands Answer From USSS Director Cheatle</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a compelling exchange on Steve Bannon’s War Room, Peter Navarro and Ric Grenell tackled the thorny issue of media bias, focusing on Comcast’s role in shaping public discourse. Grenell, who contributed a chapter to Navarro’s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Maga-Deal-Unofficial-Deplorables/dp/B0CZ5DLXY8/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1339207583980488&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RDf8T0KmWmKlMc3yR4SUtQS91oUhMaqVf1UO7n8IVyU2ebHP7RqYsGW-NekQwbzYgJpNx5oWq9jZLocBuDsEUHpGTQD9MY1Y8AZdK_8x1mGdvP7SNcna0nEasUMo1S4DL3gD_MBw1mwXeKWI21ttQNkz2UCFea7KqifJWMGeGiJA58IcVDuBkm7m_qggyUkjSe4uYWLCEyuHokMrOxzRui_i8DGMbF-Z6PZ6W6dA6N4.EEblumzYGGrN9iYwoA3WTHPaByRkH6xSiqFFmh-UwTY&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=83700739987358&amp;hvbmt=be&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=105603&amp;hvnetw=o&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvtargid=kwd-83701541517778%3Aloc-190&amp;hydadcr=22536_13494472&amp;keywords=the+new+maga+deal&amp;msclkid=03436aa71a05157293920c3e6aa52ade&amp;qid=1721331876&amp;sr=8-1\">“The New MAGA Deal,</a>” didn’t mince words as he criticized Comcast for managing NBC and MSNBC, which he argued are platforms for dangerous and one-sided narratives.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Grenell began by acknowledging the critical nature of understanding the media landscape, stating, “We have to know the enemy.” He expressed his concerns about the lack of dissenting voices on MSNBC, remarking, “They like everything to completely go their way. No dissenting views.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Grenell pointed out the stark contrast between the need for diverse opinions and what he perceives as the current state of mainstream media.</p>\n<p>He specifically called out Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, suggesting that the corporation has a significant responsibility due to its reach and influence. “Comcast owns NBC and MSNBC, and Comcast is all over the country asking people to give them money for cable access,” Grenell said. He emphasized that Comcast must take accountability for the content aired on its networks, stating, “Comcast has to start getting involved. We have to hold Comcast to account for this. This is not good.”</p>\n<p>Grenell argued that the monopolistic control over media narratives by corporations like Comcast contributes to a polarized society where people are only exposed to a single perspective. He highlighted the danger of such a media environment, “I’ve been watching Morning Joe regularly. The last thing I want is a world where we just had the mainstream media without dissenting voices.”</p>\n<p>Navarro and Grenell shared a common concern about the broader implications of media bias, noting that it extends beyond just Comcast. Navarro pointed out that other media giants like CNN also contribute to the problem. Grenell agreed, reiterating Comcast’s unique position due to its extensive reach. He insisted that consumers must take a proactive role in seeking out diverse news sources. “I think the consumers of news, all of us, have a responsibility to have multiple sources. You can’t just get it from one,” Grenell emphasized.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the impact of media bias on political discourse and public perception. Grenell cited how the media’s treatment of dissenting opinions stifles healthy debate and critical thinking. He pointed out, “You can listen for hours and never hear a dissenting view.” This, according to Grenell, creates an echo chamber that is detrimental to democratic values and informed citizenry.</p>\n<p>Navarro added to the discussion by highlighting the role alternative media could play in countering the dominant narratives pushed by mainstream outlets. He expressed optimism about the potential for alternative platforms to thrive, particularly under a Trump presidency, which he believes would support media diversity. “One of the things he’d be able to do is boost up the alternatives to the pablum and pap,” Navarro said.</p>\n<p>Grenell’s remarks on Comcast expose a critical concern about the monopolistic control of media narratives and the suppression of dissenting voices. By holding corporations like Comcast accountable and encouraging consumers to seek out diverse news sources, Grenell advocates for a more balanced and informed media landscape.</p>\n<p>His call to action is clear: media consumers must demand better and more varied information to foster a healthier public discourse.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Ric Grenell:</p>\n<h1>Ric Grenell: Where Are The Dissenting Voices On Mainstream Media?</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In the WarRoom on Thursday, Peter Navarro told his emotional story of being a political prisoner, freshly released from federal prison, and he issued a stark warning to the American public. Navarro, a prominent figure in the Trump administration, said that his incarceration was a result of political retribution and a systematic effort by the current administration to silence dissent.</p>\n<p>Navarro began by recounting the series of events that led to his imprisonment. The January 6th Committee, formed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, targeted him and demanded that he violate executive privilege.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Navarro steadfastly refused to comply, citing his duty to protect the confidentiality of presidential communications. “The J6 Committee demanded that I betray Donald John Trump to save myself,” Navarro declared, emphasizing his loyalty and constitutional obligations.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This refusal led to a vote by the Democrat-majority House to hold Navarro in contempt of Congress. The situation escalated when Attorney General Merrick Garland, alongside Special Counsel Jack Smith, indicted and prosecuted Navarro for criminal contempt. Navarro pointed out the inconsistency in the application of justice, noting that similar actions were <strong>not</strong> taken against Democratic figures like Eric Holder and Alejandro Mayorkas despite their controversies.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s legal battle continued in the courts, where he faced what he described as biased proceedings. He was judged by Amit Mehta, an Obama appointee, who Navarro accused of stripping him of all possible defenses and ensuring a conviction by an anti-Trump jury in Washington D.C. “They threw me to the wolves of an anti-Trump jury in the D.C. swamp,” Navarro lamented, criticizing the judicial process as being heavily influenced by partisan politics.</p>\n<p>Throughout his story, Navarro maintained that his actions were within the bounds of the law and executive privilege. He highlighted a Department of Justice policy that advises senior White House advisors to reject congressional subpoenas, which he followed. Despite this, Navarro was convicted and sent to prison, a move he described as part of a broader strategy to control political opposition.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s narrative went beyond his personal grievances, framing his experience as a cautionary tale for all Americans. He argued that the current administration’s actions represent a dangerous overreach of power that could impact anyone who opposes their agenda. “If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful, they will come for you,” he warned, urging the audience to recognize the potential for widespread governmental control if left unchecked.</p>\n<p>Navarro also criticized broader policies of the Biden administration, including open borders, the Green New Deal, and rising inflation, which he claimed were detrimental to American workers and national security. He painted a picture of an administration willing to prioritize political goals over the well-being and freedoms of its citizens.</p>\n<p>Navarro called on the audience to take action in the upcoming elections to prevent further government overreach. He underscored the importance of reclaiming control over all branches of government to ensure that such political prosecutions do not become a norm. “On Election Day, America will hold these lawfare jackals accountable,” he declared, framing the upcoming elections as a critical juncture for the nation.</p>\n<p>Navarro’s appearance on the WarRoom in Milwaukee was not just a personal defense but a rallying cry for political activism. His narrative of imprisonment and resistance will serve as a powerful reminder of the potential consequences of unchecked political power and the importance of safeguarding constitutional rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>As he put it, “I went to prison so you won’t have to,” underscoring his commitment to fighting what he sees as an existential threat to American democracy.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire WarRoom segment from Thursday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>MUST-SEE: Dr. Peter Navarro HOSTS WarRoom Following Release From Imprisonment Under Biden Regime</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a revealing segment on Wednesday’s WarRoom,  Monica Crowley joined Kash Patel to share a previously untold story about the Deep State’s actions during the early days of Trump’s administration. Patel, promoting his book and the film adaptation “Government Gangsters,” highlighted the importance of Crowley’s experience with General Michael Flynn and the Obama administration’s alleged interference in the Trump transition.</p>\n<p>Crowley recounted a pivotal moment in December 2016 when she received a call from General Flynn, offering her the role of Director of Strategic Communications for the National Security Council (NSC). Crowley was thrilled to accept what she described as her “dream job.” However, the situation took a surprising turn in early January 2017 when an Obama transition team member contacted her.</p>\n<p>The Obama official informed Crowley of two critical points: Ben Rhodes, Obama’s strategic communications director, had pre-spent the NSC budget for the first quarter, leaving no funds for new hires until April. The official then offered Crowley three staff members from the State Department and CIA, whose salaries were already covered, to assist her temporarily.</p>\n<p>Crowley immediately recognized the implication of this offer. “They wanted me to accept Deep State spies on my team, at least for a period of time,” she explained. Refusing to compromise, she told the official, “I will do this job myself until April 1st until I can get my team.” Crowley’s resolve highlighted her determination to maintain the integrity of the incoming administration.</p>\n<p>Patel commended Crowley’s courage, linking her experience to broader challenges faced by Trump’s transition team across various departments. He warned that similar tactics could be employed in future transitions, emphasizing the need for vigilance and steadfastness in implementing the elected president’s vision.</p>\n<p>Crowley’s tenure was short-lived as the Deep State moved against her the next day, forcing her to step aside to protect her reputation. Despite this setback, she later served in the Trump administration at the Treasury Department, where she had a fulfilling experience. Looking forward, she expressed eagerness for a potential second round of service.</p>\n<p>Crowley and Patel concluded the discussion by reinforcing the need for resilience and adherence to core values in the face of adversity. Crowley’s story serves as a cautionary tale and a call to action for those committed to preserving the principles of the American Republic.</p>\n<p>Overall, the segment illuminated the intricate dynamics of political transitions and the ongoing battle against entrenched bureaucratic interests, offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the Deep State as experienced by key figures in the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this show segment:</p>\n<h1>Monica Crowley Explains How Ben Rhodes Subverted Her Role On The National Security Council</h1>\n</div>\n"

Bergquam’s journey from grassroots activism to becoming a prominent journalist with Real America’s Voice is marked by a dedication to truth-telling, which he told Patel he believes is sorely lacking in mainstream media today.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Reflecting on his path, Bergquam noted, “I was just a grassroots guy in California, saw our country going to hell, and I said, why is nobody telling the truth about this stuff?” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This realization propelled him into a career where he felt compelled to expose the realities he believed were being ignored or misrepresented by traditional news outlets. “This was years ago, this was, you know, back before President Trump announced he was running,” he added, underscoring how long he has been committed to this mission.</p>\n<p>Bergquam’s work has taken him to the frontlines of various geopolitical hotspots, providing him with a firsthand perspective on issues that he feels are often manipulated by the media. “If you guys haven’t watched Ben’s videos non-stop, you gotta go to his social media,” Patel emphasized, highlighting the reach and impact of Bergquam’s reporting. His approach is deeply personal and direct, often involving dangerous and high-stakes environments, which he navigates to bring what he considers the unvarnished truth to his audience.</p>\n<p>In his view, the mainstream media is complicit in perpetuating false narratives. He criticized their response to a recent attempt on President Trump’s life, saying, “The mainstream media, their complicity in this… not a single one of them will denounce the assassination attempt against President Trump.” This accusation underscores his belief that the media is not just failing in its duty to report facts but is actively participating in a broader agenda.</p>\n<p>Bergquam also discussed the decline of traditional media and the rise of what he terms the “ascendant media,” which he believes represents a new wave of truth-focused journalism. “The fake news propaganda media is dying,” he proclaimed, contrasting it with his brand of journalism, which he insists is gaining traction among people who are tired of biased reporting. This sentiment is driven by his encounters with various forms of opposition and danger, including physical attacks by groups like Antifa. “I’ve experienced, you know, Antifa attacking me, the stitches I’ve had on my head, spit I’ve had in my mouth,” he recounted, highlighting the personal risks he takes to report what he sees as the truth.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full Ben Bergquam segment from Wednesday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Ben Bergquam: “We Are The Ascendant Media While The Fake News Propaganda Media Is Dying”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Milwaukee, WI—In the vibrant atmosphere of the RNC Convention in Milwaukee, Congressman Burgess Owens stood against the bustling Fiserv Arena, reflecting with Real America’s Voice correspondent Ben Bergquam about the significance of the Republican event and the state of America under President Trump’s leadership.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This week is not just a convention; it’s a celebration of America’s resilience,” Owens, a former Democrat, remarked. “We’re here to highlight President Trump’s courage, boldness, and his unwavering love for our country.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For Owens and many attendees, the RNC Convention represents a pivotal moment in American politics, where supporters of the America First agenda gather to reaffirm their commitment to principles of freedom, patriotism, and prosperity. “We’ve grown tired of division and negativity,” Owens emphasized. “It’s time to move forward with optimism and unity under America First principles.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the role of the media and its impact on public discourse, Owens didn’t mince words. “The American people are tired of being misled. We’re holding everyone accountable, and that includes the media. It’s time for honesty and integrity in reporting,” he asserted, echoing sentiments widely shared among convention attendees.</p>\n<p>NOT ALWAYS A REPUBLICAN- MAGA FOREVER NOW</p>\n<p>Owens, now a prominent Republican figure and nominee for Utah’s 4th Congressional District, underwent a political evolution shaped by his experiences in football and business. Reflecting on his journey, Owens recalled, “I’ve always been a conservative, and that’s what I realized.” He acknowledged voting Democrat initially due to familial influences but shifted as he embraced conservative values.</p>\n<p>Owens, a former NFL player, transitioned to the GOP later in life, influenced by witnessing Ronald Reagan’s presidency and a desire to build his business. His political career now includes a bid to unseat incumbent Democrat Ben McAdams, reflecting a competitive race emblematic of national political dynamics.</p>\n<p>Speaking on his party allegiance, Owens highlighted Republican principles of freedom and personal responsibility. “More and more Black Americans [are] leaving the Democrat plantation,” Owens noted, attributing this shift partly to President Trump’s policies benefiting minority communities.</p>\n<p>Embracing Trump’s endorsement, Owens emphasized the president’s effectiveness and unapologetic style, stating, “I support any president who will fight for the American way.”</p>\n<p>Owens’s campaign focuses on traditional values and contrasts with what he views as the leftward shift of Democratic leadership. He criticizes opponents for policies he deems detrimental to American ideals, advocating a return to core principles of governance and societal unity.</p>\n<p>From his upbringing in the South to his NFL career and entrepreneurial setbacks, Owens’s journey underscores his commitment to conservative ideals and a vision for a revitalized America. As he prepares for the general election, Owens remains steadfast in his belief that his platform resonates with voters across party lines who prioritize faith, family, and country.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to future elections and policy initiatives, Owens expressed confidence in the country’s direction to Bergquam. “We’re poised to win back the House and the Senate. With President Trump’s leadership, we can implement policies that make a real difference in people’s lives,” he remarked, underlining the importance of translating rhetoric into tangible action.</p>\n<p>Regarding shifts in public opinion, particularly in minority communities, Owens noted a growing alignment with conservative principles of freedom and opportunity. “Communities across America, including black and Hispanic communities, are increasingly resonating with our message,” he observed. “They want to see policies that empower individuals and foster economic growth.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the interview with Bergquam, Owens emphasized the need for unity and solidarity among Americans of all backgrounds. “We’re heading towards a resurgence of American values and unity,” he said with conviction. “It’s a remarkable time for our party and our nation.”</p>\n<p>As the RNC Convention unfolds, Owens’s words about the America First agenda will reach millions of American viewers. The event serves not only as a platform for political discourse for the left that the media loves to cover,  but also as a call to action for the Populist-Nationalist movement of American values.</p>\n<p>Owens’s presence at the RNC Convention shows a commitment to positive change and a vision for a united America. His message of optimism, accountability, and renewal resonates deeply with supporters and underscores the stakes of the upcoming elections and the future direction of the country.</p>\n<p>For more context watch the full interview for the WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Tuesday WarRoom discussion, Donald Trump Jr. and economic advisor Scott Bessent dissected the state of the U.S. economy, highlighting the challenges most Americans face and offering a vision for the future. This conversation highlighted the crucial role of economic policy in the upcoming presidential election, painting a stark picture of the current economic divide under the Biden administration and the years under President Trump.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> “A big part of this election is going to be the economy,” he stated, pointing to Bill Clinton’s well-known phrase, “It’s the economy, stupid.” This sentiment set the stage for a detailed analysis of America’s economic woes.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Scott Bessent described the current state as a “tale of two economies.” He explained, “70 percent of Americans are in a recession,” despite official metrics suggesting otherwise. According to Bessent, this bifurcation is due to the disproportionate consumption by the top 10-20 percent of earners, leaving the bottom 50 percent struggling. He likened the Biden administration’s approach to central planning, paralleling China’s economic model.</p>\n<p>“The upper 10, 20 percent of America consume so much,” Bessent noted. “The bottom 50 are getting crushed.” This disparity is evident in the stock market, where a few high-performing stocks skew perceptions of overall economic health. “If you’re not a holder of those [top stocks], it’s not really the economic marker that people think it is,” Bessent explained.</p>\n<p>The discussion moved to the impact of rising interest rates on everyday Americans. Bessent highlighted alarming statistics: “Auto repossessions are up 23 percent,” and “43 percent of small businesses weren’t able to pay rent that month.” These figures reflect the broader economic strain felt by the working class, exacerbated by the administration’s policies.</p>\n<p>Drawing a contrast with the Trump administration, Bessent remarked, “In Trump 1.0, working-class people did great. Manual workers’ salaries went up two times the managerial class.” He argued that the current administration’s policies favor asset holders while burdening those with debt. “In Joe Biden’s America, you either own assets, or you’re in the bottom 50 percent, and you have debt and you’re getting crushed.”</p>\n<p>Bessent and Trump Jr. agreed on the need for a fundamental shift in economic policy. Bessent proposed, “The first few months of a Trump 2.0 would be to reprivatize the economy,” emphasizing deregulation, reducing the budget deficit, and achieving energy dominance. He stressed, “The only way to solve these problems is through growth.”</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the implications of massive national debt. Bessent warned, “For the first time, interest costs on the national debt are bigger than the defense budget,” making debt a national security issue. He criticized the administration’s fiscal policies, noting, “They’re just putting debt on top of debt and trying to make us into a European-style social democracy.”</p>\n<p>Trump Jr. highlighted the urgency of addressing these issues for future generations. “How does anyone afford a home? How does a young person coming out of college start?” he asked. Bessent echoed this concern, attributing Trump’s popularity among younger voters to their diminishing hope in the American Dream. “They’re losing hope in the American Dream,” he said.</p>\n<p>This discussion between Trump Jr. and Bessent underscored the critical intersection of economic policy and political strategy, illustrating the dire need for a comprehensive plan to address the economic divide and restore prosperity for all Americans.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire WarRoom segment with Bessent and Trump Jr.:</p>\n<h1>Bessent: A Tale Of Two Economies; 70% Of Americans Already In Recession</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Matthew Taylor, the Director of Government Gangsters, provided an in-depth look into the much-anticipated film and its upcoming release. During his discussion, Taylor highlighted the critical nature of the film, which delves into the deep state’s grip on American politics and its implications on justice and governance.</p>\n<p>Taylor announced that the premiere of Government Gangsters will take place at the Miller High Life Theater during the RNC on Thursday, July 18 at 3:00 PM. This premiere is a significant event, providing attendees with the first opportunity to view this revealing documentary. The premiere aims to bring together individuals who are keen on understanding the intricate details of how career bureaucrats, whom the film refers to as \"government gangsters,” have infiltrated various U.S. government agencies, perpetuating corruption and wielding considerable influence.</p>\n<p>Watch a Trailer <a href=\"https://warroom.film/\">HERE</a></p>\n<p>Taylor stressed the importance of this film on the Monday WarRoom program, which is based on Kash Patel’s book Government Gangsters. Patel, who played a crucial role as the lead investigator in Russiagate and co-authored the Nunes Memo with Devin Nunes, provides an insider’s perspective on the machinations of the deep state. The film meticulously documents the last eight years of Donald Trump’s battles against these entrenched interests, highlighting key events such as Russiagate, the 51 Intel letter, and the ongoing struggles against deep state operatives.</p>\n<p>For those unable to attend the RNC premiere, Taylor revealed that the film will be available to the public starting Friday, July 19. He encouraged everyone to visit warroom.film to preorder the film. This website offers the option to preorder and features a trailer and a personal video message from Steve Bannon, recorded before his incarceration, providing further insights into the film’s significance.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained that preordering the film is crucial for several reasons. First, it ensures that viewers are among the first to receive and watch the documentary upon its release. Second, preordering supports the filmmakers’ mission to disseminate this critical information widely. Taylor emphasized that this film is not just a documentary but a call to action for Americans to understand the depth of corruption within the government and hold accountable those responsible for undermining democratic processes.</p>\n<p>Throughout his discussion, Taylor acknowledged the challenges faced during the production of Government Gangsters. He pointed out that there has been significant resistance from various quarters, particularly from the media and governmental agencies implicated in the film. Despite these challenges, the production team, including Steve Bannon, has persevered, driven by a commitment to uncovering and exposing the truth.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Taylor’s comments underscore the importance of Government Gangsters as a pivotal documentary that sheds light on the deep state’s influence in American politics. He urged everyone to attend the premiere at the RNC if possible, preorder the film at <a href=\"https://warroom.film/\">warroom.film</a>, and watch the public release on July 19. This film promises to be an eye-opener, revealing the extent of bureaucratic corruption and calling for accountability and transparency in government operations.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>From the producers about the film: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>From Steve Bannon and the visionary team behind \"Clinton Cash” comes to a groundbreaking new exposé that will leave you on the edge of your seat. \"Government Gangsters,” based on the best-selling book by Former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Kash Patel, pulls back the curtain on the sinister world of corrupt bureaucrats, government oligarchs, and their media accomplices as they conspired to bring down a sitting President, Donald J.Trump,and all those who support him.This explosive film uncovers the depths of deceit and manipulation they employ daily,betraying the very system they vowed to protect. \"Government Gangsters” is not just a film—it’s a revelation that will forever alter your perception of government. May we never need another film like this again. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Government Gangsters To Premiere At RNC On July 19th</h1>\n</div>\n"

Check has given the WarRoom an exclusive on his eyewitness story.</p>\n<p>Secret Service agents are seen on media coverage as they swarmed Trump and ducked behind the podium where he had been speaking. Blood could be seen on Trump’s right ear as agents surrounded him and led him off the stage to a waiting vehicle to whisk him away. Trump is “fine,” a spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>The alleged shooter is dead. One spectator is dead, while two are in serious condition, according to officials.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>In the harrowing account from the Trump MAGA Rally, by phone,  Check recounted to WarRoom correspondent Jayne Zirkle his experience of being near the deadly shooting incident that is now being called an assassination attempt.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This is the most shook up you’ve ever been in your life. And you were about 50 to 60 feet away from someone that was shot. I heard something go off because I thought it was fireworks, but then I heard, ‘Get down!’ and I knew what this was,” Check told Zirkle.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Check described Zirkle as being about 50 to 60 feet away from where someone was shot, vividly recalling the scene as he stood in the front bleacher area. Despite the initial confusion, thinking the noise was fireworks, he said he quickly realized the gravity of the situation as people screamed. The Secret Service ordered everyone to get down.</p>\n<p>“The Secret Service yelled at everyone to get down. I saw the gunman pull out a gun, and everyone got down.I remember that red, white, and blue banner next to me, and the image of the gunman holding his gun before he was shot down.”  gunman was apparently on a roof somewhere, and he was shot dead on the roof.”</p>\n<p>Check detailed the chaos that ensued, noting the image of the shooter on the roof and the red, white, and blue banners that framed the scene. He remembered a moment of terror and solidarity as the crowd chanted “USA, USA” once they knew Trump was safe. Despite the traumatic event, Corey and other attendees joined in prayer, seeking comfort amidst the chaos.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on security measures, Corey expressed concerns about how the gunman managed to get on the roof and pointed out the vulnerability of the open metal gates behind the bleachers. As the interview concluded, Corey was relieved to be safe but remained shaken by the experience, highlighting the need for heightened security at such events.</p>\n<p>“Once the shooting was done, a bunch of us got up and started chanting ‘USA, USA’ for about 10 seconds. Many people were crying. I joined strangers in saying prayers, hoping we lived through it. When we were told to get out, I don’t know what happened to the person who was shot, but my buddy was assisting someone. My concern is how the gunman got on the building. The metal gates behind the bleachers were completely open,” Check said.</p>\n<p>In a statement to his social media, Trump posted on TruthSocial that he was shot “with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,” during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening,” he said.</p>\n<p>Trump thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement for the rapid response and extended his condolences to the family of the person who was killed and the other person who was injured.</p>\n<p>“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country,” Trump said.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Jack Posobiec and Brian Costello discussed several vital points, focusing mainly on the role of US Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH)  and the broader political maneuvers involving Democrat President Biden and the intelligence community. Here’s a detailed summary encapsulating their discussion:</p>\n<p>Jack Posobiec and Brian Costello began their discussion by criticizing the forces they perceive as attempting to undermine President Biden’s administration. They highlighted figures like US Rep. Mark Warner (D-VA) and US Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who they accused of being part of an organized effort to oust Biden from the White House. They suggest a deep-seated conspiracy involving influential congressional figures aligned with the intelligence community.</p>\n<p>The conversation quickly turned to Democrat Attorney General Merrick Garland and the handling of Biden’s fitness for office, contrasting it with the media’s portrayal of Biden’s public appearances. They insinuated that Garland’s close ties to the intelligence community influenced his decisions, particularly regarding suppressing potentially damaging information.</p>\n<p>Brian Costello emphasized the importance of the House Intelligence Committee’s role in holding the government accountable. He criticized  Turner’s leadership, alleging Turner’s failure to support measures that would challenge the intelligence community’s influence. Costello accused Turner of protecting figures like Garland and Biden, citing instances where Turner allegedly obstructed efforts to expose sensitive information.</p>\n<p>They moved on to discuss the controversy surrounding special counsel Robert Her’s handling of tapes. They claimed that Her’s transcripts do not match the actual content of the tapes, implying a cover-up. They criticized Her for not pushing for video recordings, suggesting a deliberate attempt to shield Biden from scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched upon historical government manipulation and control precedents, drawing parallels to past administrations’ tactics to manage public perception and manipulate political outcomes. They invoked examples from the JFK era to highlight longstanding tactics used by entrenched bureaucracies to maintain control over elected officials.</p>\n<p>And there is even recent evidence of a clean-up job for Biden from last week’s Biden speeches. Consider this:</p>\n<p>Posobiec and Costello concluded their discussion by warning against what they perceive as orchestrated efforts to manipulate public opinion and protect entrenched interests. They urged vigilance and emphasized the need for transparency in government actions, particularly in the face of what they describe as imminent political maneuvers designed to influence the upcoming election cycle.</p>\n<p>The Conversation paints a picture of a government besieged by internal power struggles and external manipulation, with figures like Mike Turner pivotal in either challenging or perpetuating the status quo within the intelligence community and beyond. Their discourse reflects a deep skepticism towards established political institutions and calls for greater accountability and transparency in government operations.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full clip with Brian Costello and Jack Posobiec:</p>\n<h1>Brian Costello: Trump “Needs To Call For The Removal Of Mike Turner As Chairman Of The House Intel”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In the midst of a media storm, Tucker Carlson’s influence at Fox News becomes a focal point of Jack Posobiec’s scathing critique on the Saturday War Room. Posobiec’s fiery broadcast lambasts Rupert Murdoch’s grip over Fox News, particularly concerning Carlson’s role and upcoming appearances, notably at the Republican National Convention (RNC).</p>\n<p>Posobiec doesn’t mince words, highlighting the dilemma facing Murdoch and Fox News regarding Carlson’s presence:</p>\n<p>“Tucker Carlson is going to be speaking at the RNC. And Eric Bolling comments, so does Fox cut away from Tucker Carlson in Prime Time, or did they hold their collective nose and run the speech?”</p>\n<p>Posobiec questions Murdoch’s strategy and control, hinting at potential fallout from Carlson’s controversial positions and how Fox News might handle his prominent platform at the convention. He underscores the irony:</p>\n<p>“Are you going to carry Tucker Carlson’s speech after you fired him, Rupert? Are you going to leave him up on your network?”</p>\n<p>Posobiec’s commentary amplifies the tension within Fox News, portraying Carlson as a figure whose views challenge Murdoch’s grip on the network’s narrative and political alignment. By focusing on Carlson, Posobiec magnifies the broader rift between establishment media interests and grassroots conservative movements, positioning Murdoch’s control as increasingly tenuous in the face of divergent voices like Carlson’s.</p>\n<p>Posobiec’s commentary dipped deeper into the RNC events and contrasted it sharply with Joe Biden’s recent rally in Michigan. He derides media figures like Joy Reid and Chris Hayes for what he perceives as superficial coverage of Biden, failing to scrutinize issues such as Biden’s handling of national security.</p>\n<p>Posobiec directs much of his ire again at Murdoch, accusing him of attempting to exert undue influence over Donald Trump’s choice of vice president. He alleges that Murdoch’s agenda prioritizes corporate interests over the grassroots of the Republican Party, favoring candidates whom Posobiec paints as corporate-backed figures aligned with globalist agendas. In contrast, Posobiec supports JD Vance, presenting him as a more authentic representative of Trumpism who would resist globalist pressures and uphold America-first policies.</p>\n<p>The broadcast intensifies as Posobiec singles out the platform given to Kellyanne Conway on Fox Nation, suggesting it reflects Murdoch’s efforts to control narratives that diverge from the populist, America-first ethos of the Trump movement. Posobiec implies that figures like Murdoch, along with Ken Griffin and Karl Rove, are actively working to reshape the Republican Party in ways that undermine its grassroots and conservative principles.</p>\n<p>Posobiec’s commentary exposes a sentiment within conservative circles of distrust towards mainstream media outlets like Fox News, which he accuses of betraying the foundational principles of America First. His impassioned critique resonates with viewers who share his concerns about corporate influence and globalist agendas within conservative politics.</p>\n<p>By positioning himself as a vigilant observer and critic of these developments, Posobiec galvanizes support for a purer form of conservative ideology that prioritizes national sovereignty and grassroots empowerment over corporate interests and establishment maneuvering.</p>\n<p>Posobiec’s Saturday WarRoom broadcast critiques media bias and serves as a rallying cry for those within the Republican Party who seek to preserve and advance the populist, America-first agenda.</p>\n<p>For more context, Watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Jack Posobiec Calls Out Rupert Murdoch For Attempting To Select President Trump’s VP For Him</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The WarRoom hosts and guests will be at the Republican Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, next week and Saturday’s WarRoom was a bit of a teaser about what to expect there. Raheem Kassam, co-host of the Saturday program and editor of The National Pulse, talked to the Editor of Human Events, both long-time contributors to the WarRoom, about recent discussions with<a href=\"https://warroom.org/outside-of-jail-steve-bannon-said-he-expects-fair-treatment-from-bureau-of-prisons-amid-unhinged-left/\"> political prisoner</a> Steve Bannon about what to expect from the week-long event.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“War Room is committed to showing you the realities the mainstream media won’t. We bring you the unfiltered truth, highlighting what others ignore or downplay,” Kassam said on Saturday morning’s program. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In their discussion,  Kassam and Posobiec emphasized the critical upcoming events in American politics, particularly contrasting the Republican National Convention (RNC) with their grim predictions for the Democratic Convention in Chicago. War Room’s commitment to providing alternative coverage that mainstream media often overlooks or downplays is central to their discussion.</p>\n<p>Kassam, who had just <a href=\"https://thenationalpulse.com/analysis-post/what-is-the-rnc-convention-and-how-does-it-work/?feed_id=13131&amp;_unique_id=669296d3798e9\">published an article</a> at National Pulse on what to expect at the convention, started the segment by sharply criticizing Joe Biden’s administration, labeling it a series of mistakes and stressing the need for a flawless RNC. Posobiec joined him and predicted scenes of chaos, carnage, and corruption at the Democratic Convention, drawing parallels to the tumultuous 1968 event in Chicago, which he anticipates will be exacerbated but not adequately covered by traditional media outlets.</p>\n<p>Posobiec echoes Kassam’s sentiments about the importance of Bannon’s WarRoom coverage, highlighting War Room’s role in showcasing past unrest, such as the violence and protests during the 2016 DNC that were allegedly underreported everywhere else.</p>\n<p>BANNON’S HOUSE STYLE</p>\n<p>In fact, the movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2l-M1n_seo\">Trump@War</a>, made by Steve Bannon in 2018, was based on that exact violence and is likely the source of the idea of the WarRoom “Force Multipliers” and “flotilla of ships” (watch to the end).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2018 Stephen K.

They both argue that this is crucial for appealing to independents and centrists disillusioned by what they perceive as systemic election irregularities.</p>\n<p>Kassam issues a stark call to action, urging viewers to actively participate in the electoral process despite any perceived inevitability, citing concerns about election integrity and manipulation through tactics like mail-in ballots and ballot harvesting.</p>\n<p>Their discussion combines strategic political analysis with media critique, emphasizing the need for transparency and vigilance in the face of what they characterize as widespread corruption.</p>\n<p>Through War Room, Kassam and Posobiec aim to provide viewers with an alternative perspective, positioning themselves as champions of unfiltered truth amidst what they perceive as biased mainstream media narratives. This narrative seeks to mobilize their audience politically and underscores their commitment to highlighting what they believe are overlooked or deliberately suppressed aspects of American political reality.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment with Kassam and Posobiec:</p>\n<h1>Raheem Kassam And Jack Posobiec Discuss “The Masculine RNC Convention” Next Week, Potential VP Picks</h1>\n<h1>Raheem Kassam: “The Real Scenes Of Corruption And Deep Division” Will Be Seen At The DNC</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In the WarRoom on Friday, US Rep. Matt Gaetz and Richard Baris, also known as “People’s Pundit,” exposed numerous problems with the state of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party’s prospects for victory in November, heavily emphasizing recent polling data and its implications.</p>\n<p><strong> “This is the ugliest poll for Joe Biden we’ve ever seen,” Baris said and highlighted a dire assessment of Biden’s current national standing.</strong></p>\n<p>Barris pointed Gaetz to internal and public polls that aligned in their negativity toward Biden’s presidency, telling Gaetz that it indicated a significant downturn in public confidence. The Friday conversation centered on Biden’s Thursday night public gaffes, such as confusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Baris suggested had intensified concerns about Biden’s mental understanding and ability to lead effectively.</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing this concern over who is running the country,” Baris emphasized, noting that such perceptions were challenging to reverse through traditional means like economic data releases. He pointed out that typically, it is the Democratic candidate who enjoys a lead in mid-year polls, not the Republican challenger, further underscoring Biden’s precarious position.</p>\n<p>The discussion then turned to the gendered response in polling, with Baris highlighting a significant gap in support between men and women. “President Trump’s lead among men right now is like 28 points,” Baris noted, indicating a substantial advantage for the former president among male voters. This gender disparity, he argued, stemmed from perceptions of Biden’s weakness and decline, qualities that men might find less appealing in a leader.</p>\n<p>Regarding Vice President Kamala Harris, Baris painted a similarly grim picture. He described Harris as facing high unfavorability ratings and suggested she lacked the broad appeal necessary to bolster the Democratic ticket. Comparing her unfavorably to Biden, Baris remarked, “Even in his diminished capacity, I would argue that Scranton Joe is still a more appealing candidate than Kamala Harris.” He substantiated this claim with polling data showing Harris’s poor performance in key battleground states crucial for electoral success.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on internal Democratic dynamics and frustrations. Baris referenced reports of discontent among Biden’s advisors and Democratic insiders, who allegedly feel sidelined or ignored in expressing concerns about Biden’s leadership capabilities.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a spirited Friday exchange, Congressmen Andy Biggs of Arizona and Matt Gaetz delved into the current state of American politics on Bannon’s WarRoom. They focused mainly on the contentious atmosphere surrounding Democratic President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party and their plans to dominate 2024. The conversation highlighted significant concerns about national security, election integrity, federal spending, and the looming political climate.</p>\n<p>Gaetz remarked on the looming influence of former President Barack Obama in the Biden administration, predicting an imminent intervention to persuade Biden to step down from running for President, even at this late hour in the campaign.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Gaetz stated, “I think that meeting is coming where they sit Joe Biden down, and they get Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice, Obama, and they sit down Jill and Hunter and Joe, and they say it’s time for your next patriotic act. You’ve got to step aside so that we can all endorse Kamala Harris.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>Biggs supported this notion, suggesting that the Biden family’s decision about Joe running would be driven by </span><span>personal interests rather than patriotism or concern for the nation.</span></p>\n<p>“It’s going to be about business. It’s going to be about money. It’s going to be about evading accountability for what has happened to our country, and that ultimately, that’s the glide path,” Biggs concluded, exposing the intricate power dynamics and motivations within the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>The conversation took a critical turn towards the Democratic Party, with Gaetz predicting an imminent intervention from key Democratic figures to persuade Biden to step aside for Kamala Harris. “I think that meeting is coming,” Gaetz speculated. He noted growing dissent among Democrats, with several senators and House members calling for Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 ticket.</p>\n<p>Biggs shared an anecdote about a conversation just Thursday night. with Democrat Congressman Greg Stanton, who had publicly asked Biden to step down. “It’s actually receiving critical mass,” Biggs said, highlighting the widespread discontent within the Democratic ranks. The humor among Democrats, such as jokes about Biden talking to lampposts, underscores a deeper sense of despair and recognition of Biden’s incapability to lead.</p>\n<p>Both Biggs and Gaetz expressed skepticism about Kamala Harris’s ability to succeed Biden. “Kamala Harris is not liked by Democrats in Congress,” Biggs stated. He argued that her unpopularity and lack of trust among Democrats would hinder her effectiveness as a leader, especially in battleground states like Arizona. “They know what’s going on with the Border,” Biggs added, criticizing Harris’s handling of the border crisis as the so-called borders.</p>\n<p>Gaetz humorously suggested that Biden’s appointment of Harris might have been the first sign of his mental incompetence. “Anyone that would put Kamala Harris in charge of anything is obviously failed their mental competence test,” Gaetz quipped, highlighting the administration’s perceived failures in addressing key issues like the economy and border security.</p>\n<p>Biggs emphasized tying immigration control and election integrity measures to funding legislation. “President Trump’s right on the money,” Biggs asserted. The only way you will move this forward is to tie it to funding. That’s the only thing they respond to.” This approach ensures states enforce measures that prevent illegal voting and maintain accurate voter rolls.</p>\n<p>The discussion between Biggs and Gaetz painted a grim picture of the current political landscape for Democrats and Republicans over funding issues, with internal strife and dissatisfaction plaguing both parties.</p>\n<p>Their call for fiscal responsibility and election integrity measures underscores the challenges ahead as the 2024 election approaches. As Biggs aptly put it, “This is about the money, the power, the pardons,” emphasizing the high stakes in the ongoing political battles.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment with host Matt Gaetz and Andy Biggs:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Thursday’s Warroom-Battlground, Ben Harnwell and Jeff Clark focused squarely on House Democrats’ aggressive legislative moves targeting the Supreme Court for destruction. Clark characterized these efforts as a retaliatory tactic, driven by the discomfort liberals had with recent conservative-leaning decisions from the Court.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This is a situation in which they realize that they’re trying to intimidate the justices because they don’t like the fact that the Supreme Court has switched from a largely leftist entity,” Clark told Harnwell.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Clark called for the GOP to adopt similarly aggressive tactics to defend targeted justices. He underscored the need for continued scrutiny and support, portraying the resolutions as part of a broader narrative of political messaging and intimidation.</p>\n<p>The Thrusday discussion centered on two key strategies employed by Democrats: Project 2025 and resolutions of impeachment against Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Clark labeled these as instances of lawfare, using strategic legal actions to burden justices with defensive legal challenges, potentially distracting them from their judicial duties and burdening them with financial constraints.</p>\n<p>“They’re designed to increase costs for the justices… It’s part of the general lawfare effort, it’s completely illegitimate,” Clark told Harnwell.</p>\n<p>Clark dismissed the practical success of US Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s recently filed <a href=\"https://x.com/simonateba/status/1811205382187962864\">impeachment resolutions</a>, likening them to political theater rather than genuine legal moves.</p>\n<p>“There is zero chance that either of these resolutions against Thomas or Alito… are going to actually get a majority of votes in the House and then through to the Senate,” he remarked, highlighting their symbolic rather than substantive impact.</p>\n<p>Harnwell echoed Clark’s sentiments, criticizing what he perceived as a double standard in political tactics. He pointed to the involvement of progressive figures like AOC and Rashida Tlaib in these efforts and contrasted it with the GOP’s reluctance to pursue similar measures against liberal justices.</p>\n<p>“These actions are primarily political maneuvers designed to instill fear and make the justices’ lives difficult,” Clark said.</p>\n<p>The conversation turned to judicial propriety, with both speakers scrutinizing Judge Juan Merchan’s involvement in cases related to President Donald Trump. They argued that Merchan’s political affiliations and family connections raised questions about judicial impartiality, suggesting a systemic inconsistency in applying recusal standards.</p>\n<p>Clark emphasized the absurdity of the accusations against Justices Thomas and Alito, particularly in Justice Alito’s case, where allegations centered on his wife’s expressions rather than his judicial actions. He labeled these resolutions as <strong>“the most ridiculous I’ve ever seen,”</strong> emphasizing their nature as publicity stunts rather than legitimate legal challenges.</p>\n<p>As the conversation wrapped up, Clark directed listeners to follow his work and stay updated on developments through social media and the Center for Renewing America’s website. The dialogue highlighted the escalating tensions surrounding the Supreme Court and raised questions about the appropriate legislative and judicial engagement boundaries in American politics.</p>\n<p>The clash between legislative maneuvers and judicial independence continues to unfold against a backdrop of partisan division, with implications reaching far beyond the current political climate.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire segment with Jeff Clark:</p>\n<h1>Clark: Democrats Have Launched Two Parallel Lawfare Efforts To Attack SCOTUS</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>On Thursday, Kash Patel and Josh Hammer talked about Christian nationalism and its implications in American politics as the topic has takenk center stage. Hammer, a Jewish commentator and journalist, critiqued what he described as the embrace of Christian nationalism within the Republican Party during the era of Donald Trump. He highlighted instances where prominent figures like Charlie Kirk advocated for viewing elections as spiritual battles and argued for Trump’s role in restoring morality despite his controversial history.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“America was founded as a deeply religious country,” Hammer asserted, citing historical references that underscored the profound biblical influence on the Founding Fathers. He argued that religious participation in public life, including political activism by Christians, enriches American society and enhances civic engagement across communities</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hammer emphasizes the pivotal role of Christianity in American public life, asserting that a more active and visible Christian presence benefits not only Christians themselves but also improves society as a whole. He argues passionately against the notion that America’s founders intended a strict separation of church and state, citing historical examples and stating that the nation was founded deeply inspired by biblical principles. Hammer links the decline in church attendance to various societal issues stemming from what he calls “woke maladies.” His views reflect a belief in the positive impact of religious faith on American culture and governance, advocating for a robust engagement of Christian values in shaping public discourse and policy.</p>\n<p>To open the segment, a short clip of MSNBC’s commentator, Joy Reid, was played, where Reid trashed the MAGA movement for being too Christian.</p>\n<p>Hammer criticized Reid’s vehement opposition to what she perceives as the growing influence of Christian nationalism, referring to her commentary as a “nuclear meltdown.” He pointed out the hypocrisy in media platforms like The New York Times hosting perspectives that question the validity of voting, suggesting it disenfranchises marginalized communities.</p>\n<p>During the discussion, Hammer contextualized the historical role of religion in American public life, debunking the notion that the Founding Fathers intended a complete separation of church and state. He emphasized that while the First Amendment prevents Congress from establishing an official state religion, it historically allowed states to establish their own churches well into the 19th century, contrary to modern interpretations.</p>\n<p>Hammer concluded by linking the decline in church attendance to what he termed “woke maladies” in contemporary American culture, suggesting that a resurgence in public religious expression could more effectively address societal challenges. He expressed optimism about the positive impact of religious engagement on American democracy and encouraged Christians to embrace their role in shaping public policy.</p>\n<p>In sum, Hammer’s commentary provided a nuanced perspective on the intersection of religion and politics in America, challenging perceptions of Christian nationalism while advocating for a more robust public role for religious values in shaping national discourse and policy.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Josh Hammer On Christian Nationalism</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent impassioned address to the War Room audience, Kash Patel highlighted the show’s overall appeal to it’s diverse audience known as the “posse”, attributing the growing and stable viewer interest to its complex coverage of the multiple diverse issues impacting everyday Americans. Patel talked about the scope of discussions on the WarRoom, stating, “I think the reason the War Room Posse and people subscribe to this show day in and day out, is because of the level of details you get about everyday issues from things like natural disasters to Congress to presidential elections to the southern border to the never-ending Wars, to the CCP, to Russia to hostage rescue operations and to taking on the Norco traffickers and so much more.”</p>\n<p>GARLAND WAS A FOCUS</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Patel zoned in on the injustice in the US House, saying, “Merrick Garland is creating an alternate universe of justice, an alternate system of exoneration, where he claims executive privilege for Biden but would throw any of us in prison for defying Congress. That’s why this election is about the United States Constitution, ensuring one system of laws for every American.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In Thursday’s program, Patel made a direct and urgent call to action, urging listeners to engage with their representatives on critical issues like the contempt of Congress vote that happened in the House earlier on Thursday when Four Republicans voted along with Democrats to give Merrick Garland a pass for the same thing that Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon are imprisoned for.</p>\n<p>He emphasized, “I’m going to ask the War Room Posse to start calling Congress right now and start emailing your representatives.” Patel then highlighted specific congressional actions that had drawn his ire. He pinpointed four Republican representatives who had crossed party lines on a crucial vote concerning Merrick Garland: “Duarte, Joyce, McClintock, and Turner.”</p>\n<p><span>The four Republicans who tried to squash Luna’s resolution: John Duarte (Calif.) </span></p>\n<div><strong><span><a href=\"https://x.com/RepDuarteCA13\">@RepDuarteCA13</a></span></strong></div>\n<p><strong><span> Dave Joyce (Ohio) </span></strong></p>\n<div><strong><span><a href=\"https://x.com/RepDaveJoyce\">@RepDaveJoyce</a></span></strong></div>\n<p><strong><span> Tom McClintock (Calif.) </span></strong></p>\n<div><strong><span><a href=\"https://x.com/RepMcClintock\">@RepMcClintock</a></span></strong></div>\n<p><strong><span> Mike Turner (Ohio). </span></strong></p>\n<div><strong><span><a href=\"https://x.com/RepMikeTurner\">@RepMikeTurner</a></span></strong></div>\n<p>Patel’s critique centered on what he saw as a glaring double standard in justice, particularly regarding Merrick Garland’s handling of congressional subpoenas. He criticized Republican leadership’s failure to initially hold Garland accountable and proposed a solution he termed “inherent contempt of Congress.” Reflecting on Garland’s actions, Patel asserted, “Merrick Garland still broke the law, and Congress needs to be able to rein him in.”</p>\n<p>Drawing on his experience with the RussiaGate investigation, Patel stressed the necessity of inherent contempt as a tool to ensure accountability: “Congress can go out there and say to anyone that has violated their Congressional subpoenas, like Merrick Garland in this instance, and get the sergeant-at-arms to go out and arrest Merrick Garland.”</p>\n<p>Patel’s remarks underscored his belief in the equal application of the law and his frustration with what he perceived as a selective enforcement of justice based on political affiliations. He argued passionately, “We cannot have the top law enforcement officer in our country able to create an alternate Universe of Justice, able to create an alternate system of exoneration.” Patel criticized what he viewed as hypocrisy in the application of executive privilege, contrasting it with the potential consequences for ordinary citizens: “How would it fare if Congress subpoenaed you and said, ‘we want all these documents and if you don’t show up, we’re going to throw you in prison’?”</p>\n<p>Throughout his address, Patel remained steadfast in his defense of constitutional principles, declaring, “To me, that’s what this coming election is about more than anything, the United States Constitution.” He rejected the notion of a revenge-driven agenda, instead advocating for adherence to the Constitution as the ultimate arbiter of justice and fairness: “We have the greatest document in U.S. history, it’s called the United States Constitution. That is our retribution.”</p>\n<p>Patel’s remarks in the War Room encapsulated his deep-seated concerns about the integrity of the legal system and the need for government accountability. His call for action resonated with the audience, reflecting a broader frustration with perceived political maneuvering at the expense of constitutional principles. Patel’s words served to galvanize and educate, urging Americans to engage actively in upholding the foundations of their democracy.</p>\n<p>Make sure to look for Kash Patel’s movie, which will be premiered at the RNC next week, and <a href=\"https://warroom.org/first-premier-of-warroom-films-at-rnc-government-gangsters-dedicated-to-political-prisoner-steve-bannon/\">read our coverage.</a></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire Kash Patel WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Patel Lists The Four Republicans Who Voted Against Merrick Garland’s Contempt Of Congress Resolution</h1>\n</div>\n"

Paoletta, drawing on his experience as a former senior White House lawyer, emphasized the initiative’s primary goal of defending the Supreme Court against what he viewed as unprecedented attacks on its legitimacy. He highlighted recent criticisms from President Biden and Democratic leaders, arguing that these critiques undermine the court’s independence and authority as the final arbiter of constitutional law.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Project 2025 aims to defend the Supreme Court against unprecedented attacks on its legitimacy, ensuring its role as the final arbiter of constitutional law,” Paoletta asserted the project’s mission to fortify the Court during a period of needed radical political scrutiny.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Paoletta pointed to specific instances where the Supreme Court’s decisions, such as those concerning presidential immunity, abortion rights, and Second Amendment protections, have become highly contentious. He expressed concern over efforts by some Democratic senators to call for a special prosecutor to investigate Justice Clarence Thomas, labeling such moves as damaging to the court’s institutional integrity and potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future judicial appointments.</p>\n<p>“Efforts to investigate Justice Clarence Thomas undermine the court’s institutional integrity and set a dangerous precedent for judicial independence,” Paoletta warned, highlighting the broader implications of politicizing judicial processes.</p>\n<p>“Project 2025 is crucial in defending the Supreme Court from partisan attacks and preserving its authority as a check on governmental power,” he said, highlighting the project’s role in resisting political pressures that threaten judicial integrity.</p>\n<p>Then elevated the need for a unified effort to protect the judiciary’s authority and integrity amidst increasing partisan tensions.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a War Room segment on Wednesday with Dave Brat, Matt Boyle revealed an exclusive interview with WarRoom host Steve Bannon.  Boyle highlighted key points from the interview, starting with Bannon’s “next man up” mentality, a concept emphasizing the resilience and bottom-up power of the populist movement.</p>\n<p>Bannon addressed the current dilemma within the Democratic Party regarding President Joe Biden, who he claims is cognitively unfit for office. Bannon stressed the dual crises: a national security crisis due to Biden’s incapacity and a political crisis as Democrats grapple with their candidate. He questioned why key figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney, who witnessed Biden’s decline, chose to remain silent until now.</p>\n<p>Bannon also commented on the NATO summit in Washington, viewing it as a chance for the America First movement to promote Trump’s policies amid global and domestic shifts towards populism. He criticized the media for collaborating with Biden and now facing backlash for the cover-up of his cognitive issues. Ultimately, Bannon welcomed Biden as the Democratic nominee, believing he would be easier for Trump to defeat and cause significant down-ticket damage for Democrats.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We got the candidate we want,” Bannon stated, confident in the strategic advantage this presents for the MAGA movement.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In the exclusive interview conducted <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/07/10/exclusive-steve-bannon-speaks-from-behind-bars-democrats-sticking-with-biden-means-we-got-the-candidate-we-want/\">via email with Breitbart News</a>,  Bannon, currently serving a four-month sentence in Danbury federal prison, Boyle reported, reacted to the Democratic Party’s decision to stick with  Biden as their nominee despite his poor debate performance. He stated that having Biden as the nominee is advantageous for supporters of former President Donald Trump, as it presents a political disaster for Democrats. However, Bannon emphasized that Biden’s inability to perform his duties as President constitutes a serious national security crisis that should be separately addressed.</p>\n<p>In the article, Bannon called for House Speaker Mike Johnson to aggressively investigate Biden’s condition and cancel the August recess to focus on the matter. He highlighted the NATO summit in Washington as an opportunity for the America First movement to advance its populist nationalist agenda, particularly given the recent electoral rejections of globalists in the UK and France. Bannon also mentioned that foreign media leaks about Biden’s cognitive decline indicate a fraying relationship between the establishment media and the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>Bannon introduced the “next man up” concept, emphasizing the populist movement’s resilience and anti-fragility. He argued that targeting leaders like Trump only strengthens their appeal and that the movement’s power lies in the active engagement of its supporters. He called for continued focus on political and national security issues, urging Republicans to address the weaponization of the DOJ, investigate Biden’s financial ties to foreign entities, and prevent illegal voting.</p>\n<p>Throughout the interview, Bannon stressed the importance of exposing the alleged cover-up of Biden’s condition and leveraging it to mobilize American voters. He urged the media to continue scrutinizing Biden and highlighted the critical role of MAGA media in “toxifying” the Democratic process to reveal the truth to the public.</p>\n<p>For more context, read the full Breitbart article and watch the Doyle segment on WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Bannon Speaks from Behind Bars: Democrats Sticking with Biden Means ‘We Got the Candidate We Want’</h1>\n</div>\n"

No time for crying in the War Room.”</p>\n<p>Recognizing Bannon’s irreplaceable presence, Brat asserted, “No one else can do what he does on a daily basis.” He acknowledges the WarRoom team’s dedication, naming “Grace, Mo, Cameron, and the Denver Crew.”</p>\n<p>As Bannon marks July 4th in jail, Brat urges listeners to amplify the platform, prompting reflection on love and sacrifice. Drawing parallels to the Founding Fathers’ resolve against tyranny, Brat rallies, “We’re a nation of individuals under the law, guided by Judeo-Christian principles from Exodus and Deuteronomy.”</p>\n<p>“What Steve wants us to do is redouble our efforts and keep this War Room churning out powerful information that motivates us all to take action,” Brat told the Posse. “Let’s do that for Steve on a human level, let us all pitch in here.

His confinement stemmed from defying a congressional subpoena related to the January 6, 2021, events, which Bannon and the 2024 US House branded an unconstitutional Democrat-led House Committee probe.</p>\n<p>Critics like Madeline Peltz from Media Matters expressed doubts in a <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/steve-bannon/where-steve-bannon-leaves-us\">recent article</a>: “To be sure, War Room will suffer without him in the short term. For the past several years, the show has been the center of the MAGA media universe, and neither his proposed list of guest hosts nor his <strong>ragtag staff</strong> will be able to supplant his relentless work ethic and talent for far-right messaging. While it’s possible he’ll get messages out through other media figures, his ability to communicate will surely be diminished during this period, and that is a blow to his movement.”</p>\n<p>Despite detractors like Media Matters, it was a full week of excellent hosts and guests moving the America First agenda ahead.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Bannon walked into prison on his own, <a href=\"https://warroom.org/outside-of-jail-steve-bannon-said-he-expects-fair-treatment-from-bureau-of-prisons-amid-unhinged-left/\">expecting fair treatment</a> and expressing no worry about mistreatment.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>The U.S. Constitution, while not explicitly mentioning “Rule of Law,” enshrines principles crucial to its concept. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments mandate due process, ensuring fair treatment under the law. The Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause guarantees uniformity in law application. The Constitution’s separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches prevents concentration of power, fostering checks and balances. The Bill of Rights further secures freedom of speech, religion, and fair trials.</p>\n<p>Together, these provisions establish a framework to protect citizens from arbitrary government actions and promote a legal system guided by fairness, equality, and constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>Those issues should be on the American people’s minds as they vote in November.</p>\n<p>One of the significant choices facing the American people this election cycle is whether they prefer a Department of Justice guided by groups like PolicyLink, advocating for far-left policies such as criminal rehabilitation, DEI, and social justice, or one influenced by groups like the Heritage Foundation, which prioritizes Constitutional principles like the Rule of Law in its justice reforms.</p>\n<p>Project 2025 is under intense media scrutiny. Let’s examine its reform measures to discover why they’ve sparked such media agitation.</p>\n<p>WHAT IS THE MEDIA SAYING?</p>\n<p>“The 922-page plan outlines <span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-conservatives-trump-heritage-857eb794e505f1c6710eb03fd5b58981\">a dramatic expansion</a></span> of presidential power and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers to replace them with Trump loyalists. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has worked to draw more attention to the agenda, particularly as Biden tries to keep fellow Democrats on board after his disastrous debate,” the AP <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-project-2025-biden-9d372469033d23e1e3aef5cf0470a2e6\">reported</a> on Saturday.</p>\n<p>WHY ARE THEY SO FRANTIC ABOUT IT?</p>\n<p>Project 2025 faces negative mainstream media coverage, particularly regarding its recommendations on highly charged political issues, like immigration reforms outlined in the DOJ section.</p>\n<p><strong>“Examine and consider the appropriateness of withdrawing or overturning every immigration decision rendered by Attorney General Garland (and any successor Attorney General during President Biden’s term),” Gene Hamilton writes on page 567 of the Project 2025 mandate for Conservative Leadership manual that has gotten wide coverage from the media- with most of the coverage from the corporate media being wrong. </strong></p>\n<p>WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY?</p>\n<p>According to Gene Hamilton, who authored chapter 17 of Project 2025’s manual on the topic of reforming the Department of Justice (DOJ), the DOJ has a long and noble history, beginning with the creation of the Office of the Attorney General in 1789 and evolving through the formation of the department in 1870 and the FBI in 1908, along with reforms following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p>Hamilton writes that traditionally, the DOJ’s primary functions have been protecting public safety and defending the rule of law within the framework of a constitutional republic. However, in recent years, the DOJ has lost the trust of many Americans, who see it as overly politicized and corrupt, just as WarRoom <a href=\"https://warroom.org/crisis-of-confidence-the-dojs-integrity-under-scrutiny-ahead-of-the-2024-election/\">has reported. </a></p>\n<p>This distrust stems from the department being perceived as controlled by an unaccountable bureaucratic class and radical left ideologues, leading to a failure to focus on its core functions. As a result, 46.6 percent of Americans view the DOJ as “too political, corrupt, and not to be trusted.” The weight of publicly available evidence supports these concerns.</p>\n<p>HOW DID THE DOJ GET SO CORRUPT?</p>\n<p>Project 2025, is in contrast with one of Democrat Joe Biden’s favorite groups, Policy Link, which sponsored Kamala Harris’s sister,  Maya Harris, to author this <a href=\"https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/organized-for-change\">2004 mandate</a> to reform and defund the police.</p>\n<p>The very influential group for the left is the same group that <a href=\"https://x.com/kalimarose/status/1353082824220282880\">issued a mandate</a> for the first 100 days of the Biden administration in 2021 and who <a href=\"https://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/Criminal_Legal_Memo.pdf\">continues to lobby</a> the Federal government for more funding for their reform measures- which focus on healing racial issues and healing criminals.</p>\n<p>Heritage Action has written a manual and set up an agency to do the opposite of defunding the police and concentrating on the healing of criminals- shifting a legislative and policy agenda to focus the DOJ on public safety and the rule of law.</p>\n<p>THE PURPOSE OF REFORMING THE DOJ, ACCORDING TO PROJECT 2025- RETURN TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND RULE OF LAW</p>\n<p>Hamilton writes that the DOJ, under AG Merrick Garland, has strayed from impartiality, becoming a bureaucracy influenced by a radical liberal agenda. Reform is crucial to restore trust and national interest.</p>\n<p>Successful reform of the DOJ requires a comprehensive, leadership-driven effort to repair damage and advance national interests, involving both internal changes and legislative support. Focus areas include restoring the FBI’s integrity, renewing attention to violent crime, dismantling criminal enterprises, and addressing national security threats without infringing on constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>The DOJ must recommit to protecting public safety and enforcing laws impartially, addressing issues such as immigration enforcement, political bias in prosecution, and the proper handling of misinformation. Ensuring public safety and upholding the rule of law are paramount to regaining public trust and maintaining ordered liberty.</p>\n<p>Hamilton explains in great detail that restoring the FBI’s integrity requires comprehensive reforms. Founded in 1908 to tackle national crime and security, the FBI must refocus on violent crime, criminal organizations, child predators, and cyber-crime. Recent scandals, like the Russia hoax and suppression of Hunter Biden’s laptop, indicate the FBI is out of control. A conservative administration should review all major FBI investigations, align the FBI within the DOJ’s structure, prohibit it from policing misinformation, and streamline non-law enforcement functions. Emphasizing field offices over headquarters and proposing to eliminate the 10-year term for the FBI Director are crucial steps in restoring trust and effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Gene Hamilton is Vice-President and General Counsel of America First Legal Foundation. Gene served as Counselor to the Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice; Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Homeland Security; General Counsel on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary; Assistant Chief Counsel at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and as an Attorney Advisor in the Secretary’s Honors Program for Attorneys at the Department of Homeland Security. Gene graduated from the Washington and Lee University School of Law magna cum laude and Order of the Coif and has a BA in international affairs from the University of Georgia.</p>\n<p>The chapter by Hamilton goes into greater detail on other vital issues.</p>\n<p>This is part of a series on the choices the American people have to make in the 2024 election.</p>\n<p>For more context on Project 2025, read their manual: <a href=\"https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">LINK</a></p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Understanding public trust in the Department of Justice (DOJ) before the 2024 election is crucial because it directly impacts the legitimacy of the electoral process and the enforcement of laws that govern it. Public perception of the DOJ’s integrity and impartiality influences voter confidence in the fairness and transparency of elections. If a significant portion of the population views the DOJ as politically biased or corrupt, it can undermine faith in election outcomes, exacerbate political polarization, and fuel civil unrest. Moreover, the DOJ is critical in addressing electoral disputes, safeguarding voting rights, and ensuring that election laws are upheld. Therefore, gauging and addressing public trust in the DOJ is essential to maintaining democratic stability and ensuring that the 2024 election is conducted in an environment of trust and confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>THIS IS WHAT WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT</strong></p>\n<p>Public perception of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is increasingly skeptical, with many Americans viewing the institution as overly politicized and unreliable. This distrust is fueled by several high-profile controversies and actions that have raised concerns about the integrity and impartiality of the DOJ.</p>\n<p>According to polling, these factors have contributed to a growing belief that the DOJ is not functioning as an impartial guardian of justice but rather as a politically driven entity. This perception is reflected in surveys and public discourse, with many calling for reforms to restore trust and ensure the DOJ operates free from political influence.</p>\n<p>According to a<a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/department-justice-top-management-and-performance-challenges-2023/public-trust\"> 2023 report</a> from the US Department of  Justice Office of Inspector General, we have a problem to be worried about:</p>\n<p><strong>“Public trust in the federal government has approached near record lows.[1]  As of June 2023, fewer than 2-in-10 Americans say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right \"just about always” (1 percent) or \"most of the time” (15 percent).  These are among the lowest trust measures in nearly 7 decades of polling.  In light of today’s wide-spread lack of trust and negative views of government, a key facet of the Department’s challenge of strengthening public trust is ensuring that DOJ personnel fulfill their duties without any actual or perceived political influence or partisan consideration.”</strong></p>\n<p>But that doesn’t seem to be going very well, according to public polling.</p>\n<p>Key issues contributing to this negative perception were identified in a <a href=\"https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/COSA-FBI_DOJ-Opinion-Full-Report-0824.pdf\"> survey</a> by Trafalgar, which revealed that 46.6% of Americans view the Department of Justice (DOJ) as overly political, corrupt, and untrustworthy.</p>\n<p>Several key points of concern back this perception:</p>\n<p><strong>FBI’s Russia Collusion Narrative:</strong> Despite knowing that claims of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia were false, the FBI collaborated with Democratic operatives to propagate this story during the 2016 election. This involved strategic media leaks, falsifying FISA warrant applications, and lying to Congress.</p>\n<p><strong>Hunter Biden Laptop Story:</strong> The FBI convinced social media companies and the broader media that the story about Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation, even though they had the laptop and could have verified its authenticity.</p>\n<p><strong>Parental Free Speech Rights:</strong> The DOJ acted against parents across the U.S. in response to alleged threats against school boards, while failing to protect Americans from actual violence, such as attacks on pregnancy care centers.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Media Monitoring:</strong> The FBI monitored social media for “misinformation” or “disinformation,” flagging content not tied to any criminal conspiracy for removal by platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>Domestic Influence Operations:</strong> The FBI pressured social media companies to report more foreign influence than was actually occurring, aiming to suppress true information relevant to the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n<p><strong>Selective Prosecutions:</strong> The DOJ has aggressively prosecuted American citizens for minor offenses while dismissing cases against radical leftist groups such as Antifa.</p>\n<p><strong>Chilling Disfavored Conduct:</strong> The DOJ has threatened that actions not aligning with the liberal agenda “could” violate federal law, using the threat of litigation and sanctions to suppress state efforts on issues like abortion restrictions or preventing genital mutilation of children.</p>\n<p><strong>Election Integrity Lawsuits:</strong> The DOJ has sued multiple states over their efforts to enhance election integrity, indicating a contentious stance on state-level election regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>WARROOM AND GUESTS ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES: </strong></p>\n<p>In general, most of the guests on the program would agree that to address the critical issue of restoring public trust in the DOJ, several comprehensive and strategic reforms must be implemented. These solutions focus on increasing transparency, accountability, and impartiality within the DOJ to rebuild confidence in its operations and ensure it functions as an unbiased enforcer of the law.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Transparency:</strong> The DOJ should increase transparency by publicly disclosing decision-making processes and criteria for investigations and prosecutions. This includes providing detailed explanations for high-profile cases and clarifying the reasons behind prosecutorial decisions to counter perceptions of bias.</p>\n<p><strong>Independent Oversight:</strong> Establishing stronger independent oversight mechanisms is crucial. An independent review board or inspector general with the authority to investigate claims of misconduct or political influence within the DOJ can help ensure accountability and foster public trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Bipartisan Leadership:</strong> Appointing bipartisan leadership at key positions within the DOJ can help mitigate perceptions of political bias. Leaders with a reputation for impartiality and a commitment to justice should be prioritized to reinforce the department’s integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Clear Communication Policies:</strong> The DOJ should implement clear communication policies that prevent unauthorized leaks and ensure consistent and accurate information is provided to the public. This would address concerns about strategic media leaks and misinformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus on Equal Enforcement:</strong> Ensuring that laws are enforced equally, regardless of political affiliation, is essential. The DOJ must demonstrate a balanced approach in its prosecutions, avoiding the appearance of selectively targeting specific groups or individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Training and Education:</strong> Providing ongoing training for DOJ personnel on ethical standards, impartiality, and the importance of public trust can help reinforce the department’s commitment to unbiased law enforcement.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> Engaging with the public through town halls, forums, and other outreach initiatives can help the DOJ better understand and address public concerns. Open dialogue with communities can also help rebuild trust and demonstrate a commitment to serving all citizens fairly.</p>\n<p><strong>Reevaluating Priorities:</strong> The DOJ should periodically reevaluate its priorities and focus on addressing crimes and issues that most concern the public. This includes taking strong actions against all forms of violence and protecting the rights of all citizens.</p>\n<p>By implementing these reforms, the DOJ can work towards restoring its reputation as an impartial and trustworthy institution. This, in turn, will enhance public confidence in the justice system and ensure a fair and transparent electoral process leading up to the 2024 election.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Mark Mitchell, a polling analyst with Rasmussen Reports, appeared on the Saturday episode of the WarRoom and provided a detailed breakdown of the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, highlighting<a href=\"https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2024/after_debate_disaster_55_think_democrats_should_dump_biden\"> recent</a> significant shifts in voter sentiment and the implications for Democratic voters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“After the debate, many commentators said that Joe Biden should step aside as this year’s presidential candidate and let the Democratic party choose another candidate. 65% of voters agreed with that statement,” Mitchell told host, Dave Brat. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mitchell emphasized the debate’s seismic impact on public opinion, pointing out dramatic swings in favor of former President Donald Trump among various demographic groups.</p>\n<p>Mitchell began by underscoring the overwhelming consensus among likely American voters that Donald Trump decisively won the debate, with a striking 35-point margin (57% to 22%) over Joe Biden.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“American likely voters told us that Donald Trump won the debate by an astounding 57 to 22 percent. That is a 35-point margin when pre-debate it was only a 10-point margin,” Mitchell told Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This marked a sharp increase from a pre-debate 10-point margin, indicating a substantial shift in public perception in just one week. He noted that a significant % of the electorate, 88%, reported watching at least part of the debate, with 53% watching it in its entirety.</p>\n<p>Mitchell highlighted the profound changes in attitudes among specific voter groups, particularly among Black voters and Democrats. Pre-debate expectations favored Biden by 34 points among Black voters, but post-debate, Trump held a significant advantage of 19 points—a swing of 43 points. Similarly, Democratic voters, who initially favored Biden by 52 points pre-debate, saw their support drop to a 20-point lead for Biden post-debate—a 32-point swing toward Trump.</p>\n<p>Mitchell emphasized that only 45% of Democrats believed Biden won the debate, compared to 25% who thought Trump did, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction among the party faithful. Moreover, Mitchell pointed out that there was significant discourse, even among commentators, after the debate about whether Biden should step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate. A notable 65% of voters agreed that Biden should step aside, with strong sentiment (38%) supporting this view.</p>\n<p>Looking at potential replacements for Biden, Mitchell highlighted Kamala Harris’s prospects, noting that while some favored her as a replacement candidate, a majority (50%) of voters believed the Democratic Party should choose someone else. This sentiment was echoed across demographic lines, including among Black voters and women, where Harris did not garner strong support as Biden’s potential replacement.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s analysis underscored a profound shift in Democratic voter sentiment following the debate, with implications for the upcoming presidential race. He suggested that the debate’s outcome had exacerbated existing concerns about Biden’s candidacy, particularly regarding issues of age and performance. Mitchell also hinted at the influence of mainstream media on shaping voter perceptions, suggesting that media narratives and coverage could play a pivotal role in shaping future political dynamics.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Mitchell’s insights painted a picture of significant turbulence within Democratic ranks, with a growing chorus of voices questioning Biden’s viability as the party’s standard-bearer. The data he presented highlighted a critical juncture in the election cycle, where public opinion and media dynamics could heavily influence the Democratic Party’s strategy moving forward.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Mark Mitchell Offers Insight Into Large Divide Within The Democrat Party Over Next Presidential Nominee</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Marine Le Pen, a Populist, continues to attract intense media attention ahead of important Sunday elections in France. On Friday, Le Pen sat down with CNN for an interview with Christiane Amanpour and talked about what the media reported on her controversial \"National Preference” policy that her National Rally party hopes to enforce if they win the French elections.</p>\n<p>Le Pen argues that her approach to immigration is about nationality, not origin. She aims to grant French citizens extra rights, which contrasts with the rights of immigrants.</p>\n<p>Nationalism remains a pivotal issue in elections worldwide, particularly in nations where massive immigration has raised significant concerns, including in France. CNN’s focus on French nationality in their Friday interview indicates the broader debate over national identity, social cohesion, and the rights of immigrants versus those of native-born citizens. As Le Pen signals, this discussion highlights the tensions and policy challenges in societies grappling with integrating diverse populations while maintaining national priorities.</p>\n<div>\n<div>From the CNN interview<a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/it-s-not-about-origin-marine-le-pen-defends-controversial-national-preference-policy/vi-BB1pu1aU?ocid=socialshare\"> clip (Link)</a>:</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Christiane Amanpour:</strong> This concept that you have of national preference. It’s said that you and Mr. Bardella mentioned to the FT that to have France for the French, housing, certain jobs, and certain social assistance would be a matter of origin. As you said, it would go to French people. How does that work? And is that even constitutional? Can you distinguish between the public assistance given to French-born citizens versus those who are immigrants, who also pay taxes and social security, etc.?</p>\n<p><strong>Marine Le Pen:</strong> First of all, it’s not a national preference; it’s a national priority. So, it is exercised in several areas. Firstly, in social housing, for example. The idea is very simple. We’re going to house people in social housing that has been paid for by the French, their parents, and their grandparents over the generations. We’re going to give priority to those who have French nationality, whatever their origin. It’s about French nationals.</p>\n<p>When French people meet the criteria and are prioritized, the remaining social housing units can be allocated to foreigners. If you like, the principle is clear. When it comes to contributive benefits, i.e., those that foreigners pay contributions towards, we won’t touch them. It’s a topic we’ve already tackled since during the 2022 campaign, we specifically said we wanted to be able to change the Constitution to allow French citizens to be granted extra rights attached to their nationality, beyond those granted to foreigners.</p>\n<p>The French already have a right that foreigners do not—it’s the right to vote. It’s not about origin or anything else; it’s just a question of nationality, of belonging to a country, and citizenship. Why? Because foreigners who are present in our country, and whom we respect, are perfectly able to stay here if they work and respect the laws, etc. The fact remains that they are in France but have another country, while the French only have one.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT THE MEDIA IS REPORTING</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also faces a pivotal moment as the second round of legislative elections unfolds. With his centrist bloc finishing third in the first round, behind the far right, Macron’s influence on defense and foreign affairs could be significantly diminished, according to AP reporting on Saturday. Analysts and retired military officers suggest that the election results may impact Macron’s role as a prominent European figure and Ukraine supporter against Russia.</p>\n<p>Media reports say Macron’s camp is unlikely to secure an absolute majority, having already lost many candidates. According to French media, the likely outcomes are either a fragmented parliament with a weak prime minister or, worse for Macron, a victory for the far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen’s protégé, Jordan Bardella. Bardella, as prime minister, would challenge Macron’s defense and foreign policy powers, particularly regarding Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The French Constitution provides limited guidance on resolving potential conflicts between the president and the prime minister. Bardella has set “red lines” against sending long-range weaponry to Ukraine and deploying troops, fearing a nuclear confrontation with Russia. This stance contrasts with Macron’s more proactive military approach.</p>\n<p>Power-sharing could lead to a political deadlock, with the president and prime minister potentially blocking each other’s actions. This scenario poses challenges for the French military, which operates globally. Analysts express concerns about maintaining France’s commitments to its international allies under such divided leadership.</p>\n<p>The media is reporting that a coalition government may be necessary if no clear majority emerges. This would require consensus-building and potentially delay critical foreign policy decisions. This new arrangement would constrain Macron’s control, marking a shift from France’s traditionally solid presidential system.</p>\n</div>\n"

He points to Bannon’s critique of elitism and globalism within both major parties, arguing that these ideologies have marginalized working-class Americans and undermined national sovereignty.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> \"Project 2025 is about redefining governance to align with constitutional principles and the will of the American people,” Brat asserts.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Howell offers a critical perspective on the implementation challenges facing Project 2025, noting that its success hinges on mobilizing grassroots support and navigating legal and institutional barriers. He highlights Bannon’s strategic approach to leveraging public discontent and rallying support behind a populist agenda, which Howell views as both a strength and a potential liability. \"The success of Project 2025 hinges on navigating legal barriers and mobilizing a broad coalition of supporters,” Howell observes.</p>\n<p>Brat underscores Bannon’s role as a captivating figure who has galvanized a significant segment of the American public disillusioned with traditional politics. \"Bannon’s leadership in Project 2025 is defined by his critique of elitism and globalism within both major parties,” Brat says.</p>\n<p>Throughout their discussion, Brat and Howell convey a sense of confidence regarding Project 2025’s potential to reshape the political landscape leading up to the 2024 elections. They discuss Bannon’s strategy of harnessing discontent over immigration and economic disparity to mobilize voters and challenge incumbent politicians aligned with establishment interests.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"Bannon aims to mobilize grassroots support by addressing issues like immigration and economic fairness,” Brat notes.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Brat and Howell emphasize the projects potential to disrupt traditional political dynamics and redefine the agenda for American governance, while acknowledging the formidable challenges it faces in achieving its goals.</p>\n<p>For all WarRoom.org content on Project 2025: <a href=\"https://warroom.org/?s=Project+2025\">LINK</a></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Howell: Heritage Investigation Finds 10% Of Illegal Aliens Investigated Are Registered To Vote]</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a lively Friday discussion, Peter McIlvenna, host of the Hearts of Oak podcast, and Ben Harnwell, acting host of the WarRoom, two UK broadcasters, delve into the burgeoning global populist movements. They examine the recent UK election results, the dynamics of populist leaders, and the alignment of these movements on critical issues such as illegal immigration and the much-needed re-election of President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Both men expressed strong concerns about Western civilization’s current state and future. They argued that it is at a critical juncture, facing numerous challenges that threaten its core values and stability.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Western civilization is not a geographical expression but a global force for good. It is the source of our deepest values and most cherished principles—liberty, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. In defending Western civilization, we defend the very foundation of our free societies and the essence of what makes us who we are,” Harnwell said.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>McIlvenna</strong> highlighted the need to revive Western civilization’s foundational principles, emphasizing the importance of national sovereignty, cultural identity, and economic independence. He stressed that populist movements across Europe and the United States are vital in addressing these issues and resisting globalist agendas that undermine national interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Harnwell</strong> echoed these sentiments, pointing out that leaders like Donald Trump, Nigel Farage, and other populist figures are crucial in defending Western civilization against external and internal threats. He emphasized the role of these leaders in promoting policies that safeguard national borders, support traditional values and prioritize the well-being of their citizens over internationalist goals.</p>\n<p>Both McIlvenna and Harnwell agreed that Donald Trump’s re-election would be a pivotal moment for Western civilization. They argued that Trump’s leadership could inspire and strengthen populist movements globally, leading to a more cohesive and resilient Western world.</p>\n<p>This, they suggested, would be essential in countering the challenges posed by rising authoritarianism, unchecked immigration, and the erosion of cultural and national identities.</p>\n<p>In the WarRoom, McIlvenna and Harnwell highlighted the significant shift in the UK political landscape after the surprising election of Fraage on Thursday, noting the implosion of the Tory party’s vote and the resurgence of populist sentiment.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The Tory vote absolutely imploded,” McIlvenna states, pointing out that this collapse reflects a broader rejection of the national center-right politics. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Harnwell agrees, adding that this marks a new paradigm in British electoral politics, much like the rise of  Farage and the Reform Party, which has captured the disillusionment of many voters.</p>\n<p>McIlvenna critically observed the disconnection between the government and the electorate. “Our government is with one-fifth of the voting population saying we want them,” he notes, emphasizing the lack of genuine support for the ruling party.</p>\n<p>This sentiment is echoed in the rise of populist movements across Europe, where leaders like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Georgia Meloni in Italy are gaining traction by addressing similar issues of national identity, immigration, and economic sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The discussion turns to the charismatic leadership of figures like Farage and Trump. McIlvenna highlights Farage’s unique ability to engage with the public, describing him as a “charismatic leader who engages with the people and has got the party where they are in six weeks.” This rapid rise mirrors Trump’s influence in the United States, where his populist rhetoric and policy positions resonate with a significant portion of the American electorate.</p>\n<p>Trump’s influence on the global populist movement is undeniable. Harnwell notes that “Donald Trump sent a message of congratulations to Nigel Farage,” highlighting the transatlantic connection between these leaders. Their shared vision of challenging the political establishment and advocating for policies prioritizing national interests further solidifies this relationship.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touches on the broader implications of these populist movements. McIlvenna suggests that the success of populism in Europe and the UK could be a precursor to Trump’s potential re-election in November.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“There is a great grand game for Nigel to play,” he says, drawing parallels between the populist victories in Europe and the anticipated outcomes in the US. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>“President Trump can have a connection with Europe that he did not have before,” McIlvenna asserts, suggesting that this alignment could lead to a more cohesive and influential populist bloc.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Peter McIlvenna Breaks Down What’s To Come Following UK’s Historic Election Results</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a fiery segment titled “It’s Hammer Time on the War Room,” Josh Hammer from Newsweek joined Ben Harnwell to discuss his recent article and dissect an appalling Lincoln Project advertisement targeting Steve Bannon in prison.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This is a highly, highly disreputable outfit. I think that would be a charitable way of saying it. I have far  less charitable, more colorful things to perhaps off camera about them.  They created this new advertisement. They are not just mocking Steve Bannon but essentially taunting him and saying that they hope that he gets raped in prison- if I understand the ad. I’m pretty sure that’s what they’re saying there. And you know, if there are any  boundaries or any sense of ethics or anything remotely approximating ethics when it comes to politics in the year 2024, This is over that line.  I would not wish my worst political enemies to be raped. I would never in a million years think that or -let alone produce a video to that effect against Nancy. Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, you name it—none of these people. There are some lines you do not cross and that is the whole point of being the news,” Hammer told Harnwell. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In the WarRoom segment, Hammer didn’t mince words, describing the Lincoln Project as a “disgusting outfit” filled with scandalous figures. He criticized their history, including allegations of pedophilia against John Weaver, a former member. The advertisement in question mocked Bannon and insinuated horrifying acts in prison, crossing a moral line that even political adversaries condemned.</p>\n<p>Hammer emphasized that the backlash against the Lincoln Project’s ad transcended partisan lines, with figures from both anti-Trump and pro-Trump camps denouncing it. He pointed out the hypocrisy of a supposedly progressive group resorting to such distasteful tactics while claiming moral superiority. Hammer expressed his disdain for the Lincoln Project’s actions, highlighting the broader consensus that the ad was not just offensive but morally bankrupt.</p>\n<p>The ad, which was immediately pinned to the top of the Twitter feed for  The Lincoln Project, has been unpinned but does not appear to have been removed after being up for three days.  Many people said that the video footage for their ad depicted Bannon being raped in prison, to the glee of the group members.</p>\n<p>Harnwell echoed Hammer’s sentiments, decrying the Lincoln Project’s lack of decency and accusing them of grifting off anti-Trump sentiment while displaying no moral high ground. They discussed the broader implications of such ads on political discourse, noting that the public backlash signaled a significant overstep by the Lincoln Project, damaging whatever credibility they might have claimed.</p>\n<p>Both speakers underscored that the ad’s graphic nature went beyond mere political rivalry, touching on fundamental ethical boundaries that should not be crossed in civilized discourse. They concluded that the Lincoln Project’s actions were repulsive and indicative of a deeper problem within contemporary political campaigning, where ethics are sacrificed for shock value and partisan gain.</p>\n<p>The controversy surrounding the Lincoln Project’s ad underscores ongoing ethical debates in political messaging and the condemnation of extreme tactics even within the adversarial landscape of American politics. This incident is a stark reminder of the dangers of descending into personal attacks and ethical compromises in pursuing political goals.</p>\n<p>Their critique highlights the broader implications of such tactics on public trust and political discourse. It reinforces the need for ethical standards in political campaigning and the responsibility of political actors to uphold decency and integrity in their communications.</p>\n<p>The fallout from the Lincoln Project’s ad targeting Steve Bannon reveals deeper tensions within contemporary political activism. It also reflects broader ethical debates about the boundaries of political discourse and the consequences of crossing them.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full interview with Josh Hammer:</p>\n<h1>Hammer’s Not Surprised Lincoln Project Promotes Rape Following Its Association With “Pedophilia”</h1>\n</div>\n"

As CISA summarizes:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>“Different regions of the United States increasingly find themselves threatened by either too much or too little water. In 2029, extreme weather has come to feel like the norm; the country is a patchwork of regions either inundated with floods and hurricanes or parched by drought and choked by wildfires. Three issues have exacerbated the challenges that jurisdictions face with water: (1) the growing effects of climate change; (2) aging water infrastructure; and (3) breakdowns in public trust. To date, efforts to address these issues have proven insufficient. Transitioning to clean energy, for example, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change has been hindered by slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles, challenges with workforce development and reskilling, and a failure for new materials and greener processes to be incorporated at scale. A more moderate future will require an immoderate effort to address these issues moving forward.”</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In a similarly styled political “Matrix <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Secure%20Tomorrow%20Series%20Placemats%20for%20Water%20Availability%20Matrix%20Game%20%28508%29.pdf\">Game</a>,” CISA officials detail looming acts threatening water security such as “demographic shifts,” “the presence of novel contaminants (e.g., pharmaceutical byproducts, perfluorinated compounds, nanoplastics),” and “competition over water resources.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>In another war-game exercise created by CISA, the agency predicts energy shortages as a result of transitions to green energy.</p>\n<p>The \"Day Z<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Secure%20Tomorrow%20Series%20Scenario%20Narrative%20%233%20Day%20Zero%20%28508%29_0.pdf\">ero” simulation </a>attempts to plan out how to best ration electricity and power:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The city of Monroe declared that it has less than six months of water supplies remaining and must make drastic cuts that will harshly impact both citizens and businesses. However, Monroe is just one of many cities in the United States facing a likely water crisis. There are many stresses on water systems, but an underappreciated one is the demand from the energy sector. As the United States pursues the clean energy transition (i.e., investing in alternative fuels, photovoltaics, electric batteries, etc., with the goal of reducing carbon emissions), demand for energy is increasing and, at least in the short term, this is causing increased dependence on traditional sources of energy. Energy production is a water-intensive process, as is the production of necessary equipment. The author of the scenario’s fictitious essay advocates for approaching water resources more holistically: examining demand and exploring solutions across jurisdictions (where they draw from the same water sources) and sectors, most critically the energy and agriculture sectors.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>These unearthed simulations come amidst CISA playing a leading role in election security for the 2024 election.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Nigel Farage, the outspoken populist and architect of Brexit, persisted and won a seat in the U.K. Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts. Leading the right-wing Reform UK party, Farage captured the Clacton seat, marking a pivotal moment in his political journey and signaling a broader populist surge that mainstream media largely ignored.</p>\n<p>\"My plan is to build a mass national movement over the course of the next few years and hopefully be big enough to challenge the general election properly in 2029,” Farage declared following his victory.</p>\n<p>The result highlights a surprisingly strong performance by Reform UK in the recent elections. Exit polls had predicted that the party might secure up to 13 seats, and ultimately, they captured four seats with approximately 14% of the vote share. Farage’s win is a testament to his perseverance and the growing influence of the populist movement in the U.K.</p>\n<p>Farage’s return to frontline politics has been nothing short of dramatic. Initially, he had decided not to stand as an MP in this election, opting instead to support former U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign. However, just last month, he made a sudden U-turn, rejoining Reform UK as its leader. This decision catalyzed a surge in the party’s popularity, drawing significant attention and support away from the ruling Conservatives.</p>\n<p>Farage is best known for his relentless campaign to see the U.K. leave the European Union. He initially led the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and later founded the Brexit Party, which eventually evolved into Reform UK. His euroskeptic and anti-immigration stance has consistently resonated with a segment of the British electorate disillusioned with traditional political parties.</p>\n<p>Carsten Nickel, managing director at U.S. corporate advisory firm Teneo, noted the broader impact of Farage’s success. “The overall U.K. result means Farage has really helped Labour,” Nickel said. “He has split the Conservative vote, so the massive losses we see on the Conservative side are, to a large degree, due to Nigel Farage stepping on the scene with his Reform party.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in the evening, Farage posted a defiant video on X (formerly Twitter), titled: \"The revolt against the establishment is underway.” He proclaimed, \"We’re going to win seats, many, many seats. Mainstream media are in denial, just as much as our political parties.”</p>\n<p>Farage’s victory is part of a broader populist movement sweeping across Europe. In France, a similar wave is anticipated as the nation heads to the polls this Sunday. This movement, characterized by a strong stance on immigration and a commitment to restoring national sovereignty, draws inspiration from global figures like President Donald Trump. Trump is widely seen as a foundational figure in the populist movement, advocating for policies that prioritize the interests of the common people and challenge the status quo.</p>\n<p>The populist surge reflects a growing concern among voters about unlawful migration and the perceived failures of established political parties to address these issues. Farage’s Reform UK, like its counterparts in other countries, promises to give voice to these concerns and restore trust in government by putting the interests of ordinary citizens first.</p>\n<p>As Farage embarks on his new role as an MP, his perseverance and political skills will undoubtedly continue to shape the discourse in the U.K. and beyond. His success not only highlights the resilience of his political strategy but also underscores the enduring appeal of populist ideals in a rapidly changing political landscape.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>France is gripped by escalating concerns over political violence as the country prepares for high-stakes parliamentary elections this weekend. A series of alarming incidents, including physical assaults on lawmakers, has underscored the tense atmosphere surrounding the electoral process.</p>\n<p>President Emmanuel Macron, taking a jab at Marine Le Pen, has issued stark warnings about the potential consequences of extreme political outcomes in these elections. He notably invoked the specter of “civil war” should the far-left or far-right achieve significant victories. Macron’s concerns reflect a broader anxiety within the political establishment regarding the polarizing impact of electoral outcomes amidst a charged societal climate.</p>\n<p>Le Pen took a jab back at Macron:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\"We represent no danger, except that of making Emmanuel Macron lose power,” Le Pen said to CNN News during an interview<a href=\"https://x.com/CNNFrancePR/status/1808987120213602463\"> to be aired</a> on Friday. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The parliamentary elections have already delivered surprising results in the first round, with RN emerging as the leading party.  Le Pen’s RN bloc secured a significant share of the vote, positioning them closely to the corridors of power. However, projections suggest they may fall short of the majority needed to govern outright, potentially leading to a hung parliament and heightened political uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her campaign team became victims of such violence while canvassing in the Parisian suburbs according to media reports from CNN. They were attacked by a group of youths when attempting to prevent the defacement of campaign posters. While Thevenot herself escaped physical harm, her deputy and a team member were hospitalized due to injuries sustained during the altercation.</p>\n<p>In response to the incident, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin confirmed that arrests had been made, signaling swift action against the perpetrators. Despite the attack, Thevenot expressed determination to continue campaigning, condemning violence as “never the answer.”</p>\n<p>The violence is not isolated, according to media reports. Marie Dauchy of the National Rally (RN) suspended her campaign after being physically assaulted while campaigning in Savoie. Similarly, Nicolas Conquer, a candidate from The Republican party, filed a formal complaint after allegedly being attacked by left-wing campaigners in Cherbourg.</p>\n<p>Jordan Bardella, leader of the National Rally party, acknowledged the rising political tensions and pledged to address security concerns if elected. “For several weeks now, we have seen a multiplication of violence in the streets linked to the electoral campaign,” Bardella remarked, emphasizing the need for calm and order.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal echoed similar sentiments, denouncing the attacks as incompatible with democratic values. He emphasized the imperative of rejecting violence and intimidation in political discourse, underscoring the government’s commitment to maintaining public order.</p>\n<p>The escalating violence has prompted a proactive response from French authorities. Ahead of Sunday’s runoff vote, an additional 30,000 police officers and gendarmes will be deployed across the country to prevent potential unrest and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. Interior Minister Darmanin emphasized the importance of preventing either extreme from exploiting the election results for inciting further violence.</p>\n<p>As France braces for a critical electoral moment, the specter of political violence casts a long shadow over the democratic process. The incidents of assault and intimidation underscore the stakes involved and the challenges facing France as it navigates through a contentious election cycle. The outcome on Sunday will not only determine the composition of the National Assembly but also shape the future trajectory of French politics amidst heightened polarization and societal divisions.</p>\n</div>\n"

The scale of Labour’s victory is astonishing, with projections suggesting the largest majority for the party since Tony Blair’s triumph in 1997. Such a result has sparked reactions from political commentators and party members alike, with some describing it as a “tsunami” rather than a mere landslide.</p>\n<p>Patrick McFadden, Labour’s General Election Coordinator, expressed his enthusiasm for the transformative potential of this victory, indicating a busy weekend ahead as the new government gears up to implement its agenda. The projected defeat of prominent Conservative figures such as Jeremy Hunt, Grant Shapps, Penny Mordaunt, Iain Duncan Smith, and Jacob Rees-Mogg adds to the shockwaves reverberating through the political landscape.</p>\n<p>Yet, amidst Labour’s triumph, another significant narrative is emerging: the unexpected success of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage. According to the exit polls, Reform UK is poised to secure 13 MPs, far exceeding expectations. This development represents a substantial advance for the party and marks a critical juncture in Farage’s ongoing political journey.</p>\n<p>Throughout the election campaign, Farage has been vocal about his ambitions for Reform UK. The potential election of 13 MPs provides a strong foundation for his five-year plan to reshape the right-wing political spectrum. Farage’s influence, often dubbed the “Farage Factor,” appears to have resonated with voters, contributing significantly to the party’s performance.</p>\n<p>Dixon underscores the significance of these results, particularly for the Conservative Party. With projections showing the Tories reduced to 131 MPs, this represents their lowest tally in modern political history. The party now faces an existential challenge, struggling to maintain its relevance and recover from this electoral blow.</p>\n<p>As the counting continues at various locations, including Clacton Leisure Centre, the atmosphere is charged with anticipation, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/GBNEWS/status/1808978882504147239\">GB News</a>. While the postal votes are being verified, the main votes are expected to be announced soon. Dixon notes the absence of Farage and other prominent candidates at this stage but highlights the positive feedback received by Reform UK activists during their campaign efforts.</p>\n<p>The success of Reform UK extends beyond Farage’s own candidacy. Key figures such as Richard Tice and Lee Anderson, who previously switched allegiance from the Conservatives to Reform UK, are also predicted to perform well. These developments underscore the broader appeal of the party and suggest a significant shift in the UK’s political dynamics.</p>\n<p>The UK election results are shaping up to be a night of surprises and significant changes. Labour’s projected landslide victory marks a dramatic shift in the political landscape, while Reform UK’s unexpected success heralds a new era for right-wing politics under Nigel Farage’s leadership. As the final results come in, all eyes remain on these emerging trends and their implications for the future of UK politics.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a pre-recorded Independence Day special of his WarRoom show, Steve Bannon, on the brink of his incarceration for defying Congress, offered a compelling commentary on America’s foundational conflicts and the distinctive American spirit. Speaking with author Patrick K. O’Donnell, Bannon delivered a two-hour interview rich with historical reflections and critical insights into the nation’s past and present.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon began by emphasizing the intensity and complexity of America’s early conflicts. “These were hard-fought kinetic wars, and you had debates and negotiations. You had all of that, but you must look at it because so many people have forgotten,” he said. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He reminded listeners that the Revolutionary and Civil Wars were determined on the battlefield, in political gatherings, and even in the British Commons.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the unique American spirit, Bannon quoted Benjamin Franklin: “Franklin said about Americans: ‘We’re not British anymore. We’ve created something here in this new experience. That’s different. It’s rougher. It’s got more grit.'” He highlighted that Americans fundamentally differ from their British ancestors, showcasing a resilience and tenacity forged through struggle and perseverance.</p>\n<p>Bannon stressed the importance of understanding the true struggles behind America’s foundation. “Look, I’d love the fact that you’re at the beach, you know, the Jaws movie was about the Fourth of July weekend. You’re going to baseball doubleheaders, hot dogs, the backyard barbecue, all of it, but so many people protecting the younger generation think, ‘Well, hey, they came out and, you know, negotiated this great thing and wrote this great document and spoke to all mankind.'” He underscored that the ideals of freedom and liberty that define America were hard-won and continue to shape the world.</p>\n<p>In his discussion, Bannon paid homage to historical figures such as Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, General Crook, and President Lincoln, noting their pivotal roles in shaping American history. He pointed to significant moments like the “American Thermopylae” in Brooklyn, where a small group’s defense allowed the Continental Army to survive a critical juncture. Bannon lamented the lack of recognition for these historical sites in Brooklyn and Manhattan, emphasizing the need for commemoration.</p>\n<p>Bannon made several critical points about American history and the Revolutionary War:</p>\n<p>Bravery and Sacrifice: Bannon emphasized the incredible bravery and sacrifice of the American Revolutionary War heroes, who faced the constant threat of hanging by the British. He highlighted their willingness to risk everything for the cause of freedom.</p>\n<p>Unmarked Graves: Bannon lamented that many of these heroic figures are buried in unmarked graves, with their exact locations often unknown or obscured by modern developments like parking lots or taverns in Brooklyn. This serves as a poignant reminder of their forgotten sacrifices.</p>\n<p>Overlooked Heroes: Bannon criticized the lack of recognition in popular culture for these lesser-known heroes of the Revolution, apart from figures like Washington and other notable leaders.</p>\n<p>During his discussion with O’Donnell, Bannon underscored the gravity of the debates among the American patriots. “This was about life or death. They were talking about an imperial power that had the finest Navy and a professional army,” he stated. He highlighted the British response with a massive expeditionary force, including Hessians, aimed at quashing the rebellion: “They sent over the most massive expeditionary force in mankind’s history at that time.”</p>\n<p>Bannon discussed British tactics, drawing parallels to their responses in Ireland and their harsh measures like collective punishment: “They had collective punishments like the Boston Port Act, closing the port and throwing thousands out of work.” He underscored the escalating tensions leading up to the Revolution and the colonial response to British actions: “Each British action further alienated the colonies and escalated the conflict.”</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon contextualized the Revolutionary War as a military conflict and a political struggle: “The Revolution wasn’t just fought on the battlefield but in political gatherings and debates.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He portrayed the American Revolution as a pivotal moment in history, where negotiation was insufficient in the face of British oppression, necessitating a fight for liberty and independence through military means.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s reflections delve into the foundational ethos of American history, emphasizing that the nation’s achievements and values have been hard-won through perseverance and sacrifice. He expressed disappointment in the lack of commemoration for lesser-known but vital events in American history, suggesting a need to elevate awareness and appreciation for these historic battlegrounds.</p>\n<p>Throughout his remarks, Bannon emphasized the ongoing relevance of these historical lessons, urging his audience to remember and honor the grit and determination of past generations. He extended this sentiment to contemporary challenges, urging resilience and a refusal to quit in the face of adversity, echoing the spirit encapsulated in the “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfuLrny00t4\">Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>,” which celebrates endurance and steadfastness in pursuit of freedom and justice.</p>\n<p>Bannon also recommended cultural and educational resources to deepen the understanding of American history. He suggested watching the series “John Adams” to grasp the intensity and educational value of historical debates and events. He mentioned Patrick K. O’Donnell’s books as essential for understanding American combat history, noting that they are informative yet engaging as they read like novels. Additionally, he referenced “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” as one of his favorite songs, emphasizing its significance in American history and its theme of perseverance and sacrifice.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>A critical quote from Bannon encapsulates the theme of sacrifice and perseverance in American history: “Anything of value in this country has not been handed to people. It’s been fought for.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This statement underscores his belief in the hard-won nature of American achievements and the importance of recognizing historical sacrifices.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s reflections on American history and spirit serve as a powerful reminder of the nation’s enduring values and the struggles that have shaped its identity. His emphasis on bravery, sacrifice, and resilience provides a compelling narrative that urges contemporary Americans to honor and uphold the legacy of their forebears.</p>\n<p>For more context, read <a href=\"https://warroom.org/bannons-warroom-show-clip-roundup-7-4-2024-saturday/\">Thursday’s show notes</a> and watch the full program:</p>\n<h1>Episode 3732: WarRoom Independence Day Special</h1>\n<h1>Episode 3733: WarRoom Independence Day special</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Mike Benz delivered a robust critique of the current political landscape, focusing particularly on President Joe Biden’s fitness for office, the influence of the intelligence community, and the broader implications for national security and foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Benz begins by discussing the uncertainty surrounding President Joe Biden’s political future, particularly his ability to remain in the presidential race. He metaphorically describes the political establishment’s search for a new leader: “The parasite is looking for a new host body.” Benz argues that Biden has been a long-serving member of the Washington power structure, often referred to as the “blob,” which includes the war industry, statecraft instruments, and intelligence community. These entities, he says, are looking for a new leader because they perceive Biden’s weakening condition as a liability.</p>\n<p>Benz highlights Biden’s long history within this establishment, stating, “Joe Biden has been a faithful servant for over 40 years to that blob class.” He emphasizes that Biden’s perceived frailty and his nickname “Mr. Foreign Policy” are now sources of concern. The intelligence community’s silence on Biden’s cognitive abilities is particularly striking to Benz, who points out, “The commander-in-chief cannot keep his eyes open past 4 PM, and when the clock strikes about nine or ten, he turns into effectively a total vegetable.”</p>\n<p>Benz underscores the critical role of a cogent president in handling national security emergencies. He questions Biden’s ability to make timely decisions: “National Security emergencies happen every week in some country, in somewhere, there are issues of grave concern to the CIA, to the Pentagon, to the State Department.” He stresses that Biden’s incapacities could compromise America’s ability to respond effectively to such crises.</p>\n<p>According to Benz, the Democratic Party faces a significant challenge in finding a suitable replacement for Biden. He believes that many potential candidates lack the necessary foreign policy experience: “The Democrat Party has a lot of folks who are focused on domestic priorities… and who are simply not as well-versed in the secrets of the American Empire.” He mentions Kamala Harris as a potential candidate but notes her relative inexperience compared to Biden. He also suggests that Hillary Clinton could be a suitable replacement due to her extensive knowledge of foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Benz told show host Natalie Winters, that he finds it fascinating that Hunter Biden is now involved in high-level White House meetings. This involvement contradicts previous claims that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden’s activities were separate. Benz states, “Hunter Biden is effectively acting as his proxy, teleporting into the West Wing to directly participate in essentially presidential matters.” He views Hunter Biden’s involvement as an extension of his father’s deep ties to the intelligence community and foreign dealings.</p>\n<p>Benz also highlights the influence of Mike Donilon, a long-time advisor to Joe Biden, whose brother Tom Donilon is the chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. Benz argues that this relationship underscores the intricate connections between political, intelligence, and financial institutions in the U.S. He describes Biden as a “BlackRock president” serving both corporate and intelligence interests.</p>\n<p>Benz turned his attention to USAID, describing it as a “CIA front” rather than a mere charity organization. He recounts various instances where USAID has been involved in covert operations, such as creating a Twitter knockoff app in Cuba to incite revolt and running fake aid clinics in Colombia and Venezuela for paramilitary activities. Benz emphasizes that USAID’s inclusion in the National Security Council solidifies its role in shaping U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Benz’s commentary paints a picture of a political and intelligence landscape fraught with complex relationships and hidden agendas. He raises critical questions about Joe Biden’s capacity to lead and the broader implications for U.S. national security. Benz’s analysis suggests that searching for a new leader within the Democratic Party is not just a political maneuver but a strategic necessity for maintaining the current power structure.</p>\n<p>For more Context watch Benz’s full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Benz: Parasitic “Blob” Class Now Looking For New Host Body</h1>\n<p>Mike Benz is a commentator known for his critical analysis of U.S. politics, national security, and foreign policy.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and prominent attorney for Donald Trump, has been disbarred in New York amid allegations that he played a significant role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. A New York appeals court revoked Giuliani’s New York law license, citing dissemination of false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers, and the public in his capacity as Trump’s lawyer. His law license remains under review in Washington, D.C., as well.</p>\n<p>Giuliani <a href=\"https://x.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1808178653479817701\">responded</a> to the disbarment with a strongly worded statement, accusing the judicial system of being politically biased.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I’m not surprised that I’ve been disbarred by a Bar Ass’n which is a politically and ideologically integral part of the Democrat one party corrupted court system for a long time,” Giuliani posted on his social media. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>He criticized Democrats judges in New York City, likening their selection process to that of a “one party Communist dictatorship” where judges are “selected by local Democrat bosses” and often run unopposed.</p>\n<p>His full statement:</p>\n<p>“I’m not surprised that I’ve been disbarred by a Bar Ass’n which is a politically and ideologically integral part of the Democrat one party corrupted court system for a long time. Judges, like Merchan and Engoron in NYC are selected by local Democrat bosses. These judges, just like in a one party Communist dictatorship, are not really elected but selected by the Democrat local bosses and often run unopposed. The case is based on an activist complaint, replete with false arguments, a hearing officer who was a former judge from the same corrupt Democrat selection process, and a tape with almost 1/4th of the most critical parts erased and covered up by either the Chief NY Bar \"persecutor” and his staff, or the Sec’y of State of Georgia.”</p>\n<p>The disbarment adds to Giuliani’s mounting legal troubles. In December, he filed for bankruptcy protection after being ordered to pay $148 million in a defamation case involving two Georgia election workers. The court, <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/judge-orders-default-judgment-sanctions-against-rudy-giuliani-in-election-workers-lawsuit/ar-AA1fZR9o?ocid=BingNewsVerp\">which denied Guiliani the opportunity to defend himself</a>, found that Giuliani had falsely accused these workers of committing ballot fraud, one of many claims he made in an attempt to support Trump’s bid to invalidate the election results.</p>\n<p>Giuliani’s lawyer, Barry Kamins, expressed disappointment in the court’s decision and indicated they are considering their appellate options.</p>\n<p>The New York appeals court’s decision detailed several instances of what Giuliani said were false statements. Among them were claims of endemic election fraud in Philadelphia, ballots being smuggled from Long Island, thousands of non-U.S. citizens voting in Arizona, and Dominion Voting Systems machines being manipulated in Georgia.</p>\n<p>Giuliani, a Republican, who has been admitted to practice law in New York since 1969, now faces the prospect of continuing his legal battles without the ability to practice law in his home state. His disbarment marks a significant attack on a man who once served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and was celebrated for his leadership during the September 11 attacks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Picture shows the ‘Pizza Connection’ Mafia-<a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/pizza-connection\"> Link</a>)</p>\n<p>In addition to his more recent controversial activities, Giuliani’s career was marked by notable achievements, including his role as the lead prosecutor in dismantling the mob in the 1980s. He led the prosecution in the famous <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-pizza-connection-35th-anniversary-040519\">“Pizza Connection”</a> case, which was dubbed by the media at the time. The case involved a massive heroin and cocaine trafficking operation run by the Sicilian Mafia in the United States and Italy, and it resulted in significant convictions that helped cripple organized crime.</p>\n<p>Despite his disbarment and ongoing legal challenges, Giuliani remains a vocal supporter of Trump and continues to defend his actions related to the 2020 election. His statement in response to the disbarment underscores his belief that he is a victim of a politically motivated judicial system, a narrative he has frequently employed in his defense.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Mike Davis’s remarks in the WarRoom on Wednesday, with host Ben Harnwell, underscored a pivotal strategy in the upcoming political landscape: the role of Super PACs in influencing electoral outcomes amidst shifting dynamics and loss of public support within the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>Davis emphasized the critical impact of financial resources controlled by Super PACs, highlighting their potential to sway elections and shape the narrative surrounding candidates.</p>\n<p>Super PACs, which can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, and individuals, play a significant role in modern American politics. Davis pointed out that these entities are poised to play a crucial role in the upcoming election cycle, particularly as the Democratic Party grapples with internal discord and strategic uncertainties after Biden’s horrible performance at the Presidential debate last week.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The infusion of Super PAC money into campaigns has become a defining feature of contemporary political strategy,” Davis noted. “It allows candidates to amplify their messaging, counter opposition attacks, and mobilize voter support on a scale that traditional campaign finance limitations would otherwise restrict.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Davis’s analysis echoed broader concerns about the influence of money in politics, particularly its potential to undermine democratic principles. Critics argue that the unchecked flow of Super PAC funds can distort electoral processes, favoring candidates who are able to amass significant financial backing over those who rely on grassroots support or public funding mechanisms.</p>\n<p>“In an era where financial resources often dictate political viability,” Davis remarked, “Super PACs wield considerable influence, shaping the contours of electoral campaigns and influencing voter perceptions.”</p>\n<p>The discussion highlighted ongoing debates about campaign finance reform and the role of money in politics. While proponents of Super PACs argue that they promote free speech and bolster competitive elections, detractors argue that they amplify the voices of wealthy donors at the expense of broader democratic participation.</p>\n<p>“The challenge,” Davis emphasized, “lies in striking a balance between allowing for robust political discourse and safeguarding the integrity of electoral processes from undue financial influence.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Davis suggested that the 2024 elections could serve as a litmus test for the evolving role of Super PACs within the Democratic Party. With internal divisions and strategic recalibrations underway, the deployment of Super PAC resources may become increasingly pivotal in determining the party’s electoral fortunes and policy agendas.</p>\n<p>“As Democrats navigate internal fissures and external challenges,” Davis concluded, “the strategic deployment of Super PAC money will likely emerge as a critical factor in shaping the political landscape leading up to the 2024 elections.”</p>\n<p>Davis’s insights underscored the complex interplay between money, power, and political strategy in contemporary American politics. As Super PACs continue to redefine the contours of electoral competition, their influence is poised to remain a central point of contention and scrutiny in the broader discourse on democratic governance and electoral integrity.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch:</p>\n<h1>Davis: “[If You Thought] BLM And ANTIFA Riots Were Bad In 2020, Wait For The Hamas Riots In 2024”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Wednesday segment of the WarRoom program, acting host Ben Harnwell and Breitbart News Editor Matt Boyle discussed the internal turmoil within the Democratic Party since the Presidential debate last week. They highlighted the challenges the party faces with ailing Joe Biden’s candidacy and the looming threat for Democrats of a Donald Trump landslide victory.</p>\n<p>Boyle emphasized that the Democrats are starting to realize that holding onto the White House is increasingly unlikely. He cited a leak from Biden’s super PAC revealing internal polling data that showed Trump leading significantly in key battleground states even before the debate.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“According to Democrats’ own internal numbers, Trump was winning in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan before the debate, and then after the debate, he’s blown that wide open,” Boyle noted.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Boyle, this data suggests that Trump is not just on track for a win but a mandate, potentially securing over 330 electoral votes.</p>\n<p>Boyle explained that the Democrats are now fiercely debating whether Joe Biden or Kamala Harris would be a better candidate to minimize their losses in the Senate. “They are going to lose the U.S Senate majority,” Boyle asserted. He outlined the competitive Senate races in states like Ohio, Montana, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, indicating a tough road ahead for the Democrats. The party’s strategy appears focused on damage control, aiming to reduce the extent of their losses to better position themselves for future elections.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the New York Times article suggesting Biden is considering continuing the race. Boyle remarked on the internal strife this has caused within the party, with factions debating who between Biden and Harris could better stem the losses in down-ticket races. “It’s all about the down ticket, and it’s all about power. It’s all about control. It’s all about the long game in Washington D.C.,” Boyle emphasized.</p>\n<p>Boyle also mentioned how some Democratic donors are shifting their contributions away from the presidential race to focus on Senate and House campaigns. This strategic pivot underscores the party’s acceptance of the difficult path ahead and their efforts to maintain influence in Congress. Boyle stated, “The smarter Democrat donors are already moving their money into the low, the down-ticket races.”</p>\n<p>Boyle dispelled the notion of a coordinated effort to sabotage Biden, suggesting instead that the party had deluded itself into believing Biden could turn things around.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“They actually believed their own BS,” Boyle said, highlighting how the debate performance starkly contrasted the party’s expectations.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Looking forward, Boyle emphasized the importance of Trump’s running mate selection and how it could impact his agenda if he wins. He noted that various names are being considered, from establishment figures like Glenn Youngkin to more America First candidates like JD Vance. “This is a incredibly important moment for our country and the future of it,” Boyle stressed.</p>\n<p>Overall, Boyle painted a grim picture for the Democrats, who are grappling with internal divisions and a bleak electoral outlook. Their focus has shifted to minimizing losses and preparing for a potential Trump presidency. The stakes are high, and the decisions made in the coming weeks could shape the political landscape for years to come.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment featuring Matt Boyle:</p>\n<h1>Matthew Boyle: Biden’s Own Super PAC Polling Revealed President Trump Landslide “BEFORE The Debate”</h1>\n</div>\n"

Frankly, a great week for the country,” Jordan said,  highlighting the positive view of the recent events that he believes are beneficial.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jordan began by noting the recent successes of the Trump administration, highlighting a strong debate performance by the former president and favorable decisions by the Supreme Court. He specifically mentioned rulings on Chevron deference, the Fisher case, and a decision on immunity for President Trump. These developments, according to Jordan, have contributed to a delay in Trump’s sentencing, which he views positively.</p>\n<p>The conversation then shifted to the legal challenges against Trump, which Jordan characterized as politically motivated. He criticized the cases brought by Alvin Bragg and Jack Smith, accusing them of mishandling evidence and targeting Trump for political reasons. Jordan expressed frustration over Trump’s treatment compared to other political figures, pointing out the jailing of Trump allies like Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Navarro.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“All four of these cases were baloney,” Jordan said expressing his opinion that the legal cases against Trump are baseless and politically motivated.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jordan emphasized the need for Republicans to oppose these legal actions, citing the House’s efforts to subpoena individuals like Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino. He also praised Speaker Mike Johnson for criticizing the House Select Committee on January 6 as improperly constructed, noting that it lacked real cross-examination and was one-sided.</p>\n<p>The discussion also touched on broader political messaging. Jordan argued that the Republican message should focus on issues like border security, economic stability, and foreign policy strength, contrasting it with what he perceives as the failures of the Biden administration. He criticized the weaponization of government agencies against the American people called for a strong Republican message to counter these trends, and told Brat that he had overseen the issuance of 98 subpoenas.</p>\n<p>Jordan discussed how the House Judiciary Committee sued Attorney General Merrick Garland to obtain the audio tapes of Robert Hur’s interview with Joe Biden to enforce their subpoena.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Audio-subpoena-as-filed-complaint.pdf\">READ THE LAWSUIT: Audio subpoena as-filed complaint</a></p>\n<p>For more context, watch the entire segment with Jim Jordan:</p>\n<h1>“We’ve Got To Pushback Every Way Possible”: Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In the recent conversation on “The War Room,” Jeff Clark and Dave Brat discussed significant legal and political developments, particularly the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity and its implications for the January 6th investigations.</p>\n<p>Clark emphasized the importance of reading the 119-page Supreme Court opinion during his discussion.</p>\n<p>He urged listeners to undertake this task as a constitutional duty, suggesting that understanding the court’s reasoning firsthand was crucial amidst widespread misinformation and media misrepresentation of the ruling’s implications.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Look, we have a long set of opinions, a total of 119 pages. But you know, for anyone in the War Room audience, it’s easy. They should read it, if they can. That’s what I would task them with, it’s their constitutional duty, and they’re not going to find this insanity in the pages of the actual majority opinion by Chief Justice Roberts,” Clark told Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>HERE IT IS- READ IT: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/scotus_immunity-7-1.pdf\">READ: scotus_immunity-7-1</a></strong></p>\n<p>Clark began his remarks by addressing what he perceived as a critical moment in legal history, likening the Supreme Court’s decision to “the shot heard around the world” for the Deep State and administrative apparatus. He emphasized that the ruling clarified the president’s authority under Article 2 of the Constitution to investigate and prosecute as necessary, countering what he described as a previously cozy setup within the Justice Department dominated by career officials favoring Democrats.</p>\n<p>Clark criticized the media’s response to the ruling, accusing them of misrepresenting its implications and fabricating scenarios like the Seal Team 6 hypothetical to discredit the decision. He argued that such misinformation aimed to undermine the Constitution’s principles rather than uphold them, challenging citizens to read the court’s opinion and fulfill their “constitutional duty” to understand its true meaning.</p>\n<p>Regarding the specifics of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Clark detailed that it affirmed civil and absolute criminal immunity for the president concerning core constitutional and delegated powers. He stressed that this was not a new law but a reaffirmation of constitutional principles often neglected in recent decades, particularly during what he termed as periods of post-constitutionalism dating back to the Progressive Era.</p>\n<p>Central to the discussion was the “take care clause,” found in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which mandates that the President must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Clark underscored that this duty is fundamental to the separation of powers and ensures that the President acts within the legal framework established by the Constitution and Congress.</p>\n<p>The conversation pivoted to the January 6th committee’s efforts to scrutinize President Trump’s actions on that day. Clark defended Trump’s speech as an official act protected under the Supreme Court’s framework. He dismissed attempts to categorize it as unofficial campaigning, asserting it was a legitimate exercise of presidential duties to address public concerns peacefully and patriotically.</p>\n<p>Clark encouraged listeners to engage politically through organizations like Citizens for Renewing America, advocating for actions that uphold constitutional principles amidst what he portrayed as ongoing challenges to constitutional governance.</p>\n<p>Clark’s analysis on “The War Room” underscored his belief in defending presidential authority, challenging media narratives, and fostering public engagement in constitutional matters amidst contemporary political controversies.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Clark: Mainstream Media Meltdown On Immunity Decision From SCOTUS</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent WarRoom episode, Steve Bannon welcomed US Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) to discuss pressing political issues, including the Supreme Court’s decision on immunity for official acts and its potential impact on President Trump’s actions on January 6th. Senator Paul emphasized that the kind of conversation happening on the WarRoom platform is exactly what the American people need to hear, underscoring the importance of open, candid discussions about government accountability and constitutional principles.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“What we need are more conversations like this one here on WarRoom,” Sen. Rand Paul told Steve Bannon. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Paul while emphasizing the importance of having candid and open conversations on platforms like WarRoom,  argued that mainstream media often fails to hold influential figures accountable, leaving a gap that independent platforms like WarRoom can fill. He believes these conversations are vital for fostering a more transparent and responsible government, allowing Americans to hear detailed and uncensored discussions about critical political issues.</p>\n<p>Paul and Bannon aim to empower their audience with knowledge and encourage a more active and informed citizenry through these dialogues.</p>\n<p>Bannon began the interaction by asking Senator Paul for his thoughts on the Supreme Court’s recent ruling regarding immunity for official acts. Paul expressed cautious optimism, noting that the decision was a positive step forward. However, he highlighted a crucial question: whether President Trump’s speech on January 6th would be considered an official act and thus protected by immunity. He acknowledged that this determination would likely be sent back to the lower courts to decide, emphasizing the complexity of distinguishing between official duties and political or partisan activities.</p>\n<p>Paul elaborated on the intricacies of defining official acts, drawing parallels with his own experiences as a senator. He explained that his speeches to the public, whether on the radio or other platforms, are part of his official duties. Similarly, he argued that presidential speeches, including those made by Trump on January 6th, should be considered official acts. This perspective is crucial because it frames Trump’s actions as part of his constitutional responsibilities, potentially granting him immunity from prosecution for those actions.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the broader implications of the Supreme Court’s decisions, including the recent overturn of Chevron deference.  Bannon described this as a monumental step in curbing the administrative state’s power, likening it to dismantling a “Leviathan.” He urged businesses beleaguered by excessive regulations to challenge these in court now that the precedent favoring government interpretation of ambiguous laws has been overturned. The shift, Paul argued, restores a presumption of liberty and individual rights, as originally intended by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Transitioning to another critical topic, Bannon and  Paul discussed Dr. Anthony Fauci and the origins of COVID-19.  Paul, drawing from his medical background, criticized Fauci for denying involvement in gain-of-function research and for misleading the public. He detailed his own investigative efforts, including his book “Deception: The Great COVID Cover-Up,” which aims to expose the truth about the pandemic’s origins and Fauci’s role. Paul accused Fauci of lying to Congress and called for greater oversight and accountability in biomedical research.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full segment: <a href=\"https://gettr.com/post/p37vzs5ae08\">LINK</a></p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Throughout history, individuals have faced imprisonment for daring to challenge political powers, spanning ancient civilizations to modern democracies and authoritarian regimes. Host of the WarRoom program and historian Steve Bannon has inspired the WarRoom audience with tales from all of these eras.</p>\n<p>July 1st, Bannon reports to prison.</p>\n<h1>Federal Inmate Number 05635-509 Stephen K. Bannon</h1>\n<p>His message is simple civic engagement must increase, and people need to vote:</p>\n<h1>Bannon – This Won’t Stop Unless You Stop It</h1>\n<p>WarRoom audiences have seen the clips and heard the citations from works about ancient Rome and Greece, figures like Socrates who paid with their lives for questioning rulers, setting early precedents for dissent and punishment. Medieval Europe saw heretics and political dissidents imprisoned for opposing monarchies and religious orthodoxy, illustrating the suppression of differing beliefs. Colonial struggles for independence, exemplified by Gandhi in India and Mandela in South Africa, involved imprisonment under colonial rule, highlighting resistance against foreign domination.</p>\n<p>Totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia used imprisonment and labor camps to crush dissent, demonstrating the brutal consequences of opposing state ideologies. The Cold War era witnessed widespread incarceration of dissidents in communist states, where speaking out against the regime meant risking imprisonment or worse. Today, in countries like China and Iran, activists and journalists are imprisoned for challenging state authority, underscoring ongoing global debates on human rights and freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the narrative of political imprisonment traces back through pivotal moments in its history, revealing a complex interplay between civil liberties and national security. During the early colonial era, figures like John Peter Zenger were jailed for criticizing British rule, laying foundational arguments for freedom of the press. The American Revolution saw the detention of loyalists and suspected British sympathizers, reflecting the wartime crackdown on perceived threats.</p>\n<p>The Civil War era witnessed arrests of anti-war activists, while World War I led to imprisonment under the Espionage and Sedition Acts, targeting war critics and socialists. The Red Scare of the 1920s and the McCarthy era in the 1950s resulted in the incarceration of alleged communists and anarchists fueled by fears of internal subversion. The Civil Rights Movement brought imprisonment for activists like Martin Luther King Jr., who challenged segregation and racial injustice, highlighting systemic resistance to civil rights advances.</p>\n<p>In more recent times, post-9/11 security measures led to the detention of individuals without trial under suspicion of terrorism, raising concerns about due process and civil liberties, and January 6th saw people being detained for years before giving them a trial. Amidst this historical backdrop, political imprisonment has resurfaced in contemporary American discourse, notably within the context of the MAGA movement.</p>\n<p>Recently, figures like Steve Bannon, hosting the WarRoom program, have framed their legal troubles as acts of political persecution by the Biden administration. In a fiery gathering with Charlie Kirk, Jack Posobiec, and U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Bannon defiantly declared their stance against what they perceived as coordinated efforts to undermine their movement.</p>\n<p>Kirk predicted their movement is impactful and will grow to be even more:</p>\n<h1>Charlie Kirk- They Will Write About This Movement for the Next Millennium</h1>\n<p>“This is the primal scream of a dying regime,” Bannon asserted, embodying the group’s combative rhetoric against perceived traitors like Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. The discourse emphasized their belief in a global pushback against established political systems, citing recent electoral successes in Europe as evidence of their growing international influence.</p>\n<p>Posobiec shared his thoughts:</p>\n<h1>Jack Posobiec – The Emperor Has No Clothes</h1>\n<p>Greene aligned herself with Bannon’s defiance, criticizing the Democratic Party and the January 6th Committee’s investigations as illegitimate and failures. She urged Republican colleagues to take bold actions against what she portrayed as a corrupt Democratic regime, echoing sentiments of widespread political persecution.</p>\n<h1>MTG – During War You Don’t Stay Home</h1>\n<p>Project 42, an initiative discussed by Bannon, Kirk, and Posobiec, underscores their strategic efforts to register 42,000 new voters in key states like Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. They advocate direct engagement, including wearing MAGA hats to initiate conversations about voter registration and political participation, reflecting a proactive approach to shaping electoral outcomes.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the dialogue among Bannon, Kirk, Posobiec, and Greene exemplifies a modern resistance movement against perceived political persecution, combining historical narratives of dissent with contemporary strategies for mobilization and electoral influence. Their rhetoric reflects ongoing debates on civil liberties, governmental authority, and the enduring struggle for political freedom in the United States and beyond.</p>\n<p>For more context watch the entire program:</p>\n<h1>WarRoom Special Broadcast: Next Man Up</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Steve Bannon, champion of the American working class men and women, the influential political strategist and former advisor to President Donald J. Trump, is the founder and host of the WarRoom. On the eve of entering federal prison for a four-month term, he sat down with Jonathan Karl on ABC News. The interview, fraught with tension, with Bannon’s defiance to surrender to Washington DC’s- “Group-Think” and Karl’s persistent challenges, aimed to unpack Bannon’s controversial patriotic views and impending incarceration.</p>\n<p>Bannon, known for his unyielding advocacy of the America First agenda, and he terms it the “Populist-Nationalist revolution,” used the platform to reiterate his vision of reshaping the U.S. government according to US Constitutional principles.</p>\n<p>Despite Karl’s attempts to marginalize him by highlighting MAGA’s losses, Bannon managed to convey his message:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This is a populist-nationalist revolution. It’s a process. We’re not going to win every election,” Bannon said, responding to Karl’s bait. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon’s journey from the heights of political power as Trump’s 2016 chief strategist to facing federal prison months ahead of Trump’s 2024 election exemplifies the tumultuous intersection of ideology, power, and weaponized lawfare.</p>\n<p>Bannon’s assertion in numerous public appearances that he and MAGA operate in a movement akin to historical figures like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln underscores the gravity with which he views his mission for the WarRoom program:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“No other men in the history of this Republic, General Washington and the revolution, and the foundation and Abraham Lincoln in his Civil War, had the personal fate and destiny tied to an individual like this,” Bannon has said, pointing to the ideas of President Trump. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the interview, Karl confronted Bannon about his provocative statements and legal troubles. Bannon staunchly defended his actions, conveying that he has positioned himself as a patriot of political persecution rather than a criminal:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I consider myself a political prisoner. I’m proud of what we’ve done. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished,” Bannon told Karl. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The discussion pivoted to Bannon’s role in Trump’s campaigns and his current advocacy for investigating alleged misconduct by political opponents. Bannon insisted that his calls for justice should not be conflated with calls for retribution:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We’re not talking about retribution. We’re talking about justice,” Bannon said. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Karl challenged Bannon on statements where he appeared to endorse severe actions against public figures like Anthony Fauci and Christopher Wray. Bannon clarified these remarks as metaphorical expressions aimed at galvanizing support rather than advocating violence:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s a metaphor. It’s beneath you to bring it up in this way,” Bannon answered.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon’s defiant tone reflected his belief that his rhetoric, however controversial, resonates with a significant segment of the American public disillusioned with establishment politics. His predictions of electoral victories and plans under “<a href=\"https://www.project2025.org/\">Project 2025</a>,” aimed at reshaping the government, underscored his ongoing influence within populist circles:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I believe in this program. I believe in what it stands for,”Bannon replied. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The interview also delved into Bannon’s views on the integrity of the 2020 election, a contentious topic that has divided the nation. Bannon’s insistence that widespread belief in election illegitimacy justified further investigation highlighted his role as a provocateur and ideologue:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Over 50 percent of the American people right now, including 80 of Republicans, believe the 2020 election is illegitimate,” Bannon cited.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>As Bannon faced the prospect of imprisonment, Karl pressed him on the implications of his legal battle and its impact on his political ambitions. Bannon remained steadfast, viewing his legal troubles as part of a broader struggle against entrenched interests:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“This is a fight. This is going to be won or lost in the trenches,”  he said. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the adversarial nature of the interview, Bannon managed to convey his message to ABC’s audience, reinforcing his influence as a voice for disenfranchised Americans, conservatives, democrats, liberals and nationalists.</p>\n<p>His parting words reflected his unwavering commitment to his cause:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“I’m not backing off my tone,” Bannon said defiantly. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bannon’s interview with  Karl on ABC News showcased a man unapologetic for his beliefs and actions, facing a pivotal moment in his career. Bannon’s defiance, mixed with his strategic vision for political change, highlighted the enduring impact of his populist-nationalist ideology on American politics.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch:</p>\n<h1>ABC Sunday Exclusive: This Week One-On-One with Steve Bannon</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://rumble.com/v54nswl-abc-sunday-exclusive-this-week-one-on-one-with-steve-bannon.html\">LINK</a></p>\n<p>Watch the WarRoom Monday through Saturday on <a href=\"https://rumble.com/user/RealAmericasVoice\">Real America’s Voice</a>, 10 am to Noon Eastern Time.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a recent WarRoom discussion, Steve Bannon and Jim Rickards analyzed the current state of American politics and the implications of President Biden’s cognitive decline on national security and the political landscape, and they talked about the consequences of Thursday’s disastrous debate.</p>\n<p>Rickards is a frequent WarRoom guest and<a href=\"https://warroom.org/bidens-irs-is-watching-you/\"> contributor</a>, an American lawyer, economist, investment banker, and author known for his expertise in financial markets and geopolitical events. He advises governmental and financial institutions and is a prominent commentator on global economics and monetary policies. Rickards has authored influential books such as “Currency Wars,” “The Death of Money,” and “The Road to Ruin,” discussing currency wars, financial crises, and the global economic system’s vulnerabilities. He frequently appears on financial news programs and writes for various publications, offering deep insights into economic instability and wealth preservation.</p>\n<p>Rickards began his Friday WarRoom appearance by highlighting the unchanged perception of President Biden over the past four years, describing him as being in cognitive decline, potentially suffering from some stage of dementia. He stressed that dementia is a progressive disease, implying Biden’s condition has likely worsened. Rickards noted that Biden’s recent appearances suggest he is being heavily medicated, which impacts his appearance and demeanor.</p>\n<p>Rickards referenced Marshall McLuhan’s idea that “the medium is the message,” explaining that people often judge television personalities based on their visual and auditory presentation rather than their spoken content. He emphasized that Biden’s visual presentation during debates was particularly concerning, with his physical appearance potentially undermining his credibility and capability in the eyes of viewers.</p>\n<p>Rickards praised President Trump for his sharp and strategic debate performance, likening him to a “ninja” for his ability to pivot topics effectively. He highlighted Trump’s ability to connect issues like immigration to broader concerns affecting African Americans and Hispanics, thus strengthening his appeal to these demographics. Rickards also commended Trump’s use of memorable phrases like “Manchurian candidate,” which succinctly conveyed complex accusations without delving into extensive details that might lose the audience.</p>\n<p>Rickards expressed grave concerns about national security, given Biden’s cognitive state. He referenced Annie Jacobson’s book on nuclear war to illustrate the gravity of decision-making required in such scenarios. He argued that Biden, given his mental state, would likely be deemed incompetent to manage such critical responsibilities if he were not president. Rickards suggested that if Biden were a private citizen, his family might seek a legal guardian to manage his affairs.</p>\n<p>The conversation shifted to the broader implications of the current political situation. Rickards pointed out that adversaries like China and Russia likely view the U.S. as weakened under Biden’s administration. He argued that the U.S. should seek strategic alliances, particularly with Russia, to counter the growing threat from China. Rickards emphasized that the greatest enemy of the U.S. is not external but internal, citing deep-seated political divisions and failures within the government.</p>\n<p>Rickards criticized the judicial system for being complicit in what he described as the politicization of justice, particularly in the context of January 6th prosecutions. He cited the recent Supreme Court decision overturning wrongful prosecutions of defendants on January 6th as a rare victory for justice. Still, he lamented the broader failure of the judiciary to stand up to political pressures.</p>\n<p>The discussion concluded with a focus on the potential strategies the Democratic Party might employ to navigate the political landscape, given Biden’s vulnerabilities. Rickards speculated on the possibility of significant legal and political maneuvers, including using the 14th Amendment to challenge Trump’s eligibility to run for office. He stressed that these ongoing legal battles are part of a broader strategy to undermine Trump’s political viability.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the full WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Rickards: Biden Would Have Family-Appointed “Guardian” If He Didn’t Occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue</h1>\n</div>\n"

Their conversation into the critical legal filings aimed at safeguarding election accuracy highlighted election integrity tactics and grassroots organizing as pivotal strategies for the America First movement.</p>\n<p>Castor, known for being one of President Trump’s impeachment lawyers, opened the discussion by raising alarms about the reliability of election processes in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s not necessarily voter fraud,” Castor clarified, “but rather a failure to meet the minimal touchstones required by Congress to ensure election reliability.” </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Castor emphasized filing federal court actions over state and federal Civil Rights violations to address these concerns, fearing similar issues could compromise future elections without intervention.</p>\n<p>Bannon expressed skepticism about the reliability and complexity of ballot tabulation machines used in elections, while acknowledging he liked to stay focused on other election concerns as well- in a multipronged strategy for winning the 2024 eletion.</p>\n<p>Bannon, who has acknowledged the importance of the election machine activists, remarked, “I’m not a machine guy. I think the machines are overcomplicated. It should be like counting cash in Vegas and it’s not. It’s way too sophisticated.”</p>\n<p>Bannon’s concerns about the transparency and accuracy of election technology are likely shared by the majority within the America First movement. They advocate for simpler, more transparent voting systems to ensure accountability and trust in election outcomes.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>As the WarRoom host has actively shared information to empower his audience to utilize resources for Get Out The Vote initiatives, emphasizing these tactics as crucial to achieving electoral victories.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Bannon’s concerns about the transparency and accuracy of election technology are likely shared by the majority within the America First movement. They advocate for simpler, more transparent voting systems to ensure accountability and trust in election outcomes.</p>\n<p>The conversation pivoted to specific instances of concern, citing discrepancies in ballot tabulation machines and the certification processes overseen by election officials. Castor highlighted a troubling finding: “In one area alone, there were 9,100 more votes counted than there were ballots cast.” This revelation underscored systemic errors in the election process, casting doubt on the accuracy and integrity of the results certified by state and local officials.</p>\n<p>Hornik, founder of <a href=\"https://unite4freedom.com/\">United Sovereign Americans</a>, echoed these concerns, detailing her organization’s efforts to audit voter registration anomalies in New York. “We might have uncovered over 5 million felonies in the New York state voter registration list,” Hornik asserted, pointing to significant irregularities that persisted into the 2022 midterm elections.</p>\n<p>Both Castor and Hornik emphasized the big picture of these findings beyond partisan outcomes, framing the issue as a fundamental civil rights battle. “This is not about election outcomes or candidates,” Hornik emphasized, “but a massive constitutional fight for civil rights and equal protection under the law.”</p>\n<p>Their discussion exposed the strategic approach of the America First movement, intertwining legal challenges with grassroots activism to Get Out The Vote, with Trump-endorsed initiatives like <a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/?trk=public_post-text\">Trump Force 47</a> and <a href=\"https://swampthevoteusa.com/\">Swamp the Vote</a>.</p>\n<p>Castor argued for federal intervention to enforce election standards set by Congress, urging federal judges to acknowledge and rectify systemic flaws in election administration. “We need a national conversation on fixing these issues,” Castor insisted, foreseeing a potential firestorm if these concerns were left unaddressed.</p>\n<p>The grassroots efforts led by Hornik’s organization, coupled with Castor’s legal expertise, exemplify a concerted effort within the America First movement to restore confidence in electoral processes. By challenging the status quo and highlighting discrepancies undermining voter trust, they aim to ensure that future elections meet the rigorous standards necessary for a functioning democracy.</p>\n<p>Castor, Hornik, and Bannon underscore a multifaceted approach to safeguarding election integrity, which is an essential part of the strategy for winning elections. Their combined efforts illustrate how legal challenges and grassroots activism intersect to uphold constitutional principles and restore public trust in America’s electoral system.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch the WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Castor And Hornik Reveals Legal Filings To Ensure Pennsylvania Election Results Are Accurate</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Saturday discussion on his program War Room, Steve Bannon, alongside guests Mike Davis and Bill McGinley, delved into the implications of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling. The ruling overturned Chevron deference, marking what Bannon sees as a critical victory in the America First/ MAGA agenda to deconstruct the administrative state- each adding that, however, there is more for the WarRoom to accomplish still.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon opened the discussion by celebrating the ruling as a historic achievement. “This is a monumental decision,” he declared, emphasizing the long-term significance of dismantling the administrative state. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This agenda, which Bannon said he first articulated at CPAC in 2017, has been a cornerstone of his vision for reducing government overreach. “The only way you take down the Leviathan,” Bannon said, “is to go after the administrative state.”</p>\n<p>Davis discussed Chevron deference, a legal doctrine established in 1984 that allowed courts to defer to administrative agencies’ interpretation of ambiguous laws.</p>\n<p>Bannon and his allies see the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn this doctrine as a major victory in their efforts to limit the power of bureaucratic agencies.</p>\n<p>“The Chevron deference is dead,” Bannon said, noting that even far-left legal scholar Lawrence Tribe acknowledged the ruling’s significance by tweeting, “The administrative state is dead.”</p>\n<p>The WarRoom conversation also highlighted the strategic efforts behind this judicial shift. Bannon praised figures like Neil Gorsuch, Don McGahn, and Mike Davis for their roles in this achievement.</p>\n<p>Bannon discussed Gorsuch, now a Supreme Court Justice. He described him as instrumental in challenging the Chevron doctrine during his tenure on the 10th Circuit.</p>\n<p>“Justice Gorsuch was the intellectual force behind this case,” Bannon noted, underscoring the careful selection of judges who would support this vision. He credited McGahn, former White House Counsel, for his foresight in compiling a list of potential justices committed to this cause.</p>\n<p>Davis argued that the ruling would rebalance power distribution among Congress, the executive branch, and administrative agencies. “What the courts have done for 40 years is defer to these executive branch agencies,” he explained. “This decision ensures that elected officials are more accountable for laws and regulations.”</p>\n<p>Davis criticized the reliance on expert opinions, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Hell no, we don’t need to defer to the experts,” Davis exclaimed, pointing to policies like the six-foot social distancing rule and mask mandates as examples of misguided deference.</p>\n<p>“We saw what happened during COVID lockdowns when we deferred to the experts. They destroyed our country and so many people’s lives,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>“This is just the beginning,” Bannon affirmed, signaling that the fight against the administrative state is far from over. The purpose of the WarRoom is to direct people to where they can make an impact on the process by understanding their political opponents’ tactics and drive.</p>\n<p>McGinley emphasized the need for continued grassroots mobilization and strategic judicial appointments. He argued that the conservative movement must remain vigilant in appointing judges to uphold this vision. “We have a 20-year project ahead of us,” Bannon echoed, “and it’s just started with taking down the administrative state.”</p>\n<p>In the “War Room” discussion, McGinley outlined several crucial points about the Democratic Party’s strategies and the broader political landscape.</p>\n<p>McGinley emphasized the Democratic Party’s strategic use of fundraising. Significant funds raised at events, such as the $28 million from Radio City Music Hall and the $30 million from Hollywood, are directed into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and state parties rather than solely Biden’s campaign. This approach supports the broader party infrastructure, making it adaptable and ready for any political shifts. “That money is actually going into the DNC and the Democratic state parties,” McGinley explained, highlighting the flexibility and power of this financial structure.</p>\n<p>He also highlighted the party’s readiness to replace President Biden if necessary, considering high-profile alternatives like Gavin Newsom, Michelle Obama, or Oprah Winfrey. This preparation underscores the party’s focus on maintaining control and ensuring electoral success. “There is a coup going on right now, a coup against Biden,” McGinley stated, noting that the New York Times and major donors are signaling a readiness to move on from Biden if he cannot win against Trump.</p>\n<p>McGinley contrasted this with the Republican Party’s grassroots strategy. He noted that while the Democrats invest heavily in a centralized infrastructure, the Republicans rely more on grassroots volunteers and local efforts. This grassroots approach is crucial for mobilizing voters and maintaining election integrity.</p>\n<p>“The Democratic Party is more top-down, while the Republican Party is more of a bottom-up party,” McGinley observed, with Bannon emphasizing the importance of initiatives like the precinct strategy and volunteer mobilization.</p>\n<p>McGinley, <a href=\"https://rumble.com/embed/v525tih/?pub=c28ob\">who later in the show</a> recommended action items for the WarRoom audience to combat the Democrats,  also addressed the significant role of dark money in supporting the Democratic Party’s goals, providing them with a resource and influence advantage. This funding mechanism allows the party to maintain a robust and flexible infrastructure. “The dark money network they’ve established is a major factor,” McGinley noted, stressing the need for Republicans to counteract this influence through grassroots efforts and strategic planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall, McGinley highlighted the Democratic Party’s sophisticated strategies and the necessity for Republicans to counteract these strategies with strong grassroots efforts.</strong></p>\n<p>Bannon emphasized two primary areas of focus for his audience while he is away:</p>\n<p>1) National Security and the 25th Amendment: Bannon stressed the importance of highlighting potential national security issues and possibly invoking the 25th Amendment to address President Joe Biden’s perceived incapacity. He argued that this could lead to a constitutional crisis, which he believes should be brought to the forefront of public discourse. “We have to make that process as painful as possible,” Bannon stated, urging his audience to expose the underlying motives and mechanisms behind any attempt to replace Biden.</p>\n<p>2) The Democratic Party’s Power Structure and Dark Money: Bannon called attention to the Democratic Party’s investment in infrastructure and the influence of dark money. He pointed out that significant funds are being channeled not directly into Biden’s campaign, but into the DNC and state parties, making it easier to replace Biden with another candidate if needed. Bannon emphasized the need to follow the money and understand the Democratic Party’s strategies. “When you see these massive fundraisers, that money is actually going into the DNC and the Democratic state parties,” he explained. This, he argued, allows the party to maintain control and adapt quickly to political opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://swampthevoteusa.com/\"><strong>Swamp the Vote</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://trumpforce47.com/?trk=public_post-text\">Trump Force 47</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.project2025.org/\">Project 2025</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more context, watch this WarRoom segment:</strong></p>\n<h1>“The Administrative State Is Dead”: The WarRoom Celebrates Historic Victories In Supreme Court</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a WarRoom conversation on Friday, Mike Davis and Steve Bannon discussed the significant Supreme Court decision to overturn Chevron deference, emphasizing its monumental impact on limiting the power of executive branch agencies.</p>\n<p><strong>“This ruling is a win for constitutional rights and a pushback against the Biden Justice Department’s politicized actions,” Bannon said in reaction to the news. </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“The Chevron decision is critical in reasserting judicial and congressional oversight over executive agencies,”Davis told Bannon. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The Chevron deference, a 40-year-old precedent, allowed courts to defer to executive agencies’ interpretations of their statutory authority, often resulting in these agencies expanding their power. Davis highlights that the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision marks a pivotal change, showcasing the importance of President Trump’s judicial appointments, which shifted the court’s balance.</p>\n<p>Bannon and Davis explored the implications of this decision, especially for ordinary Americans. For example, according to Davis, farmers in Iowa previously faced stringent regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that could be crushing. The decision is viewed as a step towards restoring the Founders’ original intent by reining in the administrative state and ensuring that courts, not agencies, interpret statutes.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We have long sought to control the expansive federal bureaucracy, metaphorically described as the Leviathan,” Bannon said. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The discussion delves into the broader context of limiting government overreach, with Bannon referencing the long-standing conservative goal of controlling the expansive federal bureaucracy, which Bannon metaphorically describes as the “Leviathan.”</p>\n<p>Davis credits figures like Jeff Clark and Neil Gorsuch for their vision and efforts in challenging and aiming to dismantle the administrative state. Davis points out that the Chevron decision is critical in this direction, underscoring its importance in reasserting judicial and congressional oversight over executive agencies.</p>\n<p>The conversation touches on other significant Supreme Court decisions. Davis mentioned a case where the court overturned a Ninth Circuit ruling that had prohibited cities from banning homeless camps in public parks, citing it as another example of the court correcting misguided lower court decisions. This ruling is celebrated as a victory for communities affected by such policies.</p>\n<p>Bannon and Davis also discuss the broader political and judicial landscape, noting the importance of preventing left-leaning judges like Merrick Garland from attaining lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court. They express relief that Trump’s victory prevented Garland’s appointment, which they believe would have perpetuated liberal judicial activism.</p>\n<p>This ruling is seen as a win for constitutional rights and a pushback against what they perceive as the Biden Justice Department’s politicized actions. Davis emphasizes the need to prevent the justice system from being used to target political enemies, contrasting the treatment of the January 6 defendants with that of leftist activists involved in disruptive or violent protests.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch these WarRoom segments:</p>\n<h1>Mike Davis: Chevron Overturning Greatly Hinders “The Dangers Of An All-Powerful Federal Government”</h1>\n<h1>Mike Davis Celebrates Supreme Court Fischer Ruling: “Win For The January 6th Defendants”</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Steve Bannon, host of the WarRoom program, delivered a stark warning on Friday about the current state of affairs in the United States after the Thursday night debate between President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, drawing striking parallels to events preceding World War I. Bannon’s urgent message highlights the nation’s potential crises and calls for heightened civic engagement to understand and address these critical issues.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“We have a national security crisis right now, that is going to lead to a constitutional crisis about the 25th Amendment very shortly.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ironically, on this date, June 28, 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, marked the catalyst for World War I. Following their narrow escape from an earlier assassination attempt with a bomb, they were ultimately killed by Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo, triggering a chain of events that led Europe inexorably toward war.</p>\n<p><strong> “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”- George Santayana</strong>.</p>\n<p>Speaking on June 28, 2024, Bannon expressed deep concerns about the trajectory of American politics, particularly highlighting what he perceives as a looming national security crisis that could escalate into a constitutional crisis under the 25th Amendment.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv\">25th Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution clarifies procedures for presidential succession, vice presidential vacancies, and presidential disability. It allows the Vice President to assume the presidency if the office becomes vacant, addresses procedures for filling a vacant vice presidency, and provides a mechanism for temporarily transferring presidential powers if the President is unable to discharge their duties. This amendment aims to ensure continuity of government and effective leadership in cases of presidential incapacity or unexpected vacancies.</p>\n<p>Bannon began his address by referencing the assassination of  Ferdinand in 1914, emphasizing how seemingly small events can trigger significant historical consequences. He drew a direct comparison, suggesting that the current political climate in the U.S. mirrors the precariousness of the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>Central to Bannon’s critique was his assessment of President Joe Biden’s leadership, whom he repeatedly exposed as “illegitimate.” Bannon said that Biden’s debate performance showed the world his incompetence and inability to effectively lead the nation, particularly in matters of national security, adding that President Trump’s participation in the debate was a deliberate effort to expose Biden’s shortcomings, framing it as a selfless act in the national interest.</p>\n<p>To support his viewpoint, Bannon pointed to Scott Jennings, a known associate of Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who echoed Bannon’s concerns about the severity of the crisis during a CNN appearance in reaction to the Trump-Biden debate. According to Bannon, Jennings’ agreement underscored the bipartisan recognition of the critical nature of the situation despite their usual political differences.</p>\n<p>Bannon criticized mainstream media figures like Tom Friedman, accusing them of covering up Biden’s alleged incapacity. He argued that these journalists, whom he described as part of a “Pretorian guard,” were complicit in protecting Biden and misleading the public about his fitness for office. Bannon suggested that this media complicity aimed to pave the way for potential political transitions to figures like Gavin Newsom or Michelle Obama.</p>\n<p>The Praetorian Guard, established by Emperor Augustus, protected Roman emperors and wielded significant political influence. Headquartered in Rome, they played a pivotal role in Roman stability and sometimes intervened in imperial succession. Emperor Constantine disbanded them in 312 AD, marking a significant shift in Roman political dynamics.</p>\n<p>Beyond domestic implications, Bannon warned of the geopolitical consequences of perceived American weakness under the current administration. He expressed concerns that adversaries such as Russia, China, and Iran might exploit this perceived leadership vacuum to the detriment of U.S. interests globally. Bannon further questioned the readiness of American military forces under Biden’s leadership.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Bannon predicted significant political upheaval, asserting that Biden would not be the Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. Instead, he envisioned a scenario where Trump would secure a substantial victory, with the Republican Party gaining significant seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Bannon emphasized the urgency for the WarRoom audience to address what he described as a crisis of national and constitutional significance. He urged the public to consider the implications of Biden’s failures and the looming constitutional crisis, framing Trump’s potential inauguration on January 20, 2025, as pivotal for the nation’s future.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch these WarRoom segments:</p>\n<h1>Steve Bannon: We Have A National Security Crisis That’s Going To Lead To A Constitutional Crisis On 25th Amendment</h1>\n<h1>Steve Bannon: Biden’s Failing Faculties Will Lead To National Security Crisis , U.S. Imperial Praetorian Guard Previews Next Emperor</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>Donald J. Trump riding down that golden escalator changed a lot in this country. But perhaps the greatest thing of all was Americans no longer had to settle for leaders who lie to them.</p>\n<p>I hate being lied to, and I think millions upon millions of Americans feel the same way. With President Trump, we finally had someone running for office who told the truth. True to form, he was the only person on stage Thursday night that was real. Everything else was a lie. What we witnessed on CNN was not a debate. It was a set up.</p>\n<p>Something was up when the Democrat candidate, who last time they barely let leave the basement, agreed to a live CNN debate in <span>June</span>, the earliest ever. In what’s left of his skull full of mush, Biden is still the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cd977f7ff301993f7976974ba07c5495#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20_%20Sen.,he%20finished%20near%20the%20bottom.\"><span>top law student</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/fact-check-biden-driving-18-wheeler/index.html\"><span>truck driving</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/biden-south-africa-arrest-mandela.html\"><span>arrested with Nelson Mandela</span></a> savant who will take you \"behind the barn.” This is the same deranged pompous idiot who has been challenging voters to I.Q. tests and push up contests for four decades. Of course he thinks he can still debate. The question is, who let him think he could?</p>\n<p>Nothing about Biden has changed since 2020. He wasn’t cognitively fit then, and he certainly isn’t now. All that changed were the talking points and marching orders. A media that has been propping up a <a href=\"https://x.com/dom_lucre/status/1800319301335093744?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>husk</span></a> for four years suddenly let go.</p>\n<p>Never was a more appropriate term applied than when President Trump dubbed them \"Fake News.” Watching the \"debate” had an eerily similar feeling to Nov. 3, when Fox refused to call Ohio, Florida, and Texas for Trump, but immediately called Arizona for Biden, to make it seem as if President Trump wasn’t actually winning in a landslide. As the words were coming out of the anchor’s mouths, you could almost see the puppet strings. It was the same thing Thursday evening. What you were watching was not what was really happening. Everything was choreographed — down to the mute buttons on the microphones. They did the same routine of hiding Biden out for a week, pumping him full of God knows what, rigging all the rules in his favor. But it wasn’t setting him up for success. It was giving him a false sense of security, and setting him up to fail.</p>\n<p>And when it was all over, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox had the chyrons ready: \"SOURCES: ‘AGGRESSIVE PANIC’ FOR DEMS AFTER BIDEN’S PERFORMANCE TONIGHT.”</p>\n<p>Biden has been tripping up Air Force One for three years now<span>. </span>But suddenly <span>now</span> Biden is unfit? If all the liars and frauds in the Fake News are being sincere, why aren’t they calling for his resignation immediately? If you can’t run for president, you can’t be president. And then maybe they could ask, who the hell has been running the country all this time?</p>\n<p>But of course they are not being sincere. They are reading a script. If you can be <a href=\"https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/\"><span>installed</span></a>, you can be uninstalled. And Biden has outlived his usefulness. They tried to do it the easy way. <a href=\"https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/biden-hosts-obama-for-lunch-at-the-white-house/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=t.co\"><span>Sending</span></a> Obama to the White House for lunch. Not so subtle <a href=\"https://x.com/davidaxelrod/status/1721189538880516252?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>tweets</span></a> from David Axelrod. It was only a matter of time that they would resort to more Machiavellian measures.</p>\n<p>So pardon me if I’m not giddy at Biden’s demise. Biden was always irrelevant. He’s just another corrupt, senile puppet, in a long line of corrupt puppets. A figurehead of a corrupt system that is about to replace a nominee without a single vote from the People. Talk about a \"threat to Democracy.”</p>\n<p>\"Our Country is being destroyed,” President Trump said, in one of his most powerful moments. \"As you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time at this debate. There shouldn’t be a debate.”</p>\n<p>President Trump is right. Our Country is being destroyed while the puppet masters replace another puppet.</p>\n<p>Now, more than ever, we must bring back the only thing in our politics that is real. Bring back Trump.</p>\n</div>\n"

As they prepared to sign copies, Bannon jokingly commented, \"By the way, I will need a Sharpie here. Of course, if it’s Poso, it’s gotta be some scam associated with him.” Posobiec responded with humor, \"Exactly. Poso will monetize anything.

Bannon explained the purpose behind this initiative: \"The proceeds of this are going to a good cause to make something culturally relevant. We’ll be able to talk to you about it, the day after it happens, but you are the only reason I would agree to this is that…”</p>\n<p>The conversation then shifted to Mike Davis, who had been with Posobiec earlier and who faced harassment at the Supreme Court building. Bannon asked Posobiec about Davis, \"Tell me about Mike Davis. Why were they picking on Mike Davis? And how did you, how did you jump in?” As they signed books, the atmosphere remained light-hearted and energetic.</p>\n<p>This fun exchange showcased the camaraderie between Posobiec and Bannon as they promoted the Political “Prisoner Edition” of Inhumans.

The old order is over. Accusations are evidence. Activism means bigotry and hate. Criminals are allowed to roam free. Citizens are locked up. An appetite for vengeance is unleashed—to deplatform, debank, destroy. This is the daily news, yet none of it’s new. Patterns from the past make sense of our present. They also foretell a terrifying future we might be condemned to endure.</em></p>\n<p><em>For nearly 250 years, far-left uprisings have followed the same battle plans—from the first call for change to last innocent executed, from denial a revolution is even happening to declaration of the new order. Unhumans takes readers on a shocking, sweeping, and succinct journey through history to share the untold stories of radical takeovers that textbooks don’t teach.</em></p>\n<p><em>And there is one conclusion: We’re in a new revolution right now.</em></p>\n<p><em>But this is not a book about ideology or politics. Unhumans reveals that communism, socialism, Marxism, and all other radical-isms are not philosophies but tactics—tactics that are specifically designed to unleash terror on everyday people and revoke their human rights to life, liberty, and property. These are the forces of unhumanity. This is what they do. Every. Single. Time. Unhumans steals their playbook, breaks apart their strategies piece by piece, and lays out the tactics of what it takes to fight back—and win, using real-world examples.</em></p>\n<p><em>Unhumans is the essential read for every concerned citizen both of the US and worldwide. We must stop what is coming.</em></p>\n<p>According to Skyhorse Publishing, “Unhumans” by Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec explores the untold stories of radical takeovers often overlooked in traditional education. The book explores the concepts of communism, socialism, and Marxism as tactics that threaten human rights and aim to instill fear among ordinary people. Posobiec analyzes these strategies, offering real-world examples and techniques to resist and overcome such ideologies.</p>\n<p>Bannon and Posobiec also discussed the book in great detail at the People’s Convention in Detroit in mid-June, and Bannon provided some in-depth insights on various topics.</p>\n<p>During this exchange, Bannon said the Summer of 2024 is the “The Summer of Fight” and went into detail about his concept of “Next Man Up” as he is about to be imprisoned for the remaining election season for a misdemeanor.</p>\n<h1>LIVE FROM THE PEOPLE’S CONVENTION: THE SUMMER OF FIGHT W/ STEVE BANNON</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In Thursday’s WarRoom conversation between Steve Bannon and Caroline Wren, Wren detailed her involvement with the explosive case surrounding Ashley Biden’s diary. This case has garnered significant public attention due to its controversial nature and the subsequent actions of the FBI. As the debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden intensifies in the lead-up to the 2024 election, this issue has become even more timely, shedding light on potential biases and procedural discrepancies in the handling of politically sensitive information.</p>\n<p>Wren explained that her involvement began at a Trump campaign fundraiser a few months before the 2020 election. At this event, someone approached her, claiming they had moved into an apartment and discovered  prescriptions and Ashley Biden’s diary under the bed. The diary contained shocking revelations, including federal crimes such as child molestation and extensive drug use, corroborated by the medications found.</p>\n<p>Faced with this startling information, Wren contacted the Trump campaign attorneys, who subsequently reached out to the FBI, urging them to retrieve the diary due to its potential as evidence of serious crimes. Despite their efforts, the FBI did not respond for three days, according to Wren, leaving the diary unattended. During this time, the person who found the diary contacted James O’Keefe, leading to its eventual exposure through Project Veritas.</p>\n<p>Wren told Bannon that she and her associates’ meticulous adherence to legal protocols contrasts with the harsh treatment of others involved in the case. She recounted the dramatic FBI raid on James O’Keefe’s residence, where he was forcibly detained despite his prior attempts to return the diary to law enforcement in Delaware. This raised concerns about the FBI’s selective and seemingly biased actions.</p>\n<p>Wren further detailed the legal repercussions the woman who discovered the diary faced. She was charged with transporting stolen property across state lines, although Wren argued that the diary was not stolen but left behind in the apartment. Wren expressed empathy for Ashley Biden, recognizing the diary’s revelations as a reflection of a deeply troubled individual.</p>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Wren highlighted the perceived discrepancies in the FBI’s actions, suggesting that the bureau was more interested in suppressing the diary’s contents until after the election. She questioned the integrity of the investigation, pointing out the FBI’s lack of immediate response when initially contacted about the diary.</p>\n<p>The timing of Wren’s revelations is particularly significant as the political landscape heats up with the upcoming presidential debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The handling of Ashley Biden’s diary and the broader implications of potential biases within federal agencies could influence public perception and voter sentiment. This issue underscores federal institutions’ intense scrutiny and politicization, raising questions about their impartiality and accountability.</p>\n<p>Wren’s narrative paints a picture of a contentious and politically charged situation, where adherence to legal procedures by one party is met with apparent indifference or hostility from the authorities.</p>\n<p>For more context, see the Carolina Wren WarRoom segment:</p>\n<h1>Caroline Wren Exposes How The FBI Has Targeted A Woman For Reporting Ashley Biden’s Diary</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In their  Wednesday WarRoom discussion, Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project, and Steve Bannon, host of the WarRoom program, focus on significant upcoming Supreme Court decisions and their potential impact, particularly concerning presidential immunity and the Fisher case. Davis emphasizes the critical nature of these cases, describing them as “monumental.”</p>\n<p>Davis and Bannon focused on violence directed toward the Supreme Court and related judicial matters. They highlighted concerns about the left’s approach to the judiciary, specifically regarding cases and decisions that are perceived as controversial or politically charged. Davis emphasizes the seriousness of these issues, particularly in cases like presidential immunity and other significant legal precedents.</p>\n<p>Davis asserts that the left’s actions and rhetoric against the Supreme Court indicate broader attempts to undermine its authority and decisions. He discusses the protests and reactions outside the Supreme Court, suggesting that these reactions are symptomatic of a more significant effort to influence or intimidate the court’s decisions through public pressure and demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Davis expressed deep concern about the violent rhetoric and actions directed towards the Supreme Court, viewing them as part of a strategy to sway judicial outcomes through external pressures rather than allowing the court to deliberate independently and impartially.</p>\n<p>The cases’ highlights involved presidential immunity, which determines whether a sitting president can imprison a predecessor for official acts while in office.</p>\n<p>Davis argues that allowing such prosecutions would “destroy the presidency and therefore destroy the country,” pointing out that it would set a dangerous precedent where future presidents could prosecute their predecessors for decisions made while in office.</p>\n<p>Davis underscores the importance of the Fisher. This case addresses the Biden administration’s use of a statute intended for corporate fraud to prosecute former President Trump and numerous January 6th defendants. Bannon asserts that this case will “cut to the heart of the Biden crime family,” suggesting it highlights the administration’s politicization of justice.</p>\n<p>The conversation then shifts to other important cases, including the Chevron Deference, which Bannon calls the Mack Daddy. Davis and Bannon agree that the outcome of these cases will significantly affect the administrative state and broader political dynamics. They also discuss a recent Supreme Court ruling in Murphy v. Missouri, where the court ruled that there was no First Amendment violation when the Biden administration pressured tech companies to censor information. Davis criticizes this decision, emphasizing the need to update antitrust laws to prevent tech monopolies from censoring dissenting voices.</p>\n<p>Chevron Deference is a legal principle derived from a landmark case, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984). This principle requires courts to defer to administrative agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutes they administer as long as those interpretations are reasonable. It gives administrative agencies the authority to interpret and apply laws within their jurisdiction unless their interpretations are unreasonable or contrary to clear congressional intent.</p>\n<p>Chevron Deference is crucial because it impacts the balance of power between administrative agencies and the judiciary. Critics argue that Chevron’s deference gives too much discretion to unelected bureaucrats, potentially allowing them to make policy decisions that should be the domain of elected representatives or the courts. Therefore, decisions related to Chevron’s deference can have significant implications for regulatory policy and the scope of executive authority in the United States.</p>\n<p>Throughout the discussion, both Davis and Bannon stress the stakes of the upcoming Supreme Court decisions, linking them to the broader political battle leading up to the 2024 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Davis concludes by noting the importance of President Trump’s judicial appointments in shaping the current conservative majority on the court and highlighting their lasting impact on American jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch Wednesday’s segment:</p>\n<h1>Mike Davis Reports On 6-3 SCOTUS Decision With Barrett, Kavanaugh, And Roberts Joining Liberals In Declaring No First Amendment Violations Took Place When Biden Admin Pressured Social Media Platforms Into Censoring Covid Information</h1>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a candid and revealing WarRoom conversation with Steve Bannon on Wednesday, Lunden Roberts shed light on her life with Hunter Biden and their daughter, Navy Joan Roberts. The dialogue unveiled poignant details about their tumultuous journey, which is exposed in Roberts’ upcoming book, Out of the Shadows: My Life with Hunter Biden.</p>\n<p>Roberts expressed profound concern over her daughter Navy Joan’s safety, citing the lack of acknowledgment and protection from the Biden family despite legal agreements.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>In her interview with  Bannon, Roberts said, “It’s terrifying to think that Navy Joan could be at risk simply because her father’s family refuses to acknowledge her existence,” expressing her deep-seated worries about the repercussions of familial rejection on their daughter’s security.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Roberts elaborated on the stringent make-shift security measures she has implemented in their Arkansas home, including surveillance systems and firearms, underscoring her unwavering commitment to safeguarding Navy Joan. “Living without federal protection in a rural community leaves us vulnerable,” she lamented, highlighting the disparities in security afforded to other Biden family members.</p>\n<p>Her apprehensions stem not only from personal safety but also from emotional implications. “Every child deserves to feel loved and acknowledged,” Roberts asserted, revealing the emotional toll of navigating Navy Joan’s upbringing amidst public scrutiny and familial neglect. She emphasized the impact of this rejection on her daughter’s well-being, stressing the need for Hunter Biden and his family to step forward in acknowledging their paternal responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Roberts’ poignant reflections shed light on the intersection of personal choices and public scrutiny, resonating with single mothers navigating high-profile relationships. Her unwavering advocacy for Navy Joan’s recognition underscores the broader implications of familial dynamics in the political sphere, challenging societal norms and expectations.</p>\n<p>The conversation started with Bannon’s introduction of Roberts as the author behind what is anticipated to be the most controversial book of the year. Out of the Shadows promises an insider’s account into the complex world of Hunter Biden, where personal dynamics intertwine with public scrutiny. Navy Joan, their daughter, emerges as a central figure, embodying both the joy and challenges of Roberts’ journey.</p>\n<p>Navy Joan, described by Roberts as intelligent and vibrant, turns six this August, coinciding with the book’s release. Roberts, residing in Arkansas with her daughter, highlighted the minimal involvement of Hunter Biden in Navy Joan’s life despite legal agreements. She recounted efforts to establish a connection, including court mandates for Zoom calls and financial support negotiations, which painted a stark contrast to Biden’s initial assurance upon learning of Navy Joan’s impending arrival.</p>\n<p>The conversation turned poignant as Roberts detailed her journey from small-town Arkansas to Washington, D.C., where she initially crossed paths with Hunter Biden while working at Rosemont Seneca. Their relationship, though intermittent, intensified during Roberts’ pregnancy. Despite initial assurances from Biden, Roberts recounted a gradual withdrawal of support, leaving her to navigate pregnancy and early motherhood largely on her own.</p>\n<p>Roberts’ upbringing in the South, steeped in familial values and community ties, stood in stark contrast to the whirlwind of Washington politics and personal turmoil she found herself in. Her decision to return to Arkansas, where family support became paramount, underscored the challenges faced by single mothers navigating high-profile relationships.</p>\n<p>The conversation with Bannon also delved into security concerns for Navy Joan, highlighting Roberts’ vigilance in safeguarding her daughter. Living in a rural community without federal protection, Roberts expressed concerns over potential threats, necessitating stringent security measures at home, including firearms and surveillance systems.</p>\n<p>Throughout the dialogue, Bannon pressed on the discrepancies in familial acknowledgment and security measures afforded to Navy Joan compared to other members of the Biden family. Roberts’ candid responses underscored a persistent desire for Hunter Biden and his family to acknowledge and protect their daughter, despite legal resolutions and public scrutiny.</p>\n<p>As Out of the Shadows prepares to hit shelves, Roberts’ narrative promises not only a personal memoir but a critical examination of familial responsibility and the impact of political dynamics on personal lives. Her courage in sharing this story serves as a testament to the resilience of single mothers navigating complex relationships in the public eye.</p>\n<p>For more context, watch this series of segments from Wednesday’s WarRoom:</p>\n<h1>Hunter Biden Baby Mama Lunden Roberts Exposes Hard Drug Lifestyle With Hunter Biden</h1>\n<h1>Hunter Biden Baby Mama Lunden Roberts Reveals Securing Child Support From Hunter Biden</h1>\n<h1>\"Why Exclude A Little Girl That Is [Biden] Blood?”: Hunter Biden Baby Mama Exposes Jill Biden For Excluding Navy From Biden Family</h1>\n<h1>Hunter Biden Baby Mama Refuses To Read Ashley Biden Diary Due To Hunter’s Actions Causing \"Anxiety”</h1>\n<h1>\"Why Not Acknowledge A Granddaughter And Embrace Her From The Beginning?”: Hunter Biden’s Baby Mama Wants Answers From Joe Biden</h1>\n</div>\n"

It didn’t add up, and neither did the numbers in Fulton County. The first machine count had dragged on for days after Nov. 4, the day Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger promised the counting would be finished and President Trump’s over 103,000 vote lead was <a href=\"https://rumble.com/vviwe2-raffensperger-confirms-4.7-million-votes-video-cuts-final-5-days-later-is-5.html\"><span>insurmountable</span></a>. The 17,234 votes Fulton County had to come up with were important.</p>\n<p>\"The recount, we concluded that on Wednesday night [Dec. 2],” Barron <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LymShDFd9kA&amp;t=1840s\"><span>said</span></a> at the Fulton Election Board meeting to certify the results. \"We submitted our results and then yesterday the state allowed us to do reconciliation. The results changed.”</p>\n<p>That was an understatement.</p>\n<p>When you have a problem like a 17,000 vote discrepancy in an election you’re claiming was decided by less than 13,000 votes, who do you call? The Elections Group, of course. They seemed to pop up everywhere, out of nowhere, in 2020. Setting up <a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/22/brandtjen/media/plheof05/part-b-plus-flyer-plus-part-c.pdf\"><span>drop boxes</span></a> and training election officials in Madison, Wisconsin.

Its members <a href=\"https://www.iaccr.net/PDF/iaccrseptemberpresentation.pdf\"><span>briefing</span></a> CISA on how to \"#PROTECT2020.” Protect it from whom?</p>\n<p>Barron sent an email to Ryan Macias, of the Elections Group, at 12:13 p.m. There was no subject and nothing in the body of the email, only a file attached, a very important file, entitled, \"Batches Loaded Report.”</p>\n<p>Three and a half years after that email was sent, the Georgia State Election Board heard the results of an investigation into the recount, and confirmed Fulton County violated election rules.</p>\n<p>The evidence brought by independent investigators showed over 20,000 ballots were inserted into both the original results and the second machine count out of thin air. Simply put, Fulton County did not have the paper ballots to justify their original results, and they got caught. Of course, investigators and lawyers from Brad Raffensperger’s Secretary of State office, who handled the investigation into the complaint, claimed otherwise. <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1787926280697987401?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>Don’t worry</span></a> about the electronic record of the votes (which are counted…electronically), they said, we have the paper ballots — they just won’t let anyone else see them. And Fulton County is seeking to destroy them. Sure, the investigation confirmed there are <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1787931381504307566?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>missing ballot images</span></a> and duplicate ballots. Were they counted? <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1787951858071347390?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w?\"><span>Who’s to say?</span></a> It’s not like they could go check the cast vote record and the paper ballots. Oh, wait.</p>\n<p>The mantra during the hours-long review of the case at the Georgia State Capitol last month was, \"Let’s just move on.” Tell that to President Donald J. Trump and 18 others who Fulton County is <span>trying to put in jail </span>over the 2020 Election.</p>\n<p>It was something to behold. The \"experts” from the Secretary of State’s office tried to characterize the complainants as plebes and know-nothings, while exposing that they know next to nothing about their own elections. They say what they’re told to say. Despite their efforts to discredit the complaint, they were forced to admit the truth: Fulton County does not have supporting documentation to back up its election results in 2020.</p>\n<p>Charlene McGowan, the general counsel for the Secretary of State, admitted as much when she <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1788402649953349729?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>said</span></a> ballot images are \"part of the paper trail that we use to confirm the accuracy of the results.”</p>\n<p>All in-person votes in Fulton County, roughly 375,000, have no ballot images from the original results, and, according to the complaint, there are 17,852 missing ballot images from the recount. Statewide, there were <a href=\"https://joehoft.com/breaking-exclusive-voter-ga-reports-that-1-7-million-2020-election-ballot-images-in-georgia-were-destroyed/\"><span>1.7 million ballot images missing or destroyed</span></a> after the Election. By McGowan’s own admission, Georgia does not have a paper trail to justify its results.</p>\n<p>McGowan confirmed ballot images are still missing, and duplicate ballots were scanned, they just didn’t bother to check if they were counted, which would have been easy to do since they were given a <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1800218777373790367?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>list of the exact ballots</span></a> with corresponding batch numbers. They didn’t want to have to reveal the answer. According to the cast vote record, <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/671203484/20220111-Buell-Expert-Report-Final-Served\"><span>they were</span></a>.</p>\n<p>The Secretary of State’s office passed the blame off to Fulton County, which they said \"used improper procedures” during the machine recount. They never addressed how it was their own office that ordered Fulton to reconcile the count when it was off by over 17,000. Yes, Fulton County did send its results to an outside group, but that was okay because he was a paid consultant, according to a memorandum the state investigators did not produce publicly. It was the same for all their claims. Nothing was made public, and the complainants were not allowed to address the board, outside a two minute public comment period. Investigate yourselves, keep the findings hidden, and allow no rebuttal. Nice work if you can get it.</p>\n<p>Even the newly-appointed Republican Board member Rick Jeffares, hand-picked by Lt. Governor Burt Jones, was conveniently missing from the proceedings, leaving Dr. Janice Johnston the sole member to ask tough questions and offer motions for accountability, none of which were seconded.</p>\n<p>The rest of the Board seemed content, along with Fulton County and the Secretary of State, to brush the whole thing under the rug.</p>\n<p>\"There is a concept called res judicata, which is the civil equivalent of double jeopardy,” said Sara Tindall Ghazal, a Democrat Board member, wincing, when the fact that the hand count audit, which was the second count of the ballots, also included thousands of duplicates and false Biden votes, was brought up. \"We have already heard this. It has been done. It is finished.”</p>\n<p>The only problem is, no one has been held accountable or prosecuted once over the stolen 2020 Presidential Election, let alone twice, except, of course, those who objected to it. And if America is to have free and fair elections again, the matter is far from over.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Case Number 2023-025</span></strong></p>\n<p>It has been nearly 2 years since Joseph Rossi and Kevin Moncla sent an official <a href=\"https://www.georgiarecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/complaint.pdf\"><span>complaint</span></a> to the State Election Board, revealing Fulton County had \"no physical ballots” for the votes it added to the recount. In all, Rossi, a retired PepsiCo executive and chemical engineer, and Moncla, an independent investigative journalist, discovered there were at least 42,000 votes in the certified count of the 2020 Presidential Election that have no actual paper trail, including duplicate votes, and over 20,000 from tabulators that \"do not exist.”</p>\n<p>Rossi and Moncla are emblematic of the countless patriots who have dedicated their lives since November 2020 to getting transparency and accountability to America’s voting systems. That transparency and accountability is sorely lacking in Georgia, and in Fulton County, in particular. <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1782083836089639324?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>Election</span></a> after <a href=\"https://www.georgiarecord.com/all-posts/2022/06/05/fulton-county-elections-are-getting-even-more-weird-emergency-meeting-called-to-recertify-after-discrepancies-found-in-machine-data-after-cobb-and-dekalb-debacle/\"><span>election</span></a>, Georgia certifies and <a href=\"https://www.emerald.tv/p/exclusive-fulton-county-gets-busted\"><span>re-certifies</span></a> results that are tangential to reality. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3464109-raffensperger-in-close-reelection-race-with-trump-backed-challenger-poll/\"><span>Close races</span></a> turn into unbelievable <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/raffensperger-leads-by-double-digits-likely-to-avoid-runoff/\"><span>landslides</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/politics_polls/status/1323869244707250176?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>landslides</span></a> turn into <a href=\"https://www.onlineathens.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/06/when-was-last-time-georgia-voted-blue-itrsquos-been-nearly-30-years/43004695/\"><span>unbelievably</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/biden-georgia-2020-election/\"><span>close</span></a> results.  Outcomes are <a href=\"https://decaturish.com/2022/06/breaking-hand-count-in-district-2-dekalb-commission-race-changes-runoff-picture/\"><span>flipped</span></a>, and only discovered if you’re lucky enough to get a real hand count.

The results are whatever they say they are, regardless of the facts and evidence.</p>\n<p>The evidence shows President Trump won Georgia. That was a problem for the powers that be, so the count was dragged out, and results were exchanged in order to create margins necessary for Biden to overcome a landslide defeat. When by 5 p.m. on Election Day in Atlanta <a href=\"https://fultoncountyga.gov/-/media/Departments/Registration-and-Elections/Board-of-Registration-and-Elections/Approved-Meeting-Minutes/Approved-Special-Minutes-1132020.ashx\"><span>only 14,152 people</span></a> had showed up to vote, they knew they had a problem. That’s the turnout equivalent of filling a dozen <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/e5KVJABwpQZtsvie6\"><span>circles</span></a> at a campaign rally. They were not going to have the votes to overcome President Trump’s massive lead, even with their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realLizUSA/status/1513585569779040262\"><span>drop box stuffing</span></a> on the front end, and their <a href=\"https://www.uncoverdc.com/2022/10/17/election-oversight-complaint-error-pair-causes-undercount-in-elections/\"><span>\"QR Code mismatch” error</span></a>, skimming rural Republican votes off the top. This is why there are no ballot images for in-person voting in Fulton County. This is why they kept scanning late at night after observers had left, \"<a href=\"https://www.georgiarecord.com/elections/2022/12/25/ruby-freeman-body-cam-admissions-revealed-in-the-georgia-ballot-scanning-scandal/\"><span>so the number would go up</span></a>.” This is why none of the early in-person votes were witnessed to and signed, why their machine seals were broken, the memory cards swapped out, and their \"results” were printed on <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/657652472/Fulton-County-Early-Voting-Complaint\"><span>different tabulators</span></a>. This is why the records they do have show 4,000 absentee ballots were scanned at the <a href=\"https://voterga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Press-Release-VoterGA-2020-Fulton-Election-Results-Manipulated-03-07-22.pdf\"><span>exact same time</span></a>. This is why after three counts, they ended up with three different results. And this is why the last two, both the hand count audit and the certified second machine count, had to rely on thousands of duplicate votes in order to try to replicate their first bogus result.</p>\n<p>Rossi and Moncla’s complaint makes this obvious. The State Election Board assigned case number SEB2023-025 to the complaint in April 2023. After slow-walking the investigation for months, it was finally set to be heard on December 19, when at the eleventh hour it was pulled from the Board meeting’s agenda. Raffensperger’s general counsel took the investigation over, and five months later, the Secretary of State’s office was finally ready to unveil its cover up.</p>\n<p><strong><span>‘It Did Not Come Up With the Same Number…’</span></strong></p>\n<p>Results of the second machine count were due by midnight on Dec. 2, 2020. Fulton County <a href=\"https://x.com/fultoninfo/status/1334374886865854464?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>announced</span></a> it had completed the recount at 12:52 a.m. But they didn’t have enough ballots. Twelve hours later, Barron was sending the insufficient totals to someone who was not an employee of Fulton County, the Secretary of State, or any office in the state of Georgia. Instead, he was sending the results, which came nowhere close to matching the original count, to the \"Elections Group,” a shadowy outfit that showed up in 2020 in very select places that happened to be the most important election offices in the country.</p>\n<p>By 11:15 p.m. the next evening, the news media was <a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/georgia-recount-results-live-blog-dec-3/85-20053bae-2b1a-49ea-8ee3-6befb474a5ef\"><span>reporting </span></a>there were \"about 3,200 votes outstanding” in Fulton County, a number eerily close to the 3,125 duplicates that would end up in the final count. The Batches Loaded Report — which contains the actual results as recorded as the votes are scanned — from the same day showed a 17,234 ballot shortfall. The media was checking the results on the Secretary of State’s website, which hadn’t been \"updated since earlier in the evening.” But where were these numbers coming from, if not the Batches Loaded Report, which is what Dominion uses to total the results, and shows <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/voting_system/files/Dominion_Voting_Systems_D-Suite_5.5_Test_Report_Rev_A.pdf\"><span>when</span></a> they were loaded into the server? Perhaps it was a second Batches Loaded Report, obtained by Moncla via a public records request for the Recount Batches Loaded Report, that showed Fulton County had managed to add over 16,000 votes to the total, but yielded yet a different result, at 527,741 votes, than the 511,543 of the first report, and the 527,925 Fulton County ultimately certified. As Dr. Johnston <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realLizUSA/status/1788402649953349729\"><span>said</span></a>, \"I would think that the third count…that took those very same ballots, and ran them through the big [ImageCast Central] ICC fast scanners, should have come up with the same number, and it did not come up with the same number.”</p>\n<p>This second Batches Loaded Report shows 13,000 early in-person votes were scanned between 10 p.m. and midnight on Dec. 2. But that’s impossible, according to the Batches Loaded Report Barron sent to Macias. Those votes were not there, and it was processed at 12:06 p.m. on Dec. 3, <em><span>after</span></em> those votes were supposedly scanned. Someone was fudging the numbers.</p>\n<p><strong><span>‘I didn’t go that far with this.’</span></strong></p>\n<p>At the State Capitol on May 7, members of the public had 2 minutes to address the Board. Joseph Rossi ended his time with one word: \"Vindicated.”</p>\n<p>The last time Rossi had a complaint investigated by the State Election Board, SEB2021-181, it ended up in the hands of Secretary of State investigator Vincent Zagorin, who <span>claimed</span> the numbers from the hand audit, the only time the paper ballots were counted by hand, \"are somewhat irrelevant.”</p>\n<p>Rossi had found 36 inconsistencies in the hand recount totaling 6,695 votes that should not have been included, for a net total of 4,081 false votes for Joe Biden. This is in one county (Fulton), in one subset category of votes (mail-ins), in an election decided by 11,779 votes. He had painstakingly gone over the hand count results to find the errors, which were <a href=\"https://voterga.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Brian-Kemp-Georgia-SEB-Letter-Joe-Rossi-11.17.2021.pdf\"><span>confirmed</span></a> by Governor Brian Kemp’s office, and have now been admitted to by Fulton County in a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/660426072/Signed-Consent-Order-SEB-2021-181-and-2022-025-Fulton-County-With-Exhibit-A-Redacted\"><span>consent order</span></a> signed in June 2023.</p>\n<p>Zagorin led the investigation, which crept on for more than a year. He <a href=\"https://sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/2022%20Transcripts.pdf\"><span>told</span></a> the State Election Board in March 2022 he purposefully did not count the total of the vote discrepancy and \"try to figure out exactly what the number was.” The errors only accounted for <span>over a third of the entire election margin</span>, after all.</p>\n<p>\"The ones that were in there twice,” Zagorin said, \"I didn’t sit there and write out the — the specific number.</p>\n<p>\"I didn’t go that far with this,” he said.</p>\n<p>Zagorin didn’t want to find the total just like McGowan didn’t want to find out if the duplicates were counted. Once you find the truth you have to do something about it. And they certainly didn’t want that.</p>\n<p>Months prior to Zagorin’s admission, back when she was working in Attorney General Chris Carr’s office, McGowan made a phone call to John James, an attorney and friend of Rossi’s who helped him with the analysis. Raffensperger was not responsible for the injection of thousands of votes in the hand count audit, she told him. James <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/John-James-Notes-copy.pdf\">transcribed</a> the conversation that took place on Dec. 4, 2021.</p>\n<p>\"The purpose of her call was apparently to convince me that the [Secretary of State] has no responsibility for the errors exposed in Fulton County,” he wrote. The message was, essentially, back off. It didn’t work. Rossi was able to get the 4,081 false Biden vote total from the hand recount on the record during the May 7 Board meeting, despite Sara Tindall Ghazal’s objections, and her misinformation that the 36 errors accounted for only hundreds of votes.</p>\n<p>McGowan was also involved in trying to stop a separate investigation into Raffensperger for the hand count errors, because Georgia statute places the responsibility with the Secretary of State office, which never forced Fulton County to update the results. When former State Election Board Chairman William Duffey asked about opening another investigation, McGowan replied, in an <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/McGowan-email-Rossi-complaint-copy.pdf\">email</a> sent July 21, 2023, \"I have instructed our investigations division that this office will not be opening up a case on this complaint.”</p>\n<p>Moncla and Rossi found the Batches Loaded Report sent to Macias the day after the recount only had 511,543 votes, far short of the 528,777 total of the first machine count. But that number wasn’t accurate, either. The complaint found the total from the first machine count, the original results, included 20,713 votes from 10 tabulators \"for which Fulton County has no records.” Meaning, the vote totals should have always been less.</p>\n<p>\"That is, the tabulators do not exist,” Moncla and Rossi wrote. \"There are no poll open tapes, no daily status tapes and no poll closing tapes. We submitted Open Records Requests to Fulton County specifically seeking the 10 tabulator tapes, but Fulton County responded by saying that they had ‘No such records.’”</p>\n<p>When it came time for the recount, that fact made replicating the results rather difficult.</p>\n<p>Hence the 17,852 missing ballot images and 3,125 duplicate ballot images that ended up in the certified second machine count results, totaling 20,977 unsubstantiated ballots. This figure is almost identical to the number of ballots, 20,713, that appeared from tabulators in the first count out of thin air. Some time in between when Barron sent the Batches Loaded Report to Macias and the results were certified on Dec. 4, 16,382 votes were added, for a total of 527,925, almost making up the shortfall.</p>\n<p>During the Fulton County Board <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LymShDFd9kA&amp;t=1840s\"><span>meeting</span></a> to certify the results, Barron admitted, under questioning from a Board member, they were \"short.” But he never said just how short they were.</p>\n<p>\"Once we start uploading all those results [to the Secretary of State], you’re looking at the final numbers, so you can see that it’s short,” Barron told the Board. \"And at that point the only thing you can do is go back and reconcile to see where those are. We were in touch with the state through that, and they told us on Thursday morning to go back and reconcile that before we went through certification.”</p>\n<p>Barron said he was \"in touch with the state,” but he did not say he was in touch with Macias. He also claimed the problem was because one of the scanners Fulton County had borrowed from DeKalb County was \"zeroed out” in the process of scanning absentee ballots, and thus created two identical sets of batch numbers from the same scanner, necessitating one set of the batches to be rescanned.</p>\n<p>\"Once that occurs there are only two ways you can do it, either you have to append those batches at the end or you can scan them on different scanners,” Barron said. \"So we used the different scanners rather than appending them on the end.”</p>\n<p>But that was not what Fulton County did. At least 49 batches of votes were added to seven of the same tabulators that were used before, beginning at 8:10 p.m. on Dec. 3, after the Batches Loaded Report was sent to Macias, and after the recount deadline had passed.</p>\n<p>McGowan attempted to borrow Barron’s inexplicable explanation for the missing ballots, without ever addressing the fact that the reports show they appended 5,119 votes to the seven tabulators. Still left unanswered, who put these results there?</p>\n<p>The state investigator’s report, which McGowan presented to the Board but did not release to the public, is even less plausible. Nadine Williams, the warehouse manager Barron put in charge of the recount, who is now the Fulton County Elections Director, said in a<a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Williams-Memo.pdf\"> memo</a> addressing the complaint dated May 2, 2024, the issue was a \"duplicate tabulator number.” \"In this case, two scanners were accidentally labeled identically” causing the first upload to be \"erased.” Yet, in the investigator report Williams contradicts herself and says it was the second set of batches that did not scan, not the first. Williams is quoted saying the scanner was \"programmed with the same tabulator and batch numbers” causing the software to \"interpret them as one” and reject the \"scanned ballots as a duplicate batch.”  There’s another problem: Dominion’s manual says all of this is impossible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_9345-3.heic\"></a></p>\n<p><span><span>Rossi and Moncla’s request for rebuttal, June 13, 2024</span></span></p>\n<p>The McGowan report claims this was all because of one high-speed scanner, tabulator 816, also identified as \"ICC 16.” Yet, the Batches Loaded Reports show at least seven tabulators had votes added to them on Dec. 3. And none of the votes attributed to tabulator 816 changed. Carter Jones, the Secretary of State monitor, said two scanners were named the same. Barron did not say two scanners were named the same, he said one machine was \"zeroed out” and created two identical sets of batch numbers.</p>\n<p>And this is not the same tabulator Barron said with which there was an issue. The day the machine recount was certified, he said it was ICC14, not 16. He also said there were 62 batches that had to be rescanned, not 97, which is what the McGowan report said. He also said the machine could only accept the first set of batches, not the second.</p>\n<p>So it was either one \"zeroed out” machine or a \"programming error,” two tabulators named the same, or just one that had the same batch numbers, it was either ICC16, or 14, with 62 batches or 97, it only accepted the first results or the first results were \"erased,” or the second batches were \"rejected,” all on a system Dominion says if you’re trying to load results from a tabulator that has already been loaded, it tells you, and you have to delete or purge the results. Or maybe they just needed an excuse to keep scanning, because they did not have enough votes. And they still cannot keep their story straight.</p>\n<p>Using tabulator 816 to explain away the 17,000 shortfall is the ultimate red herring. The Batches Loaded Report showed a total of only 511,543 votes. The state investigator report invented a new number, and said Fulton County only had 506,127 scanned ballots, rescanned 21,798 votes from tabulator 816, and ended up with 527,925 votes. Except those votes, the 21,798, were always included in the results. This was never the source of the shortfall. The state report does not even attempt to address why there were only 511,543 total votes.</p>\n<p>While trying to dismiss the importance of the Batches Loaded Reports, the state actually admitted that these reports were used as \"a reference in determining what the totals were and should have been.” In her memo, Williams said \"its primary function was to verify the scanned ballots.” Thus by their own admission, 511,543 ballots were scanned, they did not have enough, and sent the results to Ryan Macias to determine what the totals \"should have been.”</p>\n<p>\"However it was done,” Moncla and Rossi wrote, \"16,198 votes were in fact added to the recount between the time of Mr. Barron’s email to Ryan Macias at noon on December 3rd and the time of the [Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections] FCBRE meeting the following morning.”</p>\n<p>Barron never acknowledged the discrepancy was greater than the election margin, that the count was initially off by over 17,000 votes, and once that gap was nearly bridged, there were over 20,000 unsubstantiated votes within the total. These numbers were certified with the facts hidden from the public, President Trump, and his team, who were challenging the election.</p>\n<p>Mark Wingate, a Republican member of the Board, expressed displeasure at the discrepancy at the time, which he believed to be only 3,000 to 4,000 votes. Barron let the Board believe this false impression, rather than informing them the deficiency was over five times greater.</p>\n<p>\"We’ve counted these three different times, or you all have, Director,” Wingate said, \"you’ve gotten three different results every time that they’ve been counted.” Wingate pointed out that after each count, there were less and less votes.</p>\n<p>Mary Carole Cooney, the then-elections chairwoman, said the counts they certified were only \"slightly different,” and claimed that, as an attorney, \"really the gold standard is whether there is a discrepancy large enough to change the outcome of the race, and we are very far from that.”</p>\n<p>The discrepancy was, in fact, large enough to change the outcome of the Presidential Election. A more important question is, why was there such a large discrepancy in the first place? The most likely explanation is when Fulton County finished scanning, they did not have enough paper ballots to justify their original \"results.”</p>\n<p><strong><span>‘Unelected Until Proven Elected’</span></strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately, the certified results included 17,852 ballots without ballot images.</p>\n<p>It is not just Rossi and Moncla saying this. Philip Stark, a professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, and the brain behind the first risk-limiting audit in the nation, determined there were 17,752 ballot images missing.</p>\n<p>When Stark was brought in for the plaintiffs in the <span>Curling v. Raffensperger</span> lawsuit, a complicated and long-running legal battle to rid Georgia of touchscreen electronic voting machines (but not the equally vulnerable electronic tabulators), as an expert witness, his <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PHILIP_STARK_CGG_9-copy.pdf\">declaration</a> eviscerated Raffensperger’s hand count audit, which he called \"security theater.”</p>\n<p>Stark found the numbers of the counts differed so substantially at the precinct level — specifically President Trump’s votes from Election Day were undercounted by the machines twice — it left voters with no confidence their votes were \"counted at all, much less counted as cast.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In one Fulton County precinct of only roughly 4,200 total votes, President Trump’s Election Day totals were off by nearly 50 percent from the hand audit to the machine recount.</p>\n<p>Stark determined Georgia had no reconciliation process, no definite ballot manifest, or physical inventory of the paper ballots. The audit, then, was just the voting system \"checking itself.”</p>\n<p>This was the opposite of the intention of the risk-limiting audit Stark himself created.</p>\n<p>\"You start by assuming that the answer is wrong, you start by assuming that the reported winner didn’t really win,” Stark <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/11/22/566039611/colorado-launches-first-in-the-nation-post-election-audits\"><span>told </span></a>NPR in 2017. (A safe assumption in 2020.) \"Then you start saying ‘I’m going to collect evidence,’ and if the evidence becomes convincing that the winner really did win, I get to stop auditing.”</p>\n<p>As NPR put it, \"Unelected until proven elected, so to speak.”</p>\n<p>The evidence never became convincing Joe Biden won. Instead of questioning their own results, Georgia officials did not want any questions at all, and smeared anyone who dared ask. It was, like in all the Swing States, \"Elected, we won’t prove it, and shut up if you can prove otherwise.”</p>\n<p>McGowan now claims the state was able to come up with about 518,000 ballot images from Fulton County’s machine recount, though they refused to show this evidence to the public, or to the complainants. If true, this still makes Fulton County at least 9,925 ballot images short, nearly the entire election margin.</p>\n<p>Stark also confirmed there are at least 376,863 missing ballot images from the original results —  the entirety of all in-person early voting — something Fulton County claims is <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1787931381504307566?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>news to them</span></a>. (Dr. Johnston put the number at 380,761.) Stark examined the machine recount and concluded \"there is ample evidence” the same votes were counted multiple times, adding \"thousands of bogus votes to the reported machine-count results.”</p>\n<p>\"That is,” Stark said, \"thousands of Fulton County voters’ votes were included in the reported totals more than once.”</p>\n<p>This is something Gabriel Sterling said did not happen.</p>\n<p>Sterling was the \"voting system implementation manager” in 2020, a fancy title to cover up the fact he had left his job at the Secretary of State’s office before the presidential election to become an outside contractor with a $200,000 contract, <a href=\"https://nationalfile.com/georgia-secretary-of-state-paid-gabriel-sterlings-company-four-times-his-annual-salary-during-2020-election/\"><span>four times</span></a> his normal government salary.</p>\n<p>Sterling claimed the hand count audit \"proved” no ballots were scanned twice. Except that wasn’t true. The counts were entered into Arlo, a VotingWorks software system controlled by the Secretary of State’s office, and included <a href=\"https://x.com/jeffmfulgham/status/1718715958787743997\"><span>numerous duplicate batches</span></a>, that is, the same entries two or three times. These were discovered by Rossi and others and eventually confirmed by Gov. Kemp’s team in 2021. By February 2022, Raffensperger had to <a href=\"https://fyntv.com/2022/02/22/r-brad-raffensperger-ga-secretary-of-state-joins-bkp-politics/\"><span>admit</span></a> Fulton County was \"off by several thousand ballots” because \"they scanned some of those ballots twice.” But that is not what he told the Unselect Committee. When he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/21/1105848096/jan-6-committee-hearing-transcript\"><span>testified</span></a>, under oath, before Congress in June 2022, Raffensperger falsely stated the hand count audit \"came remarkably close to the first count.” The count included at least 6,000 votes (and likely a lot more) that should have never been there, including 4,081 false Biden votes, which has never been updated in the official hand count results. Sterling testified the hand count was \"dead on accurate.” Arlo was also <a href=\"https://www.voting.works/risk-limiting-audits\"><span>used</span></a> in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada in 2020.</p>\n<p>\"That audit showed that there was no problem with the machine scanning,” Sterling had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLYugNRVLiQ\"><span>claimed</span></a>. \"If somebody took a stack of ballots and scanned them multiple times, you would have a lot of votes with no corresponding ballots.”</p>\n<p>That could explain why <a href=\"https://voterga.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/notice-of-filing-exhibits.pdf\"><span>multiple witnesses</span></a> working as senior poll managers at the World Congress Center on Nov. 14, 2020 saw stacks and stacks of \"pristine,” unfolded mail-in ballots. In other words, they had vote totals, but not the ballots.</p>\n<p>The witnesses believed the ballots were photocopied and fraudulently added into the hand count (at 98 percent margins for the benefit of Joe Biden). This means batch entries during the audit were not only fraudulently entered more than once to get the numbers to \"match,” but thousands of the ballots themselves were not real either. The hand count audit was \"short,” too.</p>\n<p>Litigation surrounding these allegations is still hung up in court. Though the parties have been granted standing and a review of the ballots, that review has still not happened. Fulton County is now seeking to destroy the 2020 ballots before they can be seen, <a href=\"https://x.com/paulsperry_/status/1805796446953669087?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\">claiming</a> there is no room to store them, despite the fact they recently secured a 60,000 square foot warehouse at <a href=\"https://voterga.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Press-Release-Fulton-Co-Moves-to-Destroy-2020-Election-Ballots.pdf\">tremendous cost</a> to Atlanta taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what the Secretary of State and other Georgia officials have said, the three counts do not match.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>Rossi and Moncla’s request for rebuttal, June 13, 2024</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of the 17,852 missing ballot images from the machine recount, 13,390 went to Joe Biden and 4,319 went to President Trump, a 75 percent margin for Biden. There were also 107 votes for Jo Jorgensen, 34 blank votes, and two write-ins. Of the 3,125 duplicates, 1,565 went to Biden, 1,383 went to President Trump, 52 went to Jorgensen, and 16 were blank – almost a 50-50 split, almost as if they had gotten the margins they wanted, they just needed the totals to increase. Removing these false votes from each candidate’s total reduces the margin in the Presidential Election to just 2,526 votes.</p>\n<p>By removing the additional 4,081 false votes given to Biden in the hand count audit, the outcome of the 2020 Election is changed by just two investigations prompted by Moncla and Rossi. No wonder they did not want to take them \"that far.”</p>\n<p><strong><span>‘Above and Beyond’</span></strong></p>\n<p>They say the cover up is always worse than the crime, but that is questionable when the crime is stealing an election. Fulton County claimed the 10 missing tabulators responsible for over 20,000 unsubstantiated ballots from the original count, did, \"indeed exist,” and had poll managers sign affidavits attesting to the same. However, their \"proof” revealed they used serial numbers of <span>different</span> tabulators and <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1801972275970728065?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>proved</span></a> Fulton County’s results for early voting in 2020 were tampered with, and fraudulently printed out on different machines.</p>\n<p>Rossi and Moncla are seeking an opportunity to rebut the state’s claims at the May 7 hearing. They submitted a 44-page <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Request-for-Hearing-Complete-with-Factual-Response.pdf\">factual response</a> to the State Election Board on June 13. The response outlines how Fulton County appears to have forged the existence of the 10 tabulators, by using images of other tabulators. The machines they claim exist are not present on the county’s own checklists for early voting.</p>\n<p>What Fulton County inadvertently revealed is that the results from early voting were printed out on machines that did not tabulate the votes, in violation of numerous election statutes required to reconcile the results.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he Investigator’s Report failed to provide evidence as to the existence of the tabulators in question,” Rossi and Moncla wrote. \"What they did provide is evidence that the security seals for thirty-seven (37) Advance Voting tabulators were broken and the memory cards were unlawfully removed during a live election.”</p>\n<p>\"What our investigation has determined is that the memory cards of multiple tabulators were replaced with ones programmed with a different identity,” they wrote.</p>\n<p>For instance, a fourth ICP tabulator was invented at Wolf Creek Library, when according to the Logic and Accuracy checklist for the precinct there were only three tabulators. The open tape for \"ICP4” shows the same serial number as the third scanner. The closing tape for ICP 3, however, is unsigned (in violation of election rules), and has yet another serial number, one of 12 machines that were used to close out the entirety of the early voting \"results.”</p>\n<p>\nWhat Fulton County produced was a mismatch of some open tapes, some results tapes, but never one each for the same machine to reveal the history of its use during the election, and pictures of other scanners that they tried to pass off as the missing ones. They said they could not produce all records for the tabulators in question because of \"complicated” \"storage issues.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Johnston also requested information on the mystery tabulators, and said at least 150 pieces of information are still missing.</p>\n<p>\"I would consider this over 150 [election law] violations if these are not produced,” she said during the Board meeting.</p>\n<p>\"The complaint alleged that 10 tapes that should have been run the night of the Election or at the end of advanced voting were missing,” said Cathy Woolard, the chair of the Fulton County Board of Registrations and Elections. \"We have provided documentation that shows that those scanners existed, that they were taking votes, and that chain of custody, at least insofar as what happened at the precinct, was proper.</p>\n<p>\"We have given as much information as have been asked for,” she said. \"We have gone above and beyond.”</p>\n<p>In their pursuit of transparency from Fulton County and the state of Georgia, Moncla and Garland Favorito, the head of the election integrity group VoterGa, tried for months to obtain open tapes in order to reconcile the results. They are called zero tapes because their entire purpose is to make sure before the polls open that all candidates have zero votes. Out of over 500 tabulators used in the 2020 Election, they were only able to obtain nine zero tapes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fulton County has now provided seven more, and none were accompanied with a closing tape, and at least three revealed serial numbers for different machines. Moncla has since discovered closing tapes for entirely different polling locations, where results were supposedly closed on the same machine <em><span>at the same time</span></em>. If they are willing to fabricate evidence of tabulators, would they be willing to fabricate evidence of votes? Woolard is right. They did go above and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong><span>‘They chose Fulton County’</span></strong></p>\n<p>The name Ryan Macias was hardly mentioned on May 7, even though he is a central player in the allegations raised in the complaint. Why was the elections director of Fulton County sending election results to anyone outside Fulton County? More specifically, why was Richard Barron sending results — which were off by 17,000 votes — to a \"subject matter expert for CISA/DHS,” the same government agency that in 2020 was spying on Americans and creating an <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/cisa-staff-report6-26-23.pdf\"><span>unconstitutional censorship apparatus</span></a>, and which had already declared the quite obviously insecure 2020 Election the \"most secure in history”?</p>\n<p>Barron had been introduced to Macias several months before. Noah Praetz, the co-founder of the Elections Group who used to run elections in Cook County, Illinois (Yes, <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/2023/11/03/four-peat-chicago-ranks-no-1-corruption-report-finds\"><span>that</span></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/report/where-theres-smoke-theres-fire-100000-stolen-votes-chicago\"><span>Cook County</span></a>), informed Barron in early September 2020 that Macias would be joining their team on the ground in Fulton County, and would be \"extremely helpful in all of your technology related efforts.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Praetz noted Macias would assist Fulton County’s Emergency Operation Center, and \"some of the USDR stuff,” or United States Digital Response, which Fulton County <a href=\"https://fultoncountyga.gov/-/media/Departments/Registration-and-Elections/Board-of-Registration-and-Elections/BRE-PACKETS/BRE-PACKET-8122021.pdf\"><span>worked</span></a> with to create a portal in 2020 to \"aid us in absentee ballot processing and delivery.” Fulton County disputed the complainants who said Macias was not employed by the county, and said he \"served” as a consultant during the 2020 Election.</p>\n<p>Emails from Fulton County showed the Elections Group itself appeared out of thin air.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The Elections Group came to us on a grant,” the open records office in Fulton County wrote in an email to Moncla in December 2021. \"No agreement was signed with them. They were paid by the Elections Group. The county paid zero for them to be here. They chose Fulton County.”</p>\n<p>The arrangement was an unusual one. The three-page memorandum attached to the investigative report providing \"proof” Macias was a contractor shows he was not paid, and shows the Elections Group was involved in Fulton County even earlier than September. The <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Elections-Group-Fulton-County-Memorandum-of-Understanding.pdf\">agreement</a> signed between Praetz and Fulton County Manager Richard Anderson, who formerly ran the Federal Reserve as COO, was for $1.00. Notably, the line for the Department of Registration and Elections to sign was left blank. In exchange for this \"consulting fee,” the Elections Group would provide four people: a full-time former elections official for \"deep management,” a full-time technician as an \"onsite team support analyst,” a part-time project manager, and a \"part-time senior level election consultant.” How nice of them.</p>\n<p>Who is Ryan Macias? He was the Election Assistance Commission’s top tech expert who controlled how electronic voting systems were certified and decertified before he <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/election-assistance-commission-loses-key-tech-expert-ahead-2020/\"><span>abruptly left</span></a> in May 2019. His leaving was seen as a blow to the agency ahead of the 2020 Election, as he was in the middle of overseeing an \"important update to voting system security guidelines.” Macias <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/15/federal-election-brian-newby-2020-1365841\"><span>reportedly</span></a> left the EAC because of the management style of its then executive director, Brian Newby, a Republican, who was the subject of several hit pieces in Politico in 2019, citing unnamed \"former election officials, former federal employees, and others.” I.e. hacks from the Obama Administration.</p>\n<p>Prior to working for the federal government, Macias spent a decade working in California’s elections. He contributed to a <a href=\"https://sfgov.org/lafco/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/56719-FINAL%20-%20Increasing%20Voter%20Participation%20in%20San%20Francisco%207-29-16%20.pdf\"><span>report</span></a> released in July 2016 on how to increase voter turnout in San Francisco, providing research about states that switched to all voting by mail, four years before the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2020, with his own election consulting firm and with the Elections Group, Macias would <a href=\"https://www.abc15.com/news/state/secretary-of-state-gets-observers-inside-maricopa-county-election-audit-cyber-ninjas-has-to-reveal-methods\"><span>appear</span></a> in the most pivotal locations, Fulton County, Georgia and Maricopa County, Arizona. Two Ground Zeroes of the stolen election.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>Elections Battle Staff Playbook, Belfer Center</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Macias helped write the \"<a href=\"https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/Battle%20Staff.pdf\"><span>Elections Battle Staff playbook</span></a>,” which was published in December 2019 and laid out a plan to coordinate \"election operations” between states. The Harvard University-created playbook included a coordination food chain where a \"Federal Battle Staff” works top down with state agencies, governors, all the way to the county level, to then coordinate with the media, NGOs, political organizations, law enforcement, and the elections IT department. You begin to see how an election can be so well \"<a href=\"https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/\"><span>fortified</span></a>” for the powers that be.</p>\n<p>Macias also contributed to the 2018 playbook, which <a href=\"https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/state-and-local-election-cybersecurity-playbook\"><span>included </span></a>players in the Russia collusion hoax, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook and Crowdstrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch on its senior advisory group.</p>\n<p>Macias and Praetz gave a joint <a href=\"https://www.iaccr.net/PDF/iaccrseptemberpresentation.pdf\"><span>presentation</span></a> to CISA in September 2019, before the Elections Group was created and before COVID, on how to \"increase engagement and support provided to local election officials.” Macias spoke on how CISA could provide resources to election officials and \"technology providers” to \"#PROTECT2020.” Praetz’s portion of the presentation was, ironically, on \"election interference” and \"disinformation.”</p>\n<p>The presentation’s theme was \"CISA Gears Up for 2020 Election Security.” Yet just a few months later, the presenters were teaching local officials in Swing States how to bring in drop boxes and rapidly increase mail-in ballots, a form of voting so insecure it has been banned in France <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3666259\"><span>since 1975.</span></a></p>\n<p>The Elections Group claimed it was created in \"early 2020” to assist with \"massive changes to election plans” because of Covid, according to its website, in a page it has since <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201020033226/https://electionsgroup.com/leadership-team.html\"><span>memory-holed</span></a>. On March 26, 2020, just 11 days into the COVID lockdowns, there was already a \"National Task Force on Election Crises,” ready to release \"guidance” on \"<a href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/national-task-force-covid-19/\"><span>How to Protect Elections in the Age of COVID-19</span></a>.” Naturally, the group recommended \"Expanding no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail,” \"Maximizing early voting days and hours,” and \"Increasing the number of polling places and other voting options.” All of these methods were exploited in 2020, and not just to stuff the ballot box, but to make it easier, with a near total lack of chain of custody, to move the numbers around.</p>\n<p>Members of the so-called \"cross-partisan” task force included Macias, Jennifer Morell, the other co-founder of the Elections Group, and a who’s who of the deep state, including Jim Baker, the former FBI general counsel who was involved in the illegitimate warrants to spy on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, and Mary McCord, who oversaw the collusion hoax investigation at the Justice Department. These efforts are always <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/us/politics/republican-governors-trump-kemp.html\"><span>cross-partisan</span></a>.</p>\n<p>The task force was convened by Protect Democracy, a liberal group co-founded by the associate White House Counsel under Barack Obama, which later would provide legal counsel to Ruby Freeman after she was <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/january-6th-committee-witness-testimony-20220531-ruby-freeman/page/26/mode/1up\"><span>told to leave her home</span></a> by the FBI.</p>\n<p>The Elections Group said its purpose was to provide \"mentorship and materials” to election officials. They created <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201020022530/https://electionsgroup.com/our-work.html\"><span>guides</span></a> to ballot drop boxes, with animated <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201101054928/https://healthypolls.stanford.edu/resources/ballot-box-retrieval-process\"><span>videos</span></a> on how to collect ballots from them while wearing a mask. Praetz and Morell \"recruited a deep bench of experts around the nation who could lend a hand” for their <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201020033226/https://electionsgroup.com/superheroes-project.html\"><span>Election Superheroes Project</span></a>, an effort which has since been erased from the Internet, but was cited in the contract signed with Fulton County.</p>\n<p>The Elections Group’s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201202114814/https://electionsgroup.com/partners.html\"><span>partners</span></a> included the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a Mark Zuckerberg nonprofit used to subvert the election by funneling millions into Democrat cities, and the National Vote at Home Institute, which for years prior to 2020 pushed for universal mail-in voting. The Elections Group gave its \"deepest thanks” to CTCL and others for helping them \"leverage existing technology, tools and research to facilitate solutions for election officials.” Solutions for problems, like say, being over 17,000 ballots short during a recount.</p>\n<p>Members of the Election Group essentially ran elections in multiple Swing States. They \"chose Fulton County” and helped \"keep the warehouse running,” where they were abreast with the schedules of election workers, including lunch and dinner breaks.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>An Elections Group representative was <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_9328.heic\">seen</a> \"printing ballots for no apparent reason” on Nov. 1, 2020 at 10 p.m. Praetz instructed Fulton to have test mailings \"so we can monitor ballot mailing time across the country.” In a separate email in September, Praetz told Barron that Macias had \"worked closely with Runbeck over the years and we have some ideas on your mailing of ballots.” Fulton County would order <a href=\"https://uncoverdc.com/2021/10/25/fulton-county-massive-last-minute-order-of-over-1m-ballots-discovered\"><span>over 1 million mail-in ballots</span></a>, <span>after</span> they could have been sent to voters. These orders were separate from what Runbeck Election Services was already sending directly to voters, and amounted to more than the entirety of the number of registered voters in Fulton County. Runbeck is also the main vendor used in Arizona.</p>\n<p>They were just here to help. Running the warehouse, <a href=\"https://x.com/kevinmoncla/status/1767119450002563473?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>performing </span></a>Logic &amp; Accuracy testing, and <a href=\"https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/SOS7HillStrategyFultonCountyNotes.pdf\"><span>on hand</span></a> throughout the whole counting process. Think of the unsolicited call you get from what looks like the same 1-800 number as your bank. They’re from IT, and they’re going to make it so you never fall prey to fraudsters again. Of course their solution involves you giving them all the vital information to your bank account, and the next thing you know, all the money is gone</p>\n<p><strong><span>The ‘Heroes of the Process’</span></strong></p>\n<p>When trying to get answers out of McGowan and the state investigators, Dr. Johnston became perplexed.</p>\n<p>\"I’m trying to get to the point of finding evidence that 17,852 ballots actually exist,” she said. \"So, there either need to be ballot images or we need to go look at the paper ballots…let’s look at the paper ballots.”</p>\n<p>McGowan, though she said the proof was in the paper ballots, said no.</p>\n<p>When CISA <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20November%203rd%20election%20was,elections,%20many%20will%20recount%20ballots\"><span>declared</span></a> 2020 the most secure election in history, the same statement said election officials were still checking their results. Any question of those results — which were still being checked — they said, were \"unfounded.” How could they know, unless the outcome was predetermined? And what exactly, then, were they checking? CISA also said everyone could have full faith in the system because there were \"paper records of each vote.”</p>\n<p>That’s exactly what McGowan said on May 7. She dismissed the idea of needing ballot images, because the \"ballot image is not the vote, it is merely the electronic picture of the ballot so that we can go back and people can review them.” Except, in a country that counts its paper ballots by machine, <a href=\"https://votescount.santacruzcountyca.gov/Portals/16/New%20voting%20system/AuditMark%20Brochure%20-%20final.pdf\"><span>ballot images </span></a><span>are</span> how a vote is counted. How is a machine supposed to count the vote, if it did not take an image of that paper ballot first?</p>\n<p>Nearly four years later, the questions are still there, and the unconvincing answers are the same. Trust the paper ballots that you cannot see, counted by a system that has no reconciliation, no accountability, and that checks itself. There’s a reason why Fulton County Board of Elections members <a href=\"https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1793660622393250075?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w\"><span>aren’t allowed to see their own election results</span></a>.</p>\n<p>\"The 2020 Election underwent meticulous scrutiny through hand counts, recounts, and court challenges,” said Nadine Williams, \"but the story remains steadfast; the outcome remains consistent.”</p>\n<p>The story of 2020 goes like this. People who ran some of the most corrupt election systems in the country, in California and Cook County, somehow ended up running the elections in the cities of the most important Swing States in the most important election in history. They were experts in the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.240678/gov.uscourts.gand.240678.1681.0.pdf\"><span>easily manipulated </span></a>electronic systems, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/04/709911541/georgia-governor-signs-law-addressing-some-criticisms-of-contested-2018-election\"><span>mandated</span></a> in Georgia ahead of the 2020 Election, and <a href=\"https://www.wabe.org/to-encourage-mail-in-voting-in-may-georgia-will-send-applications-to-all-registered-voters/\"><span>flush</span></a> with malleable mail-in votes. After the corrupt news media falsely declared Biden the winner, officials were \"double checking the entire election process” just like Georgia \"checked” the machine recount to investigate the complaint. All they really checked was the box to remove President Trump from office – and try to cover their tracks. It didn’t matter what the results truly were. They never had the votes. 2020 wasn’t an election, it was a cover up.</p>\n<p>When it was all said and done, Stanford University put together an \"<a href=\"https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/2020-elections-oral-history-project-peaceful-transition\"><span>election oral history,</span></a>” a propaganda piece that commended the \"heroes of the process.” Among those acknowledged: Jocelyn Benson (Michigan), Kathy Boockvar (Pennsylvania), Chris Krebs (CISA), Katie Hobbs (Arizona), Meagan Wolfe (Wisconsin), and Gabriel Sterling (Georgia). The last name on the list was Ryan Macias.</p>\n<p><span><span>\"T</span></span>he job wasn’t done until January 20, 2021,” <a href=\"https://youtu.be/069iFGY9Mo0\"><span>said</span></a> Chris Krebs, noting the date when Biden (illegitimately) took office. \"Thats where, for me, that was the relief, the burden off the shoulders that, ‘Hey, we did this.’”</p>\n<p>Krebs said 2016, or the election of Donald J. Trump, had been a \"wake up call.” \"The United States needed to rethink its approach to protecting elections,” the <a href=\"https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/content/2020-elections-oral-history-project-how\"><span>oral history</span></a> states. So CISA got the EAC, the FBI, secretaries of states, state election directors, the International Association of Government Officials, and \"private sector entities like voting system and voter registration providers” together. They wanted to control the election, and they did. And they never want to give up control again.</p>\n<p>Rather than answer the uncomfortable questions laid before them, like the fact that there are still over 150 missing pieces of information (amounting to 150 violations of election law) from the 10 mystery scanners Fulton County claims they found, the chair demurred.</p>\n<p>\"We are running an election now, we will be running an election in November,” said Cathy Woolard. \"And doing what’s right in 2024 is more important than rehashing 2020.”</p>\n<p>Yet, that is all Fulton County, and the nation, has done. The same top-down controlled, corrupt, fraudulent, covered up voting system, a system no one trusts, and oftentimes, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-primaries-discrepancies-voting-problems-machines-8019db17829c7b1fbae5fb3fde623a4b\"><span>doesn’t even work</span></a>, is being presented again and again for us to vote on, without any meaningful change or improvement. Every election is another rehash of 2020. If they truly want to do what’s right in 2024, they will do what’s right about Nov. 3.</p>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Wednesday morning press conference led by U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), members of Congress outlined their grievances and constitutional foundations for holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt. The central issue concerns Garland’s refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena demanding audio recordings from President Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The lawmakers emphasized that this refusal undermines the legislative branch’s authority and disrupts the balance of power envisioned by the Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Garland, hand over the recordings,” Luna <a href=\"https://x.com/RepLuna/status/1805429218852909203\">posted</a> on her social media earlier in the week ahead of the presser.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Luna discussed the potential arrest of Attorney General Merrick Garland as part of enforcing Congress’s authority through <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artIII-S1-4-3/ALDE_00013522/\">inherent contempt</a>. Luna emphasized that if Garland fails to comply with the congressional subpoena, Congress has the constitutional power to act.</p>\n<p>Luna stated, “We are asking that he bring in the tapes, but in the event that he does not, we will press forward with calling the privileged motion on inherent contempt to the floor on Friday morning.” She further clarified the implications of this action: “This is something that again would enable the Speaker of the House to order the Sergeant-at-Arms to take into custody the Attorney General if he fails to comply with our request.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Luna highlighted the constitutional basis for Congress’s authority to enforce compliance with its subpoenas, referencing the historical use of inherent contempt.</p>\n<p>“Inherent contempt is clearly within our Article 1 authorities,” Luna stated, emphasizing Congress’s power to investigate and the necessity of enforcing compliance to maintain its status as a co-equal branch of government. She cited the <a href=\"https://law-journals-books.vlex.com/vid/mcgrain-daugherty-52031300#:~:text=In%201927%20the%20U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20issued%20a,information%20by%20requiring%20private%20citizens%20to%20give%20testimony.\">1927 Supreme Court case McGrain v. Daugherty</a>, which affirmed Congress’s investigative authority, to underscore the legal precedent supporting their actions.</p>\n<p>The press conference also addressed broader concerns about the Biden administration’s conduct, particularly regarding weaponizing governmental powers for political purposes.</p>\n<p>Rep. Dan Francis (R-FL) criticized the administration, saying, “The sad legacy of the Biden administration will be its weaponizing of government against political enemies and undermining the law for cynical politics.” He accused the administration of circumventing laws, such as those related to immigration and executive amnesty, and using executive power to shield allies while targeting dissenters.</p>\n<p>Rep. Mark Alford (R-MO) pointed out the DOJ’s refusal to prosecute Garland despite the House’s vote to hold him in criminal contempt. “The executive branch can simply ignore Congress without any consequences,” Alford warned, “it threatens the very function and foundation of our democratic process.” He outlined the options available to Congress—criminal, civil, or inherent contempt—highlighting that both criminal and civil contempt rely on the executive branch for enforcement, which was not feasible in this case.</p>\n<p>Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-WY) underscored the necessity of inherent contempt as a constitutional enforcement mechanism, stressing its historical use and judicial backing. “Inherent contempt has been used by the U.S. House of Representatives more than a hundred times since 1795 and upheld by the Supreme Court,” she explained. She argued that without the ability to enforce subpoenas, Congress’s oversight functions would be significantly weakened, reducing subpoenas to mere formal requests rather than constitutionally based demands for information.</p>\n<p>Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) elaborated on the broader implications of the administration’s actions, framing them as a disregard for the rule of law and an encroachment on legislative powers. He condemned the administration’s handling of immigration and student loan relief, portraying these actions as unlawful overreach that Congress must counteract. “Joe Biden intentionally disobeyed the Supreme Court… and opened up the borders, leading to criminal activities,” Hunt stated, emphasizing the need for congressional action to uphold constitutional duties.</p>\n<p>The lawmakers repeatedly emphasized that their efforts are not partisan but rooted in the constitutional mandate to maintain a balance of power. They argued that the refusal to comply with subpoenas reflects a broader trend of executive overreach that must be checked to preserve the integrity of the legislative branch.</p>\n<p>Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) summed up the sentiment by stating, “Congress is supposed to be a regulatory authority over the executive branch, not the other way around. The founding fathers had it right. This administration is arrogantly thumbing its nose at the American people. It’s wrong, and we need to correct it.”</p>\n<p>Luna reported on her social media that she is hopeful about a Friday vote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Press conference tomorrow at 8am being sponsored by Fox. I’ve spoken to many members, yet have not heard anyone say they will vote to table this motion.</p>\n<p>Pressing forward with the vote to hold Garland in inherent contempt of Congress on Friday.</p>\n<p>— Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (@RepLuna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepLuna/status/1805789581926687193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Watch:</p>\n<h1>Rep.

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a surprising twist, House Republicans, led by Chairman Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) of the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight, are intensifying their efforts to challenge the legitimacy of the January 6th Select Committee. Coordinated actions by House Republicans come in response to recent developments surrounding the prosecution of former Trump advisors Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, both sentenced for contempt of Congress related to the committee’s investigations.</p>\n<p>\"My Committee has spent the past year and a half turning over every rock, examining every shred of evidence, and investigating the entirety of operations of Vice-chair Liz Cheney and Chair Bennie Thompson’s Select Committee on January 6th,” Loudermilk told the Caller about his findings, adding:</p>\n<p>\"We have resoundingly discovered they were not completely truthful with the American people. They had little regard for House rules and no regard for transparency. They surpressed key pieces of evidence, cherry-picked evidence that supported their narrative, and played a 20 Million dollar blame-game to frame President Trump and Republicans.”</p>\n<p>On Tuesday night, the Speaker confirmed that significant actions would be taken on behalf of Steve Bannon, the host of the WarRoom program.</p>\n<p>The action from Republicans is unfolding just days before Bannon is ordered to surrender himself to federal prison to serve a four-month sentence.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Jim Banks (R-IN) set the stage with a pointed letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), expressing gratitude for supporting Loudermilk’s investigation into the committee’s conduct. Banks criticized the committee for alleged partisan biases, procedural violations, and issues with its subpoenas, highlighting discrepancies from traditional congressional norms and raising concerns over evidence destruction. He specifically urged support for an amicus brief to aid Bannon’s appeal, emphasizing fairness and procedural integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Read the Banks letter: <a href=\"https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bannon_ltr_real_final.pdf\">bannon_ltr_real_final</a></strong></p>\n<p>These efforts culminated in the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) voting 3-2 to officially declare the Jan. 6 Committee and all its subpoenas as illegitimate, exposing a deepening partisan divide over the committee’s actions and setting the stage for a significant legal confrontation.</p>\n<p>In a move that further escalated the conflict, BLAG directed the House Office of General Counsel to file an amicus brief supporting Bannon’s appeal to the Supreme Court. This decision aligns with Loudermilk’s stance that the committee’s actions lacked legal grounding, particularly noting violations of House rules concerning consultation with minority members.</p>\n<p>In anticipation of filing the amicus brief, Loudermilk referred to his committee’s findings that the Jan. 6 Committee operated with insufficient transparency and allegedly suppressed critical evidence. He pointedly criticized the committee’s methods as partisan and manipulative, aiming to frame President Trump and Republicans without factual basis.</p>\n<p>Loudermilk’s office clarified that the appointment of Vice Chair Liz Cheney did not meet the legal requirement of consulting with a ranking member from the minority party, reinforcing the argument of procedural irregularities in the committee’s operations. The Vice-Chair is not the ranking member, and Cheney was selected by former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Loudermilk’s office told the media.</p>\n<p>The significance of these developments extends beyond Bannon’s case, reflecting broader Republican discontent with the committee’s authority and methods left by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Loudermilk hinted at forthcoming legislation nullifying the committee’s work, underscoring ongoing efforts to challenge its legitimacy in legal and legislative arenas.</p>\n<p>The Bannon case highlights a pivotal moment for increased congressional oversight and the limits of legislative authority, which Bannon’s program, WarRoom, will discuss as events develop.</p>\n<p>Watch Speaker Johnson and Sean Hannity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BREAKING: Speaker Johnson tells Hannity that the House is working on an amicus brief in Steve Bannon’s appellate case:</p>\n<p>\"The January 6th Committee was wrongfully constituted, we think their work was tainted, we think that they may have very well covered up evidence and maybe even… <a href=\"https://t.co/NdghWswNyQ\">pic.twitter.com/NdghWswNyQ</a></p>\n<p>— VISH BURRA  (@VishBurra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VishBurra/status/1805775326997627275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n"

    "content": "\n<div>\n<p>In a Tuesday WarRoom discussion, Gina Swoboda, Carolina Wren, and Steve Bannon strongly emphasized the perceived security issues and alleged biases within the Maricopa County election system. They discussed the arrest of Walter Ringfield Jr., a temporary election worker, for stealing a key fob and security lanyard, which were deemed crucial for accessing and potentially manipulating election equipment.</p>\n<p>Bannon and Wren highlighted their skepticism about the narrative provided by the mainstream media, pointing out discrepancies in how Ringfield’s political affiliations and actions were reported. She mentioned that Ringfield, once a registered Democrat involved with a left-wing NGO, had his social media wiped clean except for a Truth Social account, raising suspicions about FBI involvement. Wren said, “The only person who can delete and wipe someone’s social media accounts while they’re in a jail cell is the FBI.”</p>\n<p>As the Arizona GOP chair, Swoboda emphasized the lack of communication from Maricopa County officials about the incident and the potential security risks. She criticized the response time and transparency, stating, “They didn’t notify us and they didn’t notify the public… if there’s a security risk, you have to tell the party and the campaigns.”</p>\n<p>Swoda called for immediate legal action and more aggressive measures to ensure election integrity, noting Arizona’s critical importance in national elections: “If we don’t win Arizona, we don’t win the presidency.”</p>\n<p>Bannon pushed for urgency and action, criticizing the response’s perceived passivity so far. He advocated for more proactive measures, including pressuring the local prosecutor’s office and ensuring robust legal representation to address these concerns effectively.</p>\n<p>Watch these segments for more context on their point of view:</p>\n<h1>BOMBSHELL: Maricopa County Hides Voting Security Risks On Election Day</h1>\n<h1>Democrat Advocate And Election Worker ARRESTED In Maricopa County, AZ</h1>\n<p>During a press conference on Tuesday to address the arrest,  Maricopa County, AZ Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates and other election supervisors addressed the recent security breach involving the temporary election worker who stole the key fob.</p>\n<p>They emphasized that the incident would not affect the upcoming primary election, with one official stating, “We reprogrammed all of the tabulators again, these are just calculators used on Election Day, and then we did the logic and accuracy test. It should not have any impact whatsoever on the primary.”</p>\n<p>Law enforcement’s quick response was praised. “The suspect was arrested the day that we determined it was missing, and the black security key was recovered again on the same day,” Gates said.</p>\n<p>This prompt action, they said, “should instill even more confidence in folks out in the community.”</p>\n<p>Gates detailed the county’s security protocols, which include criminal background checks for all temporary employees. However, they acknowledged limitations, explaining, “We do a criminal background check and when we did that criminal background check, we did not find this; he was on diversion.”</p>\n<p>They reassured the public of their commitment to election security, stating, “You can’t put a price on democracy and election security.”</p>\n<p>Addressing concerns about potential misuse of the stolen key, they clarified, “This black security key is part of a multi-layered process to essentially turn on the tabulators on Election Day. With this alone, no nefarious actors would be able to turn on the tabulation machine.”</p>\n<p>In response to fears of new conspiracy theories, a supervisor remarked, “I certainly hope that people don’t take this incident to spin up new conspiracy theories, but that’s exactly why the sheriff and I are here today to answer these questions.” The officials concluded by reaffirming their commitment to transparency and security, vowing to “act strongly” against any threats to the integrity of the elections.</p>\n<p>Watch the press conference:</p>\n<h1>LIVE: Maricopa County officials provide update on arrest of election worker</h1>\n</div>\n"
