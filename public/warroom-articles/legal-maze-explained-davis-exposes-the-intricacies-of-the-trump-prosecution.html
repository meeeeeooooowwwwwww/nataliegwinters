<p>On Friday, Steve Bannon and Mike Davis of the Article 3 Project appeared on the WarRoom to discuss the intricacies of the ongoing legal battle surrounding President Trump, who is a presidential candidate for 2024.</p>
<p>Davis’s most significant push was for Congress to step up faster and play harder to protect Trump and the rule of law saying they had the authority to do so, and there was no one stopping them</p>
<p>Here is some of what he told Bannon:</p>
<p>Together, they discussed the corruption surrounding Former Democrat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email server scandal and Democrat Hunter Biden’s laptop, highlighting an unequal application of laws about classified documents when dealing wth Republican President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Davis, in his Friday discussion with Bannon, accused Clinton of grave illegal actions and suggested that even though she destroyed hard drives that held highly sensitive classified documents that she had no right to have, that doesn’t mean someone else doesn’t have a copy of the documents that she illegally held.</p>
<p>Yet she has never had any consequences. Neither has Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>Davis blamed much of the unequal justice to media censorship in shaping public perception on these issues, and he questioned judicial integrity and called for transparency in handling sensitive information.</p>
<p>The question is, why are Democrats Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Hunter Biden allowed to have scandalous amounts of susceptible documents in their possession, and Republican Donald Trump is being prosecuted for having classified documents he IS allowed to have?</p>
<p>Bannon and Davis say that is because of a criminal conspiracy against Trump to deny him his civil rights.</p>
<p><strong>HILLARY CLINTON AND HUNTER BIDEN HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE </strong></p>
<p>Here are some points Davis made to Bannon:</p>
<p><strong> Hillary Clinton’s Email Server Scandal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clinton’s illegal home server contained classified secrets and evidence of the Clinton Foundation’s foreign bribery schemes.</li>
<li>Despite attempts to destroy evidence, the server was likely hacked by foreign entities, including China and Russia.</li>
<li>The Obama administration feared the exposure of Clinton’s corruption before the 2016 election, leading to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hunter Biden’s Laptop Controversy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Like Clinton’s case, allegations of foreign corruption surrounded Hunter Biden’s laptop.</li>
<li>The CIA and former Intel officials labeled it as Russian disinformation, leading to censorship by significant media outlets.</li>
<li>President Trump filed a civil lawsuit against Hillary Clinton for Russian collusion, revealing judicial bias and conflicts of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Maneuvers and Unanswered Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhardt’s recusal from Trump’s lawsuit against Clinton raised suspicions of bias.</li>
<li>The lack of privacy review and withholding of Crossfire Hurricane records underlined government opacity and potential cover-ups.</li>
<li>The Mar-a-lago raid symbolized the misuse of legal instruments to target political adversaries, emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Davis’s parallels between Clinton’s email scandal and the Hunter Biden laptop controversy underscore systemic problems within the entire judicial system. On Friday, he emphasized the urgency of the US House addressing judicial bias and government overreach to uphold democratic principles.</p>
<p>Davis clearly showed the importance of public awareness of these topics because the media does not explain these complex issues to Americans.</p>
<p>Davis also points to Joe Biden having an instrumental part in designing the lawfare against Trump to cover up and to persecute Trump and deny Trump his civil rights:</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of key points discussed, along with essential quotes and the full interview is below:</p>

</ul>
<p>3. <strong>Davis pushes for bolder Republican response</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Davis applauds Republican politicians for starting to show backbone but emphasizes the need for more action.</li>
<li>He calls for indictments to cut off federal funding to states and local governments prosecuting Trump.</li>
<li><em>Quote: “It’s good to see that these Republican politicians… are starting to find their backbones, but a lot more needs to be done.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <strong>Davis urges more urgency for House Republicans</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Davis urges House Republicans to issue aggressive subpoenas for witnesses and documents to uncover the conspiracy against Trump.</li>
<li>He stresses the need for public hearings and staff depositions to expose the truth.</li>
<li><em>Quote: “Let’s start bringing in these witnesses and their documents… and then fight it in court.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>5.</em><strong> Davis defines the situation as a Criminal Conspiracy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Davis accuses the Biden White House and various state officials of engaging in a criminal conspiracy against Trump.</li>
<li>He calls for action from House Republicans to combat this conspiracy.</li>
<li><em>Quote: “This is a criminal conspiracy… It’s a zero-sum game, and they are on offense.”</em></li>

</ul>

<li>Davis points out the misuse of legal processes, such as the Espionage Act, to target Trump and cover up the Obama-Biden administration’s wrongdoing.</li>
