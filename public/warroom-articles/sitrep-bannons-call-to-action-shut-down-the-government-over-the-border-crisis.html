<p><strong>Steve Bannon’s persistent push to shut down the U.S. government until the illegal immigration crisis is under control is back in focus as the nation grapples with escalating chaos in towns like Springfield, Ohio. <a href="https://x.com/TaylerUSA/status/1833860464629194931">Reports</a> of illegal immigrants allegedly capturing pets for food have horrified citizens and reignited the urgency of Bannon’s America First agenda. Bannon’s previous call to action, urging Speaker Mike Johnson and the House of Representatives to act, resonates strongly now as he sits imprisoned, unable to personally deliver his message. It’s up to the WarRoom posse to remind the American people: shut down the government, close the border, and elect Trump.</strong></p>
<h4>The Immigration Crisis: A National Struggle</h4>
<p>The crisis at the U.S. southern border is at a breaking point, with millions of illegal immigrants flooding into the country under the Biden-Harris administration’s open border policies. This has led to what Steve Bannon and his supporters see as a calculated invasion designed to destabilize the nation’s economy, safety, and cultural integrity. Over nine million illegal immigrants have crossed into the U.S. since President Biden took office, posing significant threats to working-class wages, minority communities, and national security.</p>
<p>This is no accident, according to Bannon, who believes the globalists—those loyal to Davos and multinational corporations—are engineering this crisis to destroy the very fabric of America. His solution? Immediate mass deportations and a firm shutdown of all government operations until Congress takes control of the borders.</p>
<h4>Bannon’s Year-Old Warning: Shut It Down</h4>
<p>In a 2023 speech at Turning Point Action, Bannon made a bold appeal to the House of Representatives, warning that if immigration wasn’t addressed, the government must be shut down. His commentary in the video clip below, referencing videos of President Trump calling for deportations, still rings true today. Bannon emphasized that every one of the nine million illegal immigrants must be deported—not just criminals or those from mental institutions. He argued that mass illegal immigration would crush the wages of African-American and Hispanic communities, leaving the working class without a future.</p>
<p>“This is treason,” Bannon declared, urging voters to wake up to the severity of the invasion. He also referenced an 85-year-old civil rights leader from Chicago who demanded justice during a public hearing on immigration, highlighting the grassroots outrage across the nation.</p>
<h4>The Long Road Ahead: Decades of Damage</h4>
<p>According to Bannon, the damage caused by the Biden administration’s policies will take 30-40 years to repair. His solution is clear: first, bring Trump back to power to secure the borders and withdraw from dangerous international agreements, like those with the United Nations, which support open borders. Only then can the U.S. begin to heal from the harm inflicted by years of globalist-driven chaos.</p>
<p>In his speech, Bannon stressed that fixing America won’t happen overnight, even under Trump. “Make America Great Again” isn’t a one-term solution. Instead, it will require continuous efforts, with Trump leading the way for successive MAGA presidents. He warned, however, that the road to recovery will be long and grueling, filled with economic challenges exacerbated by reckless spending and weak border policies.</p>
<h4>The Battle Continues: November Election Looming</h4>
<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Bannon’s message is more relevant than ever. The illegal immigration crisis has only worsened, and Bannon’s call to shut down the government remains a rallying cry for populists and nationalists alike. With Steve Bannon imprisoned as a political prisoner, his supporters have taken up the mantle to keep his message alive.</p>
<p>The WarRoom posse knows what Bannon would say today: shut the government down until the border is under control. Elect Trump to lead the charge. This election represents a critical moment in American history, one that could decide the future of the Republic for the next 30-40 years.</p>
<h4>Bannon’s Vision Lives On</h4>
<p>Steve Bannon may be behind bars as a political prisoner of the Biden-Harriss weaponized Department of Justice, but his vision for America continues to resonate with millions of citizens who believe that securing the border is the first step to reclaiming the nation’s sovereignty. The fight ahead is tough, but as Bannon emphasized, there is no compromise. Shut down the border or shut down the government and re-elect President Trump and America First candidates all over the country until the Amerian people are safe and free again.</p>
