<p>In a passionate Saturday morning WarRoom segment, Royce White, a former NBA player turned political candidate, defended himself against recent criticisms and expanded on his vision for America’s future.</p>
<p>Known for his outspoken views and unfiltered rhetoric, White, who secured the Republican nomination this week to run for US Senate, addressed allegations that he made derogatory remarks about women, explicitly referring to some women as being “mouthy.”</p>
<p>White quickly addressed the controversy surrounding his comments about women. He acknowledged that his words had been misinterpreted by some, but he stood by his original statement, insisting that his criticism was not about gender but about ideology.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“When I said some women are getting mouthy, I wasn’t talking about all women. I was talking about those who are out here pushing Marxism and Communism, trying to destroy the very fabric of our nation,” White explained. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He emphasized that his concern is with the growing influence of these ideologies, which he believes are antithetical to American values like freedom and liberty.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: IS WHITE WRONG?  ANSWER: NO-WHITE IS NOT WRONG. </strong></p>
<p><strong>CONSIDER THIS: </strong></p>
<p>While it would be overly simplistic to claim that the Marxist-Communist movement is exclusively dominated by progressive women, there are certain factors that contribute to the perception that women, particularly those with progressive views, have a significant presence in leftist activism.</p>
<p><strong>Representation in Progressive Movements:</strong> Women have historically played prominent roles in various progressive movements, including those advocating for social justice, labor rights, and economic equality. Figures like Angela Davis, who is both a feminist and a Marxist, have become symbols of the intersection between gender and leftist ideology. Today, many women are at the forefront of movements that promote economic redistribution, racial justice, and environmental sustainability—ideas that align with Marxist and Communist principles.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Influence:</strong> In academia, women scholars have contributed significantly to the development of Marxist and leftist theory. Feminist-Marxist thinkers often analyze the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy, arguing that economic systems exploit both class and gender. This intellectual framework has influenced progressive activism and has helped integrate gender issues into broader Marxist critiques of capitalism.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility in Activism:</strong> Progressive women are often highly visible in grassroots activism. Movements such as Black Lives Matter (co-founded by women) and various feminist organizations have adopted rhetoric that critiques capitalism, imperialism, and systemic inequality—core concerns of Marxist and Communist thought. Although these movements are not exclusively Marxist, they incorporate elements of Marxist theory in their critiques of the current socio-economic system.</p>
<p><strong>Media Portrayal:</strong> The media often highlights the involvement of progressive women in left-leaning activism, which can create a perception of female dominance in these movements. Women are frequently showcased as leaders and spokespersons in social justice movements, which may contribute to the notion that progressive women are driving the Marxist and Communist agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Intersectionality:</strong> Many progressive women advocate for intersectional approaches that combine gender, race, and class analysis. This approach often aligns with Marxist perspectives on class struggle, leading to a fusion of feminist and Marxist ideas. In this context, women in progressive circles may emphasize the need for systemic change, including critiques of capitalism, which aligns with Marxist and Communist ideologies.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Presence:</strong> Progressive women, particularly younger activists, are often influential on social media platforms. These platforms amplify voices advocating for radical change and may give the impression that women are leading the charge for Marxist or Communist ideals.</p>
<p><strong>BACK TO SATURDAY’S WARROOM:</strong></p>
<p>In his defense, White clarified that his comments were directed <strong>not</strong> at women in general but at those who, in his view, are vocal proponents of ideologies that threaten the American system, such as Marxism and Communism.</p>
<p>White began the segment by expressing his gratitude for the support he has received from his followers, particularly those in Minnesota who helped him secure a victory in the United States primary election. He acknowledged the importance of grassroots efforts and credited Steve Bannon and the War Room team for their unwavering support. “Victory begins victory,” he said, emphasizing that his recent success was a collective effort, driven by the commitment of his supporters.</p>
<p>White’s remarks reflect a broader concern among some conservatives that radical leftist ideologies are gaining traction in the United States, particularly among certain activist groups. He argued that these ideologies are harmful to the country and pose a direct threat to the rights and freedoms of American citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We have to get past all of the petty distractions and focus on the reality of what’s happening in our country,” White said. “This isn’t about men versus women; it’s about preserving the American system against those who want to tear it down,” White told the WarRoom audience.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>White also attacked the Republican establishment, criticizing it for being out of touch with the needs and concerns of working-class Americans. He pointed to the demographic shifts in places like Minnesota, where the traditional Republican base is increasingly being replaced by a diverse coalition of disillusioned voters.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“When you see black Americans, Hispanic working-class Americans, and MAGA patriots crying out for change, you can’t ignore that,” White said. He argued that the Republican Party needs to realign itself with these voters and move away from the “neoconservative, lukewarm” politics that have dominated the party for years.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>White’s rhetoric is a reflection of his populist stance, which prioritizes the interests of ordinary Americans over those of the political elite. He urged his supporters to stay focused on the issues that matter most, such as election integrity and the fight against globalist agendas.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Our only answer is to lean into the truth, embrace it, and be willing to take the consequences,” White declared. He warned that if the American people do not rally against these forces, the country could be lost to the very ideologies he fears.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As White concluded his remarks for the opening segment, he talked about the moment’s urgency, describing it as a pivotal time in American history.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We have 80 days until November, and we need to make some hard decisions about our direction,” he said. He called on his supporters to remain vigilant and to continue fighting for the principles they believe in, even in the face of criticism and opposition.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, Royce White’s comments served as both a defense of his controversial statements and a rallying cry for his supporters. His unapologetic stance on issues like Marxism, Communism, and the future of the Republican Party highlights the deep ideological divide in American politics today.</p>
<p>As White emerges as a champion of populist ideals, his words resonate with those who feel left behind by the political establishment and are searching for a new direction for the country.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about me,” White said. “It’s about the ideas that will save America.”</p>
