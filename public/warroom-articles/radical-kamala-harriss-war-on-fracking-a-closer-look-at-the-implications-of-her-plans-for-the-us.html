<div>
<p>In a Wednesday WarRoom discussion with Dave Brat, energy expert Dave Walsh critically analyzed Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris’s energy policies, mainly focusing on her stance on fracking and the broader implications for the American public.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Kamala has been out in the past aggressively with a full ban recommendation on fracking of oil and gas across the country, a full ban on offshore drilling of any kind. She’s pushing environmental justice and government-capped utility costs, which California has already experimented with. If a full ban on fracking is implemented, we could face massive price increases in energy costs. Natural gas is essential for providing the industrial and technological capacity we’re discussing,” Walsh told Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>FACT CHECK: TRUE</p>
<p>As the conversation unfolded, Walsh outlined the potential consequences of these progressive policies, drawing attention to how they might impact energy costs, economic stability, and the nation’s energy independence.</p>
<p>Walsh highlighted the significant role of fracking in the U.S. energy landscape, noting that approximately 70% of the country’s natural gas comes from this method. Natural gas, in turn, accounts for about 42% of the electricity generated in the United States. This electricity is crucial for various sectors, including industrial server centers, data centers, and AI systems that require consistent and reliable energy sources.</p>
<p>Walsh pointed out, “If a full ban on fracking is implemented, we could face massive price increases in energy costs. Natural gas is essential for providing the industrial and technological capacity we’re discussing.”</p>
<p>Harris, who has been tapped at the Democrat Presidential candidate as Democrat Joe Biden dropped out earlier in the week, has always been vocal about her support for environmental justice initiatives, which include a complete ban on fracking and offshore drilling.</p>
<p>Walsh reminded the WarRoom audience that Harris also advocates for government-capped utility costs, as experimented with in California. Walsh criticized these policies, arguing that they could lead to inefficient energy use and obscure the true cost of electricity.</p>
<p>Walsh explained, “California’s approach, where 42% of electricity costs are allocated back to taxpayers through taxes rather than usage rates, is appalling for efficiency. It hides the real cost of electricity, promoting inefficiency.” He added that the current administration has already seen a 31% increase in electricity costs nationwide, attributing this to the shift from traditional energy sources to renewable ones like solar and wind, which he argues are less reliable.</p>
<p>The conversation further explores the economic implications of Harris’s policies. The U.S. is a significant exporter of energy-related products, including natural gas and oil, vital for maintaining a balanced trade deficit. Walsh highlighted that four of the top five exported commodities are energy-related, emphasizing their importance to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>“Our top exports include natural gas, oil, chemicals derived from gasoline, and plastics. These are crucial for stabilizing the currency and managing the trade deficit with countries like China,” Walsh noted. A full ban on fracking, as proposed by Harris, could disrupt this balance, affecting not only domestic energy supplies but also international trade relations.</p>
<p>Walsh urged policymakers and the public to consider the long-term implications of Harris’s energy policies when voting in November. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach, such as President Trump’s,  that ensures energy independence, economic stability, and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Walsh told Brat, “We must continue to support domestic energy production to maintain a strong economy and prevent trade imbalances. Energy policy should focus on leveraging our natural resources while also investing in sustainable practices.”</p>
