<p>The brother of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is a former Legislative Correspondent for Democratic Congressman Sean Casten, who serves on the House Financial Services Committee and its subcommittees involved in “investor protection” and “consumer protection.”</p>
<p>Rep. Casten also participated in a congressional hearing featuring Sam Bankman-Fried, though he failed to ask the CEO of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange platform any questions.</p>
<p>The unearthed affiliation between the brother of the former FTX CEO and Rep. Casten follows Bankman-Fried donating nearly $40 million to Democrats during the 2022 midterm election cycle.</p>
<p>Congressional records <a href="https://www.legistorm.com/search/search.html?textsearch=gabe+bankman-fried">reveal</a> that Gabe Bankman-Fried worked in Rep. Casten’s office for a period of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-bankman-fried-39ba35159/">two</a> years from January 2019 to February 2021. His LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-bankman-fried-39ba35159/">confirms</a> this employment.</p>
<p>Rep. Casten is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and <a href="https://casten.house.gov/about/committees-and-caucuses">serves</a> on the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets, the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions, and the Taskforce on Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The Illinois Congressman’s role gives him considerable influence over the House’s approach to cryptocurrency and fintech regulation, with many speculating that the lax regulations for the industry <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-12/white-house-monitoring-ftx-collapse-calls-for-crypto-regulation">contributed</a> to the fall of FTX.</p>
<p>Rep. Casten participated in a December 8th, 2021 hearing featuring House Financial Services Committee members and Crypto CEOS, among which Sam Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/hfsc-crypto-ceos-hearing/">included</a>.</p>
<p>“Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) said asked if stablecoins can be designed to insulate the contamination of that system such that if someone is buying something that looks like a dollar, they are not actually being tracked by adversaries. Allaire said the benefit of this technology is the greater transparency,” explained a summary of the hearing.</p>
<p>“Casten asked Allaire if he supports the PWG's report recommendations. Allaire said he supports it but not uniformly because there are a number of challenges with the report â€" such as what form of federal charter ought to be in place around a large scale stablecoin. Allaire argued it should not necessarily be what the PWG report suggested,” it <a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/hfsc-crypto-ceos-hearing/">continued</a>.</p>
