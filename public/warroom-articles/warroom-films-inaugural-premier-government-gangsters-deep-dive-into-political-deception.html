<p>Dan Fleuette, co-producer of the film “Government Gangsters,” spoke with WarRoom last week ahead of the film’s premiere at the RNC. This documentary, based on the book by former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Kash Patel, emerges as a potent exposé on the corruption within the political system. Fleuette passionately discussed the creation and significance of this latest WarRoom Films production.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The film was dedicated to federal inmate #05635-509, Stephen K. Bannon, Political prisoner FCI, Danbury Federal Correctional Institution. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This rapid production pace was crucial. Bannon, who acted as co-producer with Fleuette, faced a looming prison sentence for defying a congressional subpoena,a move seen by many to silence Bannon before the November election. Bannon’s commitment to the project, working on it up until his surrender to Danbury Federal Prison, elevates the film’s importance and urgency.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This film is not just a documentary; it’s a revelation that will forever alter your perception of government,” Bannon emphasized in a <a href="https://warroom.org/steve-bannons-government-gangsters-premiere-see-it-live-at-the-rnc-preorder-now-exposing-deep-state-corruption/">press statement</a> about the film before the start of his incarcaration. “May we never need another film like this again.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>“First of all, I’m really happy to be here with you on this side of the camera for the first time,” Fleuette began, reflecting on his extensive collaboration with Bannon over the past two decades. “We’ve done dozens of documentaries together, and Steve sends me probably five projects a day. One day, he sent me ‘Government Gangsters,’ and I thought it was a perfect film to do.”</p>
<p>Drawing parallels with their previous work, such as “Clinton Cash,” Fleuette highlighted the film’s evolution in tone and scope. “Clinton Cash was primarily about using power and influence to fund the Clintons and their foundations. This took on a darker, more sinister tone, exploring how government gangsters in the deep state operate to try to take down a then-candidate and sitting president, and even up to today.”</p>
<p>The film meticulously unpacks the intricate machinations of these so-called government gangsters. “We do a deep dive on a very complicated subject, looking at the players involved in these nefarious actions and exposing them all,” Fleuette explained. The goal was to present a complex narrative in an accessible and compelling manner. “It really will blow your head up. It’s one of our best pieces, and we’re really proud of it.”</p>
<p>Fleuette’s recounting of the timeline reveals the urgency and dedication behind the film’s production: “Like usual, it was like drinking through a fire hose. We started in May, and it took about two and a half months. But we’re built for speed. We know how to operate as a streamlined, small crew that’s worked together for a long time.”</p>
<p>Fleuette invited the RNC attendees to view the premiere at the Miller High Life Theater. The film is also available for purchase on the War Room’s website. “I think the audience will really like it, particularly if they enjoyed ‘Clinton Cash’ and any of the other films we’ve done. It’s an amazing project.”</p>
<p>“Government Gangsters,” based on the best-selling book by former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Kash Patel, exposes the depths of deceit and manipulation employed by corrupt bureaucrats and government oligarchs. It reveals their efforts to undermine President Trump and his supporters, offering a stark portrayal of political betrayal.</p>
<p>As the film premiered amidst political tension, “Government Gangsters” promises to be a powerful narrative, capturing the essence of a tumultuous political landscape and the relentless quest for truth and justice.</p>
