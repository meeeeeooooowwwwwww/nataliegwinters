<p>Milwaukee, WI—In the vibrant atmosphere of the RNC Convention in Milwaukee, Congressman Burgess Owens stood against the bustling Fiserv Arena, reflecting with Real America’s Voice correspondent Ben Bergquam about the significance of the Republican event and the state of America under President Trump’s leadership.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This week is not just a convention; it’s a celebration of America’s resilience,” Owens, a former Democrat, remarked. “We’re here to highlight President Trump’s courage, boldness, and his unwavering love for our country.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For Owens and many attendees, the RNC Convention represents a pivotal moment in American politics, where supporters of the America First agenda gather to reaffirm their commitment to principles of freedom, patriotism, and prosperity. “We’ve grown tired of division and negativity,” Owens emphasized. “It’s time to move forward with optimism and unity under America First principles.”</p>
<p>When asked about the role of the media and its impact on public discourse, Owens didn’t mince words. “The American people are tired of being misled. We’re holding everyone accountable, and that includes the media. It’s time for honesty and integrity in reporting,” he asserted, echoing sentiments widely shared among convention attendees.</p>
<p>NOT ALWAYS A REPUBLICAN- MAGA FOREVER NOW</p>
<p>Owens, now a prominent Republican figure and nominee for Utah’s 4th Congressional District, underwent a political evolution shaped by his experiences in football and business. Reflecting on his journey, Owens recalled, “I’ve always been a conservative, and that’s what I realized.” He acknowledged voting Democrat initially due to familial influences but shifted as he embraced conservative values.</p>
<p>Owens, a former NFL player, transitioned to the GOP later in life, influenced by witnessing Ronald Reagan’s presidency and a desire to build his business. His political career now includes a bid to unseat incumbent Democrat Ben McAdams, reflecting a competitive race emblematic of national political dynamics.</p>
<p>Speaking on his party allegiance, Owens highlighted Republican principles of freedom and personal responsibility. “More and more Black Americans [are] leaving the Democrat plantation,” Owens noted, attributing this shift partly to President Trump’s policies benefiting minority communities.</p>
<p>Embracing Trump’s endorsement, Owens emphasized the president’s effectiveness and unapologetic style, stating, “I support any president who will fight for the American way.”</p>
<p>Owens’s campaign focuses on traditional values and contrasts with what he views as the leftward shift of Democratic leadership. He criticizes opponents for policies he deems detrimental to American ideals, advocating a return to core principles of governance and societal unity.</p>
<p>From his upbringing in the South to his NFL career and entrepreneurial setbacks, Owens’s journey underscores his commitment to conservative ideals and a vision for a revitalized America. As he prepares for the general election, Owens remains steadfast in his belief that his platform resonates with voters across party lines who prioritize faith, family, and country.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to future elections and policy initiatives, Owens expressed confidence in the country’s direction to Bergquam. “We’re poised to win back the House and the Senate. With President Trump’s leadership, we can implement policies that make a real difference in people’s lives,” he remarked, underlining the importance of translating rhetoric into tangible action.</p>
<p>Regarding shifts in public opinion, particularly in minority communities, Owens noted a growing alignment with conservative principles of freedom and opportunity. “Communities across America, including black and Hispanic communities, are increasingly resonating with our message,” he observed. “They want to see policies that empower individuals and foster economic growth.”</p>
<p>Throughout the interview with Bergquam, Owens emphasized the need for unity and solidarity among Americans of all backgrounds. “We’re heading towards a resurgence of American values and unity,” he said with conviction. “It’s a remarkable time for our party and our nation.”</p>
<p>As the RNC Convention unfolds, Owens’s words about the America First agenda will reach millions of American viewers. The event serves not only as a platform for political discourse for the left that the media loves to cover,  but also as a call to action for the Populist-Nationalist movement of American values.</p>
<p>Owens’s presence at the RNC Convention shows a commitment to positive change and a vision for a united America. His message of optimism, accountability, and renewal resonates deeply with supporters and underscores the stakes of the upcoming elections and the future direction of the country.</p>
