<p>WarRoom Correspondent Jayne Zirkle discusses President Trump’s press conference at Mar-a-Lago where he addressed the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments in the Colorado ballot disqualification case where bogus lawfare tactics are being used to claim he is disqualified for insurrection under the 14th Amendment despite never being charged or convicted of insurrection. Zirkle shares that President Trump addressed these claims head on explaining his remarks on January 6th, "<span>I said ‘peacefully and patriotically.’ The speech was called peacefully and patriotically. It’s peacefully and patriotically,” concluded Trump. President Trump also stated that if there was any insurrection it was caused by Nancy Pelosi stating, </span><span>“I think it was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi. This was an insurrection, if it was an insurrection, which, there were no guns, there were no anything, except for the fact that they shot Ashli Babbitt. Somebody from, at least four, shot Ashli Babbitt. So unnecessary, so sad, so horrible. But there were no guns. There were no anything,”</span></p>
<p>Zirkle gives her assessment that the past 72 hours have been filled with major success for President Trump between soaring poll numbers heading into Super Tuesday, Joe Biden being declared mentally unfit, and take always from oral arguments at the Supreme Court pointing favorably in President Trump’s direction to stay on the ballot.</p>
