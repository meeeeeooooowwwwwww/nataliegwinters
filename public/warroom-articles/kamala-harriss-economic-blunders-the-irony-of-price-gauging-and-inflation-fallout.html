<p>In a scathing critique on Monday’s WarRoom,  host Peter Navarro took aim at Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris’s economic policies, highlighting her missteps in a biting analysis that exposes the irony and foolishness of her actions. As the 2024 presidential election looms, Navarro didn’t hold back in pointing out how Harris’s policy decisions, particularly her approach to inflation and price controls, have exacerbated the very problems she now seeks to solve.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“You broke it, you bought it,” Navarro declared, using the famous adage to encapsulate Harris’s predicament. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As the second-in-command and potential presidential candidate, Harris finds herself in a position where she must now fix the economic issues she helped create. According to Navarro, her record is marred by mistakes that could haunt her campaign, starting with her mishandling of inflation.</p>
<p>Navarro began by lampooning Harris’s recent speech in which she repeatedly mentioned her commitment to passing a federal ban on “price gauging,” a term she confusingly used instead of “price gouging.” "Even if you don’t have a PhD in economics,” Navarro quipped, "it’s hilarious… I mean, what the hell does ‘price gauging’ even mean?” This blunder, he argued, highlighted Harris’s lack of understanding of basic economic concepts.</p>
<p>According to Navarro, Harris’s proposal for price controls is emblematic of her failure to grasp the consequences of such policies. "Price controls don’t work,” he stated bluntly. "In Kamala’s supermarket of the future, there just won’t be enough eggs and meat to buy.” Navarro warned that this isn’t just economic folly; it’s political suicide. He equated her strategy to a "hat trick” of errors, linking it to "first-world communism, California liberalism, and third-world Venezuelan socialism.”</p>
<p>But Navarro didn’t stop at ridiculing her economic acumen. He criticized Harris’s role in passing two major spending bills that he blames for fueling inflation: the 2021 $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and the 2022 $740 billion Inflation Reduction Act. "Whenever I say ‘Inflation Reduction Act,’ I get like this,” Navarro remarked, feigning discomfort. "It’s Orwellian to call what they did the Inflation Reduction Act when it should have been called the Inflation on Steroids Act.”</p>
<p>The irony, Navarro noted, is that Harris cast the tie-breaking votes for these bills as President of the Senate, making her directly responsible for much of the current economic woes. "As the sign in the pottery store says: you broke it, you bought it,” he reiterated.</p>
<p>Navarro’s critique also extended to Harris’s overall policy record, including her handling of the border crisis, energy issues, and crime. He dubbed her the "fracking queen of Pennsylvania” and the "defunding-the-police princess of San Francisco.” According to Navarro, Harris’s failures in these areas are equally damaging and compound her "you broke it, you bought it” problem.</p>
<p>Navarro concluded by noting the profound irony in Harris’s situation. She now faces the unenviable task of running for president while trying to convince voters that she can solve problems she helped create. "To win,” Navarro advised, "Harris must promise voters she will fix every problem that she herself has helped create.” However, with economic indicators like inflation, housing costs, and gas prices all rising under her watch, Navarro suggested that Harris’s chances of making this case convincingly are slim.</p>
<p>In a final jab, Navarro warned that Harris’s economic gaffes, particularly her "price gauging” remark, would be ripe for exploitation by her political opponents. "Donald Trump is chomping at the bit to tag her with it,” he predicted. The former president, who delivered four years of "near zero inflation, rising real wages, and stable growth,” would, in Navarro’s view, relish the opportunity to contrast his record with Harris’s economic missteps.</p>
