<h4>Stop ‘Wokeism’ with Faith</h4>
<p>Despite 80% of Americans identifying as Christians, a shocking disconnect exists between faith and civic engagement, as evidenced by alarming trends in voter turnout and moral beliefs. David Barton and Bill Federer appeared on the WarRoom on Thursday to urge church leaders and congregants to rise against the tide of secularism and reclaim the nation through informed voting and active participation in societal issues.</p>
<h4>A Disturbing Disconnect Between Faith and Action</h4>
<p>In a recent panel discussion, David Barton, Bill Federer, and Dave Brat confronted the stark reality facing American Christians today. Barton highlighted a significant paradox: "You have 80% of the United States identifying as Christians, and yet we have a woke weaponized $7 trillion budget and a border invasion. The nation is under attack.” This alarming situation begs the question: why are Christians not translating their faith into action?</p>
<p>Barton pointed to the troubling trends revealed in two national polls, which indicated a steep decline in the voting engagement of professing Christians. Historically, this demographic has been one of the most reliable voting blocs, with 99% turnout in 2016. Yet, the current projected turnout for active church-going Christians sits at a staggering 41% who are not planning to vote in the upcoming elections. "That’s only 59% that will vote, and this is a constituency where Trump held a much higher number in previous elections,” Barton noted, expressing his concern over this disengagement.</p>
<h4>The Crisis of Moral Clarity</h4>
<p>The panelists also discussed the alarming shift in the moral landscape among church-going Christians. Barton revealed, "56% of church-going Christians say there are no absolute rights and wrongs. No moral truths.” This shift raises critical questions about the foundational beliefs that underpin Christianity. Incredibly, 42% of these Christians support abortion under all circumstances, and 30% favor socialism over capitalism—positions that starkly contrast with traditional Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>"It’s a very disturbing picture,” Barton stated, emphasizing the need for a revival of moral clarity among believers. This crisis of values can no longer be ignored, especially when many Christians are basing their voting decisions on factors that have little to do with their faith.</p>
<h4>The Role of Pastors in Mobilization</h4>
<p>One significant aspect of this discussion was the call to action directed at pastors and church leaders. Both Barton and Federer emphasized the vital role that church leaders must play in encouraging their congregations to engage in the political process. "19% of these folks say they’re more likely to vote if they hear something from the pulpit,” said Barton. "If pastors would talk about these issues and encourage their congregations to vote, we could see a dramatic increase in voter turnout.”</p>
<p>However, the statistics are sobering; only 2.8% of pastors address the pressing societal issues currently affecting the nation from the pulpit. This silence contributes to a culture of apathy and disengagement among Christians, allowing moral decay to flourish unchecked.</p>
<h4>Accountability to God</h4>
<p>The conversation took a poignant turn as Barton reminded listeners of their accountability to God. "Someday, you will stand before Him and be asked, ‘What did you do with the country I gave you?’” he warned. "Saying ‘I didn’t like any of the candidates’ is not going to be a good answer.” This powerful reminder serves as a rallying cry for Christians to take their civic responsibilities seriously and act in alignment with their beliefs.</p>
<h4>A Call for Awakening</h4>
<p>As the discussion concluded, it was evident that the stakes have never been higher for American Christians. The combined effects of political apathy and moral confusion present a formidable challenge to the future of the nation. Yet, as Barton and Federer emphasized, there is still hope. "If we give them the right call, we can get a response,” Barton asserted, encouraging believers to step forward and reclaim their voice in the public square.</p>
<p>In a time when faith and action seem worlds apart, the clarion call is clear: Christians must awaken from their slumber, engage in the political process, and re-establish the moral foundations upon which this nation was built. The future of America may very well depend on it.</p>
