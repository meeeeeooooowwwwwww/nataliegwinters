<p>In a recent WarRoom discussion between Press Secretary for President Donald J. Trump,  Karoline Leavitt, and Steve Bannon, Bannon expressed intense disapproval towards CNN and demanded an apology from the network for what he described as disrespectful treatment of Leavitt during her Monday morning appearance on behalf of Trump, ahead of a historic debate on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bannon underscored Leavitt’s significant role in the Trump campaign, highlighting her position as the National Press Secretary and her extensive experience in politics and media in his demand for respect from the news agency.</p>
<p>On the WarRoom, Leavitt recounted her experience on CNN to Bannon, where she was abruptly cut off while discussing debate moderator Jake Tapper’s previous statements about Trump.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> "The fact that they cut off my microphone simply for repeating words that Jake Tapper himself has said lies about President Trump… It was honestly shocking, what occurred this morning.” Leavitt emphasized, reminding the WarRoom that Tapper and Dana Bash have a history of making biased statements against Trump, which she believes compromises the fairness of the upcoming debate moderated by them.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bannon amplified Leavitt’s sentiment by repeatedly demanding an apology from CNN, specifically from Kasie Hunt, who was moderating the segment during which Leavitt was cut off.</p>
<p>Watch that exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NEW: CNN host Kasie Hunt has a meltdown before kicking Trump 2024 National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt off her show for pointing out Jake Tapper’s bias.</p>
<p>Kasie Hunt? More like Karen Hunt.</p>
<p>Leavitt: "It takes someone five minutes to Google Jake Tapper, Donald Trump to see… <a href="https://t.co/gb2aK8MfKd">pic.twitter.com/gb2aK8MfKd</a></p>
<p>— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) <a href="https://twitter.com/CollinRugg/status/1805221124470648988?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon argued, "They have never in the history of television ever, ever taken a national press secretary and treated her with such lack of respect. Casey Hunt owes you an apology. CNN owes you an apology today.” He insisted that without such an apology, Trump should cancel his participation in the debate.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Leavitt shared additional grievances against Tapper, citing his involvement in perpetuating the "Russia hoax” and the "Charlottesville lie,” as well as his repeated comparisons of Trump to Hitler. She argued that CNN’s actions were a clear demonstration of their bias and unwillingness to present a balanced view: "They try to pretend like they are this unbiased news network but it just simply is not the case.”</p>
<p>Bannon and Leavitt both underscored the notion that CNN operates with a profound bias against Trump and his supporters. Bannon stated, "The organizing principle of CNN is a hatred of Donald Trump in the MAGA movement to the core of their being.” He criticized CNN for failing to engage in an honest discussion, instead opting to cut off Leavitt when she presented uncomfortable facts about their moderators.</p>
<p>Throughout the discussion, Bannon insisted on the need for accountability and transparency from CNN, stressing the importance of fairness in media coverage. He argued that the network’s behavior disrespected Leavitt and signaled a broader issue of media bias against Trump and his campaign. He concluded by emphasizing the gravity of the situation: "This thing is totally rigged. They must apologize to the Trump campaign.”</p>
<p>Overall, the conversation highlighted Bannon and Leavitt’s belief that CNN’s handling of the situation was emblematic of a larger problem of media bias and unfair treatment of Trump and his campaign, advocating for a firm response to ensure fair treatment in future interactions.</p>
