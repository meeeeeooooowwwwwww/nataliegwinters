<p>Brandon Gill joins Steve Bannon’s WarRoom to react to his sweeping victory in the Texas Republican congressional primary for the 26th district. Gill, who received an endorsement from President Trump, outperformed his opponents securing over 58% of the vote. He credits his success to support from the grassroots movement and his alignment with President Trump who he identifies as the leader of the Republican Party. Gill shares disappointment with anti-Trump factions within the Republican movement and stresses his representation of the people. "The grassroots are going to push President Trump across the finish line in November,” Gill tells Steve Bannon. Gill now faces the general election up against Democrat opponent Ernest Lineberger III.</p>
