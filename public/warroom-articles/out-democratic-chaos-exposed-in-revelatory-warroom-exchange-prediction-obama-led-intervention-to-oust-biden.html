<p>In a spirited Friday exchange, Congressmen Andy Biggs of Arizona and Matt Gaetz delved into the current state of American politics on Bannon’s WarRoom. They focused mainly on the contentious atmosphere surrounding Democratic President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party and their plans to dominate 2024. The conversation highlighted significant concerns about national security, election integrity, federal spending, and the looming political climate.</p>
<p>Gaetz remarked on the looming influence of former President Barack Obama in the Biden administration, predicting an imminent intervention to persuade Biden to step down from running for President, even at this late hour in the campaign.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gaetz stated, “I think that meeting is coming where they sit Joe Biden down, and they get Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice, Obama, and they sit down Jill and Hunter and Joe, and they say it’s time for your next patriotic act. You’ve got to step aside so that we can all endorse Kamala Harris.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Biggs supported this notion, suggesting that the Biden family’s decision about Joe running would be driven by </span><span>personal interests rather than patriotism or concern for the nation.</span></p>
<p>“It’s going to be about business. It’s going to be about money. It’s going to be about evading accountability for what has happened to our country, and that ultimately, that’s the glide path,” Biggs concluded, exposing the intricate power dynamics and motivations within the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The conversation took a critical turn towards the Democratic Party, with Gaetz predicting an imminent intervention from key Democratic figures to persuade Biden to step aside for Kamala Harris. “I think that meeting is coming,” Gaetz speculated. He noted growing dissent among Democrats, with several senators and House members calling for Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 ticket.</p>
<p>Biggs shared an anecdote about a conversation just Thursday night. with Democrat Congressman Greg Stanton, who had publicly asked Biden to step down. “It’s actually receiving critical mass,” Biggs said, highlighting the widespread discontent within the Democratic ranks. The humor among Democrats, such as jokes about Biden talking to lampposts, underscores a deeper sense of despair and recognition of Biden’s incapability to lead.</p>
<p>Both Biggs and Gaetz expressed skepticism about Kamala Harris’s ability to succeed Biden. “Kamala Harris is not liked by Democrats in Congress,” Biggs stated. He argued that her unpopularity and lack of trust among Democrats would hinder her effectiveness as a leader, especially in battleground states like Arizona. “They know what’s going on with the Border,” Biggs added, criticizing Harris’s handling of the border crisis as the so-called borders.</p>
<p>Gaetz humorously suggested that Biden’s appointment of Harris might have been the first sign of his mental incompetence. “Anyone that would put Kamala Harris in charge of anything is obviously failed their mental competence test,” Gaetz quipped, highlighting the administration’s perceived failures in addressing key issues like the economy and border security.</p>
<p>Biggs emphasized tying immigration control and election integrity measures to funding legislation. “President Trump’s right on the money,” Biggs asserted. The only way you will move this forward is to tie it to funding. That’s the only thing they respond to.” This approach ensures states enforce measures that prevent illegal voting and maintain accurate voter rolls.</p>
<p>The discussion between Biggs and Gaetz painted a grim picture of the current political landscape for Democrats and Republicans over funding issues, with internal strife and dissatisfaction plaguing both parties.</p>
<p>Their call for fiscal responsibility and election integrity measures underscores the challenges ahead as the 2024 election approaches. As Biggs aptly put it, “This is about the money, the power, the pardons,” emphasizing the high stakes in the ongoing political battles.</p>
