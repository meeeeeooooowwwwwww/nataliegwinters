<p>In an electrifying start to the BIG3 basketball season, the league garnered over 3 million views within the first five hours of its live broadcast on 𝕏 (formerly Twitter), with expectations of reaching over 5 million by Sunday morning. The BIG3, a premier professional 3-on-3 basketball league, has quickly captivated fans with its unique format and exciting play. One of the standout moments came from Power team member Royce White, a frequent guest of the WarRoom, who has become a pivotal figure both on and off the court.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the full Saturday game:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>BIG3 Week 2 – Tampa, 2024. <a href="https://t.co/qPvmsuq9eS">https://t.co/qPvmsuq9eS</a></p>
<p>— BIG3 (@thebig3) <a href="https://twitter.com/thebig3/status/1804590808148160862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tired of the NBA’s Woke Agenda:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“BIG3 is where FIREBALL3 superstars play. The premier global league features many of the greatest, most popular and skilled professional athletes of all time.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Royce White Shines in Power’s Victory</strong></p>
<p>According to<a href="https://big3.com/teams/power/"> his team bio</a>, White, the MNGOP-endorsed candidate for US Senate ’24 in Minnesota, is a native of Minneapolis, MN, standing at 6’8″. White has a history of making significant impacts wherever he plays. The first overall pick in the 2019 BIG3 draft, White returned to Power as a co-captain for the 2023 season. Known for his hustle and passing ability, White has been instrumental in pushing Power back into title contention under the guidance of Coach Nancy “Lady Magic” Lieberman.</p>
<p>Big 3 announcers reported that Coach Lieberman, who led Power to a championship in 2018 and was named BIG3 Coach of the Year, has a deep understanding of what it takes to succeed in this league. Lieberman emphasized the importance of White’s role in the team, saying, “Royce is a team-first player whose hustle and passing ability consistently impact the game. His presence on the court is crucial for our success.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Power secured a thrilling 51-47 victory. White’s performance was a highlight, particularly in the first quarter, where his aggressive play and sharp passing set the tone for the game. Despite facing a tough defense, White managed to draw fouls, create scoring opportunities, and provide a strong presence in the paint.</p>

<p><strong>White’s Advocacy and Impact Beyond Basketball- 5 Million Views and Still Going</strong></p>
<p>White’s influence extends beyond the basketball court. He is a frequent guest on the WarRoom and has been vocal about various social and political issues. Notably, at Saturday’s game, White was seen with “Free Steve Bannon” marked on his head, continuing his trend of using the court as a platform for his rebellious to the corporate media and NBA messaging.</p>

<p><strong>The BIG3’s Growing Popularity</strong></p>
<p>The BIG3’s format, which features a mix of veteran talent and dynamic newcomers, has struck a chord with basketball fans. As Tom Wick noted on 𝕏, “I find this game so much more relatable than modern NBA games. @icecube got so much right with this league.”</p>
<p>Founder Ice Cube emphasized the league’s mission to Fox News in 2023, to engage with communities nationwide: “We’re going to be all over the country this summer, hopefully making cities a little better than we found them when we leave. That’s our plan. I think it should be everybody’s plan. Everybody’s got to look in the mirror and say, ‘What can I do to make things better?’ That’s the only way it’s going to change.</p>

The actor/rapper/entrepreneur is the founder of Big3, the 3-on-3 basketball league that’s on the rise and opens its season this weekend in Oakland. He tucks into the changes and Big3 is experiencing — and the influence it’s having on some NBA rule changes. This includes talk on the league’s growth — it’s sold its first franchise for a $10 million fee and is expanding. Ice Cube also talks about his role as the president of Raider Nation, actors and rappers with game (Kevin Hart?) and the best sports venue he’s performed in.</p>
