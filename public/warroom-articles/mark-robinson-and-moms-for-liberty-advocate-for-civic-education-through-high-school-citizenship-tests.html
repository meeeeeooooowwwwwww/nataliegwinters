<div>
<p>Republican Lt. Governor Mark Robinson, a former activist from Greensboro, North Carolina, and current Republican candidate for Governor of North Carolina, recently addressed Moms for Liberty North Carolina chapters at the General Assembly in Raleigh on the capital city’s grassy lawn.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I am as proud of you for standing strong for your children as I am of my own Mom,” Robinson told the group, adding,” My mom is the greatest leader I have ever known. She could have chosen to life a life on Welfare to raise us, instead she chose to be a custodian and to teach us that we will get what we work hard for. That is what you all are doing here now.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At the informal meeting, local media, state lawmakers, and activists gathered to discuss what they wanted from the state government. It was a testament to local grassroots activism, a cornerstone of American-style democracy.</p>
<p>Everyone in the group led by example, partaking in the American civics process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In his public remarks at the Moms for Liberty event, Robinson emphasized the crucial role of mothers in education and credited his mother with instilling values that still guide his public service. He received a warm reception from attendees, underscoring his popularity among grassroots activists and his ability to connect with diverse audiences.</p>

<p>Robinson passionately talked about the discrepancies in responses to various issues in North Carolina, criticizing the lack of action against incidents of antisemitism while condemning the labeling of concerned parents as domestic terrorists for advocating against inappropriate school curricula. He asserted that the school system did not own children. He emphasized that certain topics have no place in education, advocating for a focus on fundamental subjects like reading, writing, civics, and mathematics.</p>
<p>He expressed pride in parents’ efforts to advocate for their children’s rights, emphasizing that their actions contribute to preserving a brighter future for the state and nation.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Robinson’s transition from activism to public office has been marked by a willingness to balance personal convictions with public policy demands. He spoke to the WarRoom about the challenges of tempering personal opinions while shaping legislation that benefits the broader community, a task he believes he has learned to navigate successfully.</p>
<p>Overall, Robinson’s journey exemplifies the pathway from grassroots activism to gubernatorial candidacy, demonstrating how individuals can leverage community engagement to shape public policy and effect meaningful change within their communities.</p>
<p>His candidacy represents a significant milestone in North Carolina’s political history. He promises a campaign focused on conservative principles and responsive governance.</p>
<p>The same can be said for Moms like Julie Page, who never considered that she should be learning how to shape bills for legislation as part of her description as a Mom.  But there she was in her third year of activism, now a legislative spokeswoman for the state, organizing rallies and breakfasts for state lawmakers.</p>
<p>Moms for Liberty, the largest and most prominent parental rights group in North Carolina, advocates for significant educational reform across the United States, including requiring high school students to pass a U.S. Citizenship test to graduate.</p>
<p>This proposal, initially introduced in North Carolina and potentially spreading to other states, aims to strengthen civic education and ensure students have a foundational understanding of American history and governance. According to<a href="https://portal.momsforliberty.org/chapters/wake-county-nc/"> Becky Lew-Hobbs, president of the Wake County chapter of Moms for Liberty</a> and one of the earliest advocates for the requirement, the proposed test would closely resemble the U.S. Naturalization test in its format and content.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, during Moms for Liberty’s legislative day in North Carolina, numerous members of the General Assembly engaged with the group to discuss their proposals for school reform, including a state requirement for graduating seniors and a citizenship test requirement. The legislators and activists explored avenues for advancing their broader legislative agenda with a breakfast meeting and later with a public rally.</p>
<p>Republican State Rep.<a href="https://johntorbett.com/"> John Torbert</a> of Stanley Co. told WarRoom that he supports the Moms for Liberty agenda, including the citizen test. He says, “School kids don’t know as much about the founding of our country as they do about who the Kardashians are dating.” He suggests that if such a civics requirement did make it into a bill, it would likely fall under a “social studies” requirement.</p>
<p>Republican State Rep. <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/779">David Willis</a> of Union Co. told WarRoom that he had attended the legislative breakfast with the Moms and supported their stand for their children.</p>
<p>Republican candidate for Lt. Governor <a href="https://www.halweathermanfornc.com/">Hal Weatherman</a>, was also in attendance at the Capitol rally to support the moms and told WarRoom that he has <a href="https://portal.momsforliberty.org/pledge/">signed the pledge</a> to support the group as a candidate.</p>

<p></p>
<p>National leaders also support the initiative for a citizen test for Liberty National Co-Founder Tiffany Justice, who told media that the test was suggested out of concerns about declining literacy rates among American students and what they see as a lack of civic engagement.</p>
<p>Justice contends that many high school graduates cannot read proficiently or understand fundamental civic responsibilities outlined in the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>She argues that integrating a citizenship test requirement into high school graduation criteria will equip students with essential knowledge about the nation’s history and governmental structure, fostering more informed and engaged citizens.</p>
<p>The initiative in North Carolina marks a pivotal moment as Moms for Liberty aims to influence educational policy nationally. With over 300 chapters across 48 states, the organization’s legislative push reflects a concerted effort to leverage grassroots activism.</p>
<p>This strategy includes significant financial investments in advertising and outreach efforts, particularly targeting key presidential battleground states like North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin.</p>
