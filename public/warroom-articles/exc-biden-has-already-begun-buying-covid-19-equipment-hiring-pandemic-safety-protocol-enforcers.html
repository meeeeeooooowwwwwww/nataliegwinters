<p>The federal government has started purchasing COVID-19 equipment and hiring advisors on "safety protocols” amidst speculation the Biden White House will reinstate pandemic-era lockdowns and mandates, War Room can reveal.</p>
<p>The unearthed government contracts from entities including the Department of Defense (DOD) show millions in taxpayer funds being used to purchase COVID-19 equipment such as test kits. Some of the contracts, which are traceable via the federal government’s spending <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">database</a>, are even scheduled to begin in future months such as September and October.</p>
<p>The DOD, for example, gave <a href="http://usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_W81K0223F0027_9700_W81K0421D0010_9700">Hologic</a> Sales and Service LLC a $1.5 million contract beginning on October 1st that’s set to conclude in May of 2024. The federal database reveals the funds are for "Hologic<span> covid testing services in support of the department of pathology at Madigan army medical center, Tacoma, WA 98431. (new delivery order).”</span></p>
<div>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also inked a $2 million contract with <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_36C24123N1005_3600_36C24121A0078_3600">Abbott</a> Molecular Inc. beginning on September 22nd. Set to conclude in September of 2024, the contract will provide testing services for viruses including COVID-19.</div>
<div>The VA also started a $1.3 million contract with <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_36C24123N0983_3600_36C24121A0048_3600">Biofire</a> Diagnostics LLC on August 18th for its "COVID-19 testing reagents and equipment.” The contract is slated to expire in August of next year.</div>
<div>On August 14th, the VA also began a $3.3 million contract with <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_36C10B23N00040009_3600_36C10B21D0004_3600">Oddball</a> Inc for advisory on "adequate COVID/19 safety protocols”:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>"TASK ORDER IS FOR DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE. “EO14042” MODIFICATION TO ADD FAR 52.223-99 ENSURING ADEQUATE COVID-19 SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR FEDERAL CONTRACTORS (OCT 2021) (DEVIATION).”</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p>The contract is set to expire in August of next year.</p>
<p>The unearthed contracts follow the mainstream media hyping an alleged surge in COVID-19 cases across America, which also dovetails with COVID-19 vaccine makers such as Pfizer experiencing a rapid decline in <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/covid-revenues-disappoint-pfizer-looks-prune-costs">profits</a>.</p>
