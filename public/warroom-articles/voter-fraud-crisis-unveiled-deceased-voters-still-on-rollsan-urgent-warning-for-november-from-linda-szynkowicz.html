<p>In a timely discussion with Ben Harnwell, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfaB_OFQn9w">Linda Szynkowicz</a> on Tuesday’s WarRoom, founder and CEO of the <a href="https://www.fightvoterfraud.org/about-us/">Fight Voter Fraud</a> initiative, highlighted the ongoing and alarming issues with voter rolls across the United States. Szynkowicz’s revelations paint a troubling picture of systemic weaknesses in election integrity, exposing the urgent need for reforms ahead of the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>Szynkowicz’s organization, which operates in 36 states, has been at the forefront of addressing voter roll inaccuracies. During the interview, she detailed significant findings from their research, mainly focusing on Connecticut. "In Connecticut, despite presenting evidence, we still have 524 deceased voters on the rolls from 2020,” Szynkowicz stated. She emphasized the gravity of the situation, noting that these deceased individuals remained active on voter rolls and, in some cases, even participated in elections.</p>
<p>The Fight Voter Fraud initiative’s work involves identifying and removing deceased voters and addressing instances of double registrations. Szynkowicz revealed that her team has uncovered thousands of discrepancies, including "758 deceased voters found on the rolls and 2450 double registrations.” She criticized the lack of action by state officials and election authorities, arguing that their inaction perpetuates the problem. "It is unbelievable that even after presenting proof, deceased voters are not being removed from the rolls,” she lamented.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> "If they stole the election in 2020, they will certainly try to do it again in 2024,” she warned, alluding to concerns about the potential for repeated fraud. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Her remarks reflect a deep-seated frustration with what she perceives as systemic failures in election oversight.</p>
<p>The conversation took a critical turn as Szynkowicz discussed the broader context of her efforts. She emphasized the importance of grassroots involvement, urging citizens to actively participate in ensuring voter roll accuracy. "You can check your local voter rolls and challenge any inaccuracies,” she advised. She encouraged the public to visit their website, fightvoterfraud.org, for tools and information to help address these issues locally.</p>
<p>Szynkowicz’s initiative also recently submitted evidence to the FBI regarding double voting cases in states like North Carolina, West Virginia, and Maryland. "There are hundreds of thousands of double-registered voters across the country,” she said, underscoring the scale of the problem and the need for rigorous enforcement against voter fraud.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her experience since founding the initiative in 2018, Szynkowicz noted that the situation has worsened over time. "The problem has been growing since at least 2008,” she remarked, expressing concern over the increasing prevalence of fraudulent registrations. She stressed the importance of vigilance and accountability, both from election officials and the public.</p>
<p>Szynkowicz’s conversation with Harnwell reveals a pressing need for reform in voter registration practices. Her insights into the persistence of voter roll inaccuracies and the potential for electoral fraud in 2024 are a stark reminder of the challenges facing election integrity efforts.</p>
<p>CALL TO ACTION:</p>
<p>As the fight against voter fraud continues, Szynkowicz’s call to action for increased public engagement and oversight remains critical.</p>
