<p>In a recent WarRoom conversation, Steve Bannon and Sean Spicer discussed Spicer’s new documentary, “Front Row Joe’s,” which explores the dedicated supporters of the ‘America First’ movement and President Donald J. Trump. The dialogue centers on the inspiration behind the documentary and its focus on capturing the essence of the “America First” and “MAGA” movements through the experiences of loyal Trump rally attendees.</p>
<p>In the conversation between  Spicer and Bannon, Spicer quotes one of the “Front Row Joe’s” as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“People think I’m obsessed with Donald Trump. It’s actually I’m obsessed with this country and he wants to make it better.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Spicer explains that the idea for the documentary emerged from conversations with colleagues from the 2016 Trump campaign. Spicer told Bannon that they all noticed a unique movement forming around Trump, which Bannon had likened to the Deadhead community who followed the Grateful Dead.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>In the conversation, Sean Spicer remarks on the media’s treatment of Trump supporters by saying:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The media dismisses them. They treat Trump supporters like zoo animals that deserve to be petted and looked at from a distance.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Concerned that the media and history might overlook this powerful phenomenon, Spicer documents all he can in a film. He told Bannon that he began following these loyal supporters, dubbed “Front Row Joe’s,” to understand their motivations, friendships, and personal stories- and build relationships with them.</p>
<p>The documentary looks at the lives of these supporters, who often attend numerous rallies, enduring harsh conditions to show their support for Trump. Spicer highlights a scene in Pennsylvania where supporters camped out in pouring rain for days before a rally. Spicer and Bannon portray these individuals, some of whom have attended over 80 rallies, as the movement’s backbone.</p>
<p>The Front Row Joe’s travel across the country, waving flags and showing up wherever Trump goes.</p>

<p>— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) <a href="https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/1804152105042645449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Spicer attributes Trump’s appeal to his authenticity and directness. Trump’s background as a builder and businessman allows him to connect with people on a practical level, making his promises seem genuine, Spicer said. This authenticity, Spicer argues, resonates with supporters who believe Trump is committed to making tangible changes, as evidenced by his actions in office, such as renegotiating NAFTA and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
<p>The conversation also touches on personal stories featured in the documentary, such as Rick Frazier, whose daughter died from fentanyl. Frazier views Trump’s stance on border security as vital, contrasting it with President Biden’s policies.</p>
<p>Spicer emphasizes the importance of the documentary for those who may not understand the movement or its supporters. He urges even Trump critics to watch it to gain insight into the motivations and beliefs of the “Front Row Joe’s.” Bannon agrees, suggesting that the film could help bridge the understanding gap between Trump supporters and detractors, particularly those in media and elite circles who often dismiss these supporters.</p>
<p>Both Bannon and Spicer believe that this documentary captures a critical part of American political history and sheds light on the real people behind the rallies, their dedication, and their belief in Trump’s vision for the country.</p>
