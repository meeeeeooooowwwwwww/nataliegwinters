<p>On Friday morning, Steve Bannon and US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) made a joint appearance at Real America’s Voice (RAV) studios in Florida for the WarRoom’s Friday edition, showcasing their unity to the American people during chaotic times.</p>
<p>In a defiant stance reminiscent of the Allied forces during World War II, they stood together resolutely against the US House of Representatives, which voted to uphold Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) ‘s speakership this week after Greene’s unsuccessful motion to vacate the chair- and unseat Johnson.</p>
<p>Greene and Bannon portray a unified front against what they describe as the Axis powers of the Uniparty.</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles and personal sacrifices Greene and Bannon have encountered in their efforts to challenge the speaker position on behalf of an America First agenda, their alliance remained steadfast.</p>
<p>They are offering the WarRoom audience a beacon of hope amid the chaos of a Representative Republic seemingly deaf to its people’s voices, drowned out by the noise of clandestine dealings and corrupt power moves.</p>
<p>Bannon laid out their case for resisting the status quo in DC:</p>
<p>In their passionate Friday discussion, Greene and Bannon lay bare their frustration with Johnson’s recent actions, which they see as part of a broader issue within the Republican Party. They discussed Johnson’s perceived naivete and betrayal, particularly his apparent willingness to engage with the Biden administration despite their staunch opposition to its policies. Greene underscores the mandate given by voters in 2022 to oppose Democratic initiatives, especially concerning border security and spending, yet Johnson’s actions seem to undermine this mandate, according to her.</p>
<p>The duo expresses grave concern over Johnson’s failure to effectively leverage the power of the purse, allowing Democratic priorities to prevail in recent spending bills. They condemn Johnson and the 196 Republicans who supported him repeatedly, viewing the Uni party’s actions as a betrayal of America First principles and a failure to oppose the Democratic agenda effectively.</p>
<p>They call for accountability within the party’s leadership and stress the urgency of addressing these issues, which polling shows the American people care deeply about.</p>
<p>Greene and Bannon criticize the role of media outlets like Fox News, accusing them of controlling the narrative and stifling dissent within the party. They emphasize the need for a more assertive stance against Democratic initiatives and a rejection of bipartisan approaches that they perceive as compromising Republican principles.</p>
<p>Highlighting where the uni-party goes wrong, the conversation goes on into very divisive gender issues, particularly in sports, with Greene pleading for support to defend women’s rights in athletics.</p>
<p>There is a palpable sense of urgency to address these pressing issues and hold Republican representatives accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>Bannon outright instructs his audience to call their representatives and “get in their grill.”  The WarRoom audience has a tool for outreach like that called: <a href="https://billblasterapp.org/"> Billblaster </a></p>
<p>If this were a WW2 news coverage- Bannon’s commitment to his WarRoom audience might be described thusly:</p>
<p>“In a resolute declaration to their steadfast audience, Bannon and Greene avows their unwavering commitment, echoing the stalwart resolve of sailors standing firm at their posts amidst the tumultuous theater of war. Just as soldiers on the frontlines remain steadfast in their duty, Bannon and Greene pledge to remain steadfast in his position, a beacon of unwavering dedication amidst the tempest of ideological conflict.”</p>
<p>Yet, this isn’t a mere cinematic portrayal; it is the stark reality of our times, where every political decision and action holds profound consequences in the ongoing struggle for truth and justice.</p>
