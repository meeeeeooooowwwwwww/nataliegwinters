<p>The former Digital Organizing Platforms Director for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign is now a Global Program Manager for TikTok responsible for leading the app’s efforts to censor “misinformation” and address election-related content.</p>
<p>The former Biden campaign aide’s unearthed ties to the controversial, Chinese Communist Party-controlled app comes amidst renewed calls to ban it in the U.S.</p>
<p>Vishal Disawar, who is the Global Program Manager of Integrity Products at TikTok, worked for the Biden campaign from August to November 2020.</p>
<p>“Led the nation-wide product strategy and technical program management for voter outreach and improving volunteer + voter experiences on campaign tech platforms across 5 product teams and 7 program teams,” explains his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdisawar/">LinkedIn</a> profile.</p>
<p>Disawar lists additional ways he helped Biden’s campaign efforts including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritized + scoped improvements and developed strategic implementation guidance for volunteer-facing products involved in voter outreach to enable the campaign to make 332M calls on ThruTalk, send 334M texts on ThruText, and have 200K volunteer-to-friend conversations via the Vote Joe mobile app.</li>
<li>Drove process improvements to handle product feedback and roll-outs across 17 battleground state program teams.</li>
<li>Led the joebiden.com website growth strategy for voter engagement to drive 19K voter registration &amp; vote by mail registration conversions, and 30K polling location lookups in battleground states.</li>
<li>Expanded voter outreach by an additional 247K conversations over a $2M spend in the final 3 weeks by managing a chatbot-based advertising program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disawar appeared to leverage his experience and connections working on the Biden campaign to join TikTok in March 2022.</p>
<p>“<span>Leading efforts to identify product improvements to make to prevent &amp; cure integrity issues related to misinformation, elections, and impersonation for all content types including user generated content and state affiliated media,</span>” explains a summary of his role on his LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>The former Harris aide’s TikTok connections follow evidence revealing that TikTok’s parent company ByteDance <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/05/04/tiktok-taps-military-techie-as-ceo/">employs</a> former Chinese Communist Party officials, including individuals with military ties, to leadership roles and grants party members preferential treatment in its hiring process.</p>
<p>The app's founder and former CEO of its parent company has also pledged to use the company to "<a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2020/08/09/tiktok-socialist-values-founders/">promote</a> socialist core values" and devotion to the Chinese Communist Party in a 2018 statement.</p>
<p>TikTok's <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/gop-senators-biden-admin-trump-presidential-order-tiktok">threat</a> to national security and data privacy prompted the Trump administration to attempt to ban the platform from operating in the U.S., which was quashed by the Biden White House.</p>
<p>Beyond demonstrating close ties between the app and Democratic lawmakers, which decreases the likelihood of a TikTok ban in the U.S., it also calls into question the potential partisanship fueling the social media platform’s misinformation policies.</p>
