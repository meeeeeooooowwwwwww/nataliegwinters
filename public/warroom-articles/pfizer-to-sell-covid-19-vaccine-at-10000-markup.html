<p>Pfizer Inc. will sell its COVID-19 vaccines at a 10,000 percent markup in 2023 following record-breaking <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pfizer-expects-a-record-100-billion-in-revenue-this-year-thanks-to-covid-vaccines-and-treatments-11644356651">profits</a> in 2022.</p>
<p>Quartz reports:</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>The company announced on Oct. 20 that it intends to sell the covid vaccine, marketed under the brand name <a href="https://www.comirnaty.com/">Comirnaty</a>, for $110 to $130 per dose.</p>
<p>This is about four times the current selling price—and 100 times the estimated cost of manufacturing the vaccine.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://peoplesvaccine.org/supporters/">The People's Vaccine Alliance</a>, a coalition of over 100 organizations working to end vaccine inequity, Pfizer spends less than $1.20 to produce each dose of vaccine. This estimate was drawn from an analysis conducted by <a href="https://webassets.oxfamamerica.org/media/documents/The_Great_Vaccine_Robbery_Policy_Brief.pdf?_gl=1*vhzenx*_ga*MjI3NDExNDAzLjE2NjU2Njg4MzE.*_ga_R58YETD6XK*MTY2NjM0MTgzNS41LjAuMTY2NjM0MjA4OC42MC4wLjA.">international nonprofit Oxfam</a>, based <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/how-to-make-enough-vaccine-for-the-world-in-one-year/">on data from</a> consumer advocacy Public Citizen and the Imperial College, London.</p>
<p>Pfizer has not challenged the estimate, which would imply that the 2023 price represents a 10,000% markup over the manufacturing cost.</p>
