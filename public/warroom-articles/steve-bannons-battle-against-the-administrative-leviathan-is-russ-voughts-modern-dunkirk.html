<p>In a recent  WarRoom discussion,  Steve Bannon and Russ Vought have vividly employed metaphors like the “ships of Dunkirk” and “Leviathan” to depict a struggle against an entrenched and overbearing administrative state in the United States. These powerful metaphors illustrate their view of an existential battle for the country’s future, highlighting themes of heroic resistance, deep-seated opposition, and a call to return to foundational principles found in the US Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Central to the Bannon-Vought argument is the notion of “radical constitutionalism.”</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong> Vought explains, about his group’s work “It is not to reinterpret the Constitution; it is to go back to the Constitution and put yourself in the position of the founders and how they would have responded.” This theme emphasizes a return to the original intent and framework of the Constitution as a solution to what they see as a “post-constitutional reality” created by the left’s incremental encroachments over the past century.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The metaphor, use by Bannon, of the “Leviathan” has deep roots, originating from biblical references to a formidable sea monster and famously employed by political philosopher Thomas Hobbes to describe a powerful and often oppressive government. Bannon and Vought use this metaphor to characterize the battle and the resistance over the modern administrative state.</p>
<p>Vought joined Bannon on the WarRoom on Wednesday and together they discussed how the left has constructed a “fourth branch of government” or a shadow government that operates beyond the reach of traditional Constitutional checks and balances, creating a bureaucratic “Leviathan” that controls various aspects of American life through an intricate web of regulations and federal rules.</p>
<p>Bannon elaborates on the secret expansion of government powers and authorities, stating, “This is how they created the Leviathan right? And this is how they had these spending bills to feed the Leviathan. This is how the Leviathan controls every aspect of your life.” The Leviathan represents not just bureaucratic bloat, but a system that undermines the principles of constitutional governance by shifting power away from elected officials and towards an unaccountable administrative apparatus.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Leviathan stands Vought’s metaphor of the “ships of Dunkirk.” This refers to the remarkable rescue operation during World War II, where a diverse fleet of civilian and military vessels evacuated Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, under dire circumstances. For Bannon and Vought, these metaphors joined together symbolize the urgent, grassroots mobilization required to confront and dismantle the modern day, oppressive administrative state.</p>
<p>Vought captures this sentiment, talking about the actions taken by his group  <a href="https://americarenewing.com/">Center for Renewing America</a>, “We are trying to rally to our cause these ships of Dunkirk so that we are ready with the types of battle plans that are necessary to save the country.”</p>
<p>This metaphor reflects a call to action, urging ordinary citizens and dedicated activists to unite in a heroic effort against a seemingly insurmountable foe. It conveys a sense of desperation but also of hope and determination, akin to the Dunkirk evacuation’s spirit of resilience and collective effort.</p>
<p>However the corporate media do not see either Bannon or Vought as heroes.  During the Wednesday segment with Vought, Bannon played footage of heated attacks on Vought and his background by the left-driven corporate media, calling his plans to return to a Constitutional America dangerous and radical.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bannon and Vought continue to argue that true adherence to constitutional principles involves direct confrontation with the administrative state, dismantling the structures that have grown outside the constitutional framework.</p>
<p>This  action includes reducing the power of unelected bureaucrats and reasserting the primacy of elected officials and traditional checks and balances, thereby returning the power of the government to the people.</p>
<p>The metaphors of the “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Leviathan-Middle-Eastern-mythology">Leviathan</a>” and the “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Dunkirk-evacuation">ships of Dunkirk</a>” poignantly illustrate the perceived battle lines in this ideological struggle. For Bannon and Vought, the fight against the administrative state is not just a policy disagreement but a fundamental clash over the future direction of American governance and the relevance of the US Constitution as a focal point for civil liberties.</p>
<p>By invoking these powerful images, they aim to inspire a broad, determined coalition to rise to the challenge, much like the small boats that saved an army at Dunkirk, to reclaim constitutional governance from the grasp of an overreaching Leviathan.</p>
<p><strong>Important point: The heart of the panic for the opponents of the US Constitution is the organized  battle plan called: <a href="https://www.project2025.org/">PROJECT 2025, that is where you can be WarRoom’s Next Man Up.</a></strong></p>
