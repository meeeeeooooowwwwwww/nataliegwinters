<p><strong>Why is Rep. Mike Rogers so opposed to the prospect of a Speaker Jim Jordan? Even pledging to “work with Democrats” to stop the Trump-endorsed <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/10/mike-rogers-will-not-back-jim-jordan-for-speaker-of-the-house-would-work-with-democrats.html">candidate</a>?</strong></p>
<p>In short: Rep. Rogers, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, is bought and paid for by the defense industry.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2022/11/16/the-arms-industrys-dream-representative-pentagon-pork-and-mr-rogers-neighborhood/?sh=d626dcd43ef9">was</a> the top recipient of weapons industry contributions in the 2022 election cycle, at a hefty figure of over $440,000. Some of his top contributors <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mike-d-rogers/summary?cid=N00024759&amp;cycle=2022">include</a> Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and L3Harris Technologies.</p>
<p><em>Forbes </em>even called him the “Arms Industry’s Dream Representative.” The same industry that desperately wants aid to Ukraine to continue.</p>

<p>Rep. Rogers also <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/news/press-releases/rogers-leads-codel-romania-and-poland-oversee-ukraine-aid">led</a> the Congressional Delegation tasked with “conducting oversight of the U.S. aid being sent to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Despite massive evidence of money laundering and improper use of funds, Rep. Rogers said the trip left him “<a href="https://insidedefense.com/daily-news/rogers-confident-us-aid-ukraine-after-oversight-trip">confident</a>” in U.S. aid packages to the notoriously corrupt country.</p>

<p>“We came away with a clear understanding of the various safeguards the U.S. government, in partnership with the Ukrainians and other nations, have put in place to ensure each article is accounted for and tracked to the frontline of the war,” he remarked.</p>
<p>The trip comes after his track record of repeatedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-texas-michael-mccaul-114e61bdd752d387a3df813638dab68a">pushing</a> for more <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-rogers-urge-admin-and-allies-to-swiftly-send-ukraine-weapons-needed-to-win/">aid</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/us/politics/republicans-ukraine-aid.html">Ukraine</a> – and lamenting to the mainstream media about his colleagues who feel otherwise.</p>
<p>With Republicans like this, who even needs Democrats? Well, apparently Rep. Rogers <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/10/mike-rogers-will-not-back-jim-jordan-for-speaker-of-the-house-would-work-with-democrats.html">does</a>.</p>
