<p>On Tuesday’s episode of the WarRoom program, Steve Bannon hosted Mike Davis, the founder of the Article 3 Project, for an in-depth discussion on various legal and political issues surrounding former President Donald J. Trump and the current state of the Justice Department. The conversation, marked by strong accusations and bold statements, centered on the corruption within the Biden administration and its impact on Trump, his supporters, and his Presidential campaign.</p>

<div>During the Davis segment on the WarRoom, Bannon highlighted a “bombshell” and breaking news regarding Davis filing criminal referrals against a senior DOJ member. This action stemmed from allegations of perjury and false statements made by the official during confirmation hearings. Davis and Bannon underscored these developments as pivotal in exposing corruption within the Biden administration’s Justice Department.</div>

<p>Bannon opened the discussion by highlighting concerns about a gag order that could prevent Trump from communicating with key figures, including Davis and Bannon.</p>
<p>This context set the stage for Davis to address broader allegations against the Justice Department, which he characterized as hermetically sealed and deeply corrupt since the Watergate era. Bannon asserted that the current situation mirrored the historical scandal where legal apparatuses were allegedly used to orchestrate a coup against President Nixon.</p>
<p>Davis supported Bannon’s claims, emphasizing that gag orders should protect criminal defendants, not serve as shields for a corrupt government. He accused the Biden administration and its prosecutors of engaging in “Republic-ending lawfare” against Trump, pointing to unprecedented legal actions against the former president. Specifically, Davis highlighted the raid on Mar-a-Lago, suggesting that it was politically motivated and involved concocted evidence, which he deemed criminal.</p>
<p>The conversation also touched upon a significant revelation involving Kristen Clarke, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. Davis accused Clarke of perjury during her confirmation hearings, citing an incident from 2006 where she allegedly assaulted her then-husband. He argued that Clarke’s dishonesty would have prevented her confirmation had the truth been known, thus labeling her appointment as part of the broader corruption within the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Bannon echoed Davis’s sentiments, describing the Civil Rights Division as a <strong>“massive nest of vipers”</strong> and criticizing Clarke for aggressively targeting pro-life activists while allegedly giving leniency to those supporting radical agendas. Davis’s accusations extended to Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, whom he accused of leading a criminal conspiracy against Trump and his associates.</p>
<p>Bannon and Davis agreed that Garland and other high-ranking officials, such as Lisa Monaco, should face criminal charges for their roles in what they described as a politicized and weaponized Justice Department. They called for immediate and rigorous investigations to hold these officials accountable, asserting that no one should be above the law, a principle they claimed Garland himself had frequently violated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Bannon and Davis’s discussion was marked by strong allegations of systemic corruption within the Justice Department, focusing on the injustices against Trump and his allies.</p>
<p>Davis’s call to action included filing multiple complaints against Kristen Clarke and urging future administrations to pursue criminal probes against current officials.</p>
