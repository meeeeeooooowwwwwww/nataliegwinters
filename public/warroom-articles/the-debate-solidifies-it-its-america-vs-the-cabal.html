<p><span>If you had suspicions that we’ve been living in a political simulation, Tuesday night’s debate just confirmed it. How is it possible that two "journalists” can host a debate eight weeks after one of the candidates standing on stage </span><i><span>was shot</span></i><span>, and not ask about it?</span></p>
<p><span>When, in brief passing, President Trump brought up the fact that </span><i><span>he was shot</span></i><span>, the ABC News "moderator” David Muir cut him off. "We have a lot to get to,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span>Oh, yes. They had a tight script, and they had to stick to it. There would be no mention of real news or real scandals, or any of the </span><a href="https://warroom.org/how-do-i-know-theyre-going-to-cheat-because-they-already-are/"><span>unending list</span></a><span> of schemes they’ve tried to stop President Trump from retaking the White House. They would keep it poll-tested, and completely devoid of reality. Lots of questions on abortion, climate change, January 6th, and Ukraine, less about the price of groceries, crime, or, I don’t know, how our country is going to hell and everyone knows it. </span></p>
<p><span>No, what we got was the latest choreographed performance in a long line of bad political choreographed performances. What they have "to get to” is installing another fake president. They don’t have time to reflect on major historic events that occurred not even two months ago, with the crime scene barely dry from being hosed down by the FBI. </span></p>
<p><span>What we got was a scripted politician lie for two hours straight trying to convince you that she’s not actually supposed to be in power right now, with the help of two Fake News script readers and "debate” rules designed to limit President Trump’s effectiveness while propping up the worst vice president in American history. There is no audience because they would laugh someone off the stage for stating, "it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy” with a straight face. The mics are muted because it limits the opportunity for, well, real debate, and President Trump’s </span><a href="https://x.com/rogerjstonejr/status/1833644505184014549?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>notorious one liners</span></a><span>. They must keep the environment as little of life and as dead as possible. That makes it easier for those without souls.</span></p>
<p><span>But there was one moment where a pre-scripted line actually made the situation we’re facing in America crystal clear. </span></p>
<p><span>It was when Kamala Harris </span><a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1833712374185947385?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>bragged</span></a><span> about having 200 endorsements from Bush, Romney, and McCain Republicans, making it obvious that this fight is not about Republicans against Democrats. It’s the corrupt political class against the People. </span></p>
<p><span>You see, they want you to believe someone can lead the greatest nation on earth after receiving zero votes, giving one softball </span><a href="https://x.com/jasonmillerindc/status/1829343409569755290?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>16-minute interview</span></a><span> (with a </span><a href="https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1830336761513533776?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>chaperone</span></a><span>), and doing one debate (with the help of two teammates). They’d be no different than Bush or Gore, or Kerry, or McCain, or Obama, or Romney. They’ll all interchangeable. They’re all controlled. And they’re all not actually running anything. </span></p>
<p><span>"Why did the moderators need Kamala Harris there at all?” </span><a href="https://x.com/megynkelly/status/1833694365631279115?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>asked</span></a><span> Megyn Kelly. Of course, the answer is they didn’t. Any mediocre corrupt career politician would do. As long as they have a pulse, and enough compromising material to keep them in check. They were happy to use a husk for over 4 years, until he </span><a href="https://warroom.org/that-was-not-a-debate-it-was-a-set-up/"><span>outlived his usefulness</span></a><span>. They’re not even pretending he’s running the country anymore. She wouldn’t be, either.</span></p>
<p><span>But really, all they need is a name, just like their millions of phantom voters. A fake candidate’s name for the top of the ballot, to be cast by a name on a voter list, tallied on a </span><a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1833552234908377477?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>wide open election system</span></a><span>. The debates are just another  pre-programmed event in a series of pre-programmed events to keep up the illusion that we still even live in a democracy anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>President Trump never needed a script. He wins even when they rig the game against him. That’s what America needs to do on Nov. 5, and end the political simulations once and for all.</span></p>
