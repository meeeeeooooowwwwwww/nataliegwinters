<h3>Why Jan 6th Matters for Voters, According to Rep. Eli Crane</h3>
<h5>Arizona Congressman <a href="https://x.com/EliCrane_CEO">Eli Crane</a> appeared on the WarRoom election election program with Steve Bannon and is raising concerns about transparency and accountability within the Secret Service following January 6th, 2021. He believes voters need to understand what’s at stake, especially as new details about communication protocols emerge. According to Crane, there’s an urgent need for voters to know about these issues and hold government agencies accountable for events like July 13 when there was an assassination attempt on President Trump.</h5>
<p>Crane told Bannon that transparency issues related to January 6th have potentially serious implications, describing how the Secret Service allegedly restricted communication channels after the event. "If these reports are accurate,” Crane said, "this is a massive failure of accountability – or even worse, a cover-up.”</p>
<h3>Bottom Line for Voters: Transparency in Government Matters</h3>
<p>As Election Day nears, Crane wants voters to understand why these issues matter. He insists that addressing potential cover-ups isn’t just a political talking point—it’s a fundamental responsibility. Crane encouraged voters to consider the importance of government transparency when they head to the polls.</p>
<p>"Remember, it’s your government. These bureaucracies work for you, not the other way around,” he concluded. For Crane, a vote for accountability and transparency is for a stronger, more trustworthy government.</p>

<h3>Communication Restrictions Post-Jan 6th</h3>
<p>Crane shared that the DHS Inspector General recently sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. This letter flagged troubling restrictions on Secret Service communications immediately following January 6th, allegedly limiting agents’ ability to engage in group chats and send photos using government-issued phones.</p>
<p>According to Crane, "These limitations force agents to use their personal phones for official communications, even when operating overseas.” This poses two key risks: compromised security and reduced accountability. "Using private phones,” he explained, "means it’s a lot harder for investigators to access critical communications when they need it most.”</p>
<h3>Why This Matters to Voters</h3>
<p>Crane argues that understanding these potential cover-ups is vital for voters. He points out that government transparency is foundational for a functioning democracy, particularly in matters involving public safety and crisis response. With allegations that Secret Service agents were told to switch to personal devices after January 6th, Crane sees a pattern he believes is meant to "circumvent oversight and reduce transparency.”</p>
<p>For Crane, the timing is significant. "This protocol change happened right after January 6th,” he said. "It looks to me, and to others watching this closely, like an intentional move to prevent Congress from fully investigating what went down.”</p>
<h3>Accountability Is Key</h3>
<p>Voters should demand transparency, Crane emphasized, because these communication gaps can hinder critical investigations. Not having access to complete records means potentially missing out on important information. Crane explained, "When federal agencies start taking steps to avoid oversight, it’s a red flag – we need accountability at every level of government.”</p>
<p>Crane made it clear that for him, this isn’t just about one event. It’s a broader concern about federal agencies potentially evading their responsibilities to the American public. “This is one more reason why this election is so important,” Crane said. "Our bureaucracies need an overhaul, and voters need to know what they’re up against.”</p>
<h3>The Broader Implications: Security and Trust</h3>
<p>Crane’s revelations also raised concerns about national security. Secret Service agents using personal phones could expose sensitive information to potential hacking or foreign threats. "It’s reckless and endangers everyone,” Crane stated, arguing that voters should know if the agencies meant to protect them are potentially compromising security.</p>
<p>In his view, this is about restoring trust and ensuring government accountability. "We’re seeing more and more attempts to go around established rules,” Crane said. "It’s up to the American people to demand better.”</p>
