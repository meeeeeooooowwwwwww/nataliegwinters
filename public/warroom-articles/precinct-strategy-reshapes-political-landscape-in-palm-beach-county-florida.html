<p>Isaac Arnsdorf’s illuminating book “Finish What We Started” sheds light on the potent force of grassroots political movements today- for driving tangible change like the nation has never seen from Republicans.</p>
<p>In fact, when the WarRoom Posse actively engages in civic participation, it often stirs discomfort among Democrats. The Democratic party finds itself frightened when motivated, astute, and empowered Americans assume leadership roles within the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Arnsdorf’s book’s full title- tells you what the opponents of America First are afraid of: “Finish What We Started: The MAGA Movement’s Ground War to End Democracy.”  The book offers a somewhat scary narrative of the Republican Party’s mass radicalization post-January 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Arnsdorf explores the rise of a radical right-wing faction determined to transform the Republican party, focusing on ordinary Americans- and that is frightening to the status quo in politics.</p>
<p>We know that the Democrats are afraid of people with such plans.</p>
<p>However, Republicans aren’t always jubilant about these shifts either. This dynamic is particularly evident in the recent political metamorphosis witnessed in Palm Beach County, Florida. Here, Kelly Collins of the Palm Beach GOP and Steve Bannon, renowned host of the WarRoom, have played pivotal roles in orchestrating profound changes in local politics.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are scared about that as well.</p>
<p>Bannon’s promotion of the innovative Precinct Strategy on the WarRoom has catalyzed this transformation. At the same time, Collins has diligently led efforts from the ground level with the help of her local WarRoom posse.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Collins appeared on the WarRoom to tell her inspiring Precinct Strategy story:</p>
<p>The conversation between Collins and Bannon highlights the climactic role of Republican grassroots activism in reshaping the Republican Party in places like Palm Beach County, Florida.</p>
<p>It is likely to inspire passion and motivation in towns and cities nationwide where the footage of Collins’ enthusiasm is viewed.</p>
<p>Collins told Bannon the movement’s power lies in realizing the untapped potential within the Republican Party’s ranks. Collins remarked, “I didn’t really realize until hearing about it on the WarRoom that there are almost 400,000 open precincts. Then I thought, ‘ I could do that—I can do something,’ echoing Arnsdorf’s exploration of how ordinary citizens can become agents of change when they recognize their power.</p>
<p>Collins talked about an election audit:</p>

<p>"The Stats Were Saying Otherwise.” Palm Beach County Republican Party Secretary Kelly Collins On Battle To Get Election Audit <a href="https://t.co/d54yFBPd6r">pic.twitter.com/d54yFBPd6r</a></p>
<p>— Jayne Zirkle (@JayneZirkle) <a href="https://twitter.com/JayneZirkle/status/1790542903590195566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The journey to transform the GOP was not without its challenges. Collins and her fellow activists encountered resistance from establishment figures in the party, who were unwilling to embrace change.</p>
<p>However, the grassroots activists—whom the posse calls “Force Multipliers”—hung in there and remained persistent.</p>
<p>Now, they are comfortably electing Republicans who support President Trump and America First policies.</p>
<p>Collins told Bannon about the strategy her group used to enhance voter outreach. She stressed the importance of reaching voters multiple times through various channels. This strategy proved successful, resulting in a remarkable increase in electoral victories and fundraising achievements.</p>
<p>Collins’s account of the movement’s impact reflects Arnsdorf’s exploration of grassroots movements as catalysts for change.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>She noted, “We went from a 30% win rate in the county to almost 60% wins in our municipals,” illustrating the tangible outcomes of grassroots organizing.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The success of the Precinct movement in Palm Beach County serves as a testament to the power of grassroots activism in shaping local politics. As Bannon remarked, “Once you start winning… Everybody wants in,” underscoring the contagious nature of success and the transformative potential of grassroots movements.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Collins and Bannon emphasized the importance of continued grassroots engagement. Collins urged individuals to get involved, stating, “You just do the best, you know, take the next right step,” echoing Bannon’s call to action for ordinary citizens to participate actively in the political process.</p>
<p>As Arnsdorf’s book “Finish What we Started” illustrates, grassroots movements have the power to challenge the status quo and create a more inclusive and representative political system. In Palm Beach County, grassroots activists have shown that individuals can make a difference when they come together with a shared vision and purpose.</p>
<p>The only scary thing about this is that it is not the Democrats making this change, and they can not stop Republicans from making things change. Otherwise, this is pretty much normal civics.</p>
