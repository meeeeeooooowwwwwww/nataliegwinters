<p>In a Tuesday WarRoom conversation between Dave Brat and Michele Bachmann, Bachmann expressed deep concerns about the Biden administration’s recent executive order, which she argues represents a significant shift in power within the U.S. government. Bachmann, a former congresswoman, highlighted this executive order’s implications, which delegates presidential powers to the Secretaries of Treasury and State. Her insights into the administrative state reflect a growing concern about centralized power and its impact on democracy and governance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This executive order essentially sidelines the traditional checks and balances by concentrating unprecedented power in the hands of a few, bypassing not just the Vice President but potentially the entire legislative process,” Bachmann told Brat.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bachmann opened the discussion by explaining the executive order signed by President Joe Biden. She stated, “This executive order is delegating presidential powers to the Secretaries of Treasury and Secretary of State, both as to the Ukraine slush fund and to future executive orders.”</p>
<p>This move, according to Bachmann, underscores a significant shift in how executive powers are wielded, bypassing traditional structures like the Vice President. “So, if you want to know who’s in charge, I would start there,” she emphasized, pointing to the two Secretaries now holding significant sway in the administration.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the broader implications of this shift in power. Bachmann argued that this executive order is not a one-off action but part of a larger pattern where “the people who’ve been playing President behind the scenes for three and a half years are thoroughly in charge now.” She noted the urgency of this situation, suggesting that those in control “intend to complete whatever plans they have prior to the next political puppet moving into the White House come January 24.”</p>
<p>In discussing the motivations behind these moves, Bachmann touched upon the concept of global governance, which she sees as a threat to American sovereignty. She remarked, “The whole focus of this is to bring down the United States of America, to push the United States into a global governance situation that is opposite of President Trump. He is the anti-globalist president.” This perspective aligns with the broader narrative often espoused by the War Room, which views globalism as antithetical to American interests and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Bachmann also expressed skepticism about the narrative surrounding COVID-19, especially in light of the timing of the executive order. She cited data discrepancies, questioning the United States’ reporting on COVID-19 deaths compared to other countries. “Joe Biden is this aberration when nobody has COVID; somehow he has COVID and he’s still able to sign executive orders,” she noted, suggesting a potential cover-up or manipulation of information to justify certain political maneuvers.</p>
<p>In response to Brat’s question about the importance of appointing the right leaders, Bachmann advocated for putting “Grassroots leaders” in charge of key positions rather than “Wall Street globalists.” She stressed the importance of choosing individuals who prioritize “American sovereignty” and “reject global governance,” aligning with President Trump’s America First policy.</p>
<p>Bachmann’s insights reveal a deep-seated concern about the administrative state and its role in shaping policy and governance. Her comments underscore the tension between national sovereignty and global governance, reflecting a broader debate about the direction of American democracy and the principles that underpin it.</p>
