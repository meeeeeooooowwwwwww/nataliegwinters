<p>Reflecting Steve Bannon’s ethos, acting host of WarRoom on Saturday, Dave Brat set the tone of the program- absent Bannon- with a solemn dedication: “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we’re going after the truth—the truth that will save this Republic.”</p>
<p>Brat emphasizes Bannon’s directive to double efforts to save the American Republic: “Don’t send me mail, don’t send me heartfelt letters. No time for crying in the War Room.”</p>
<p>Recognizing Bannon’s irreplaceable presence, Brat asserted, “No one else can do what he does on a daily basis.” He acknowledges the WarRoom team’s dedication, naming “Grace, Mo, Cameron, and the Denver Crew.”</p>
<p>As Bannon marks July 4th in jail, Brat urges listeners to amplify the platform, prompting reflection on love and sacrifice. Drawing parallels to the Founding Fathers’ resolve against tyranny, Brat rallies, “We’re a nation of individuals under the law, guided by Judeo-Christian principles from Exodus and Deuteronomy.”</p>
<p>“What Steve wants us to do is redouble our efforts and keep this War Room churning out powerful information that motivates us all to take action,” Brat told the Posse. “Let’s do that for Steve on a human level, let us all pitch in here. What were the founders doing in 1776? They were battling it out against the greatest Empire on this Earth.”</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Bannon even pre-<a href="https://warroom.org/steve-bannons-powerful-words-ring-from-prison-about-the-grit-and-sacrifice-that-shaped-america/">recorded a solemn message</a> to be played for his audience on Independence Day, celebrating traditional American grit. So it was an eventful week and the posse and the staff all held it together.</p>
<p>And just one day after Bannon’s incarceration, the WarRoom became the intense target of the <a href="https://warroom.org/lincoln-projects-despicable-attack-on-steve-bannon-hammer-slams-moral-bankruptcy-of-disgusting-outfit-exposed/">Lincoln Project</a>, the <a href="https://x.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1808339119275147369">Harris-Biden campaign</a>, and other media sources over a WarRoom segment featuring<a href="https://warroom.org/roberts-upholding-constitutional-principles-amidst-lefts-illusion-about-the-minority-they-are/"> Brat and Kevin Roberts</a> of Project 2025.</p>
<p>By midweek, there was a viral social media <a href="https://warroom.org/warrooms-free-speech-rebellion-fuels-democracy-despite-lefts-attempts-to-silence-us/">smear campaign.</a></p>
<p>The week ended with the Harris -Biden team continuing to invoke Bannon as their top enemy by <a href="https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1809274690239603031">retweeting</a> a clip of Bannon.</p>
<p>Yet, his team persisted.</p>
<p>Bannon’s resilient ‘RagTag’ staff, show hosts, and producers from Real America’s Voice triumphantly navigated their inaugural week as Bannon served time at Danbury, CT’s Federal Correctional Facility. His confinement stemmed from defying a congressional subpoena related to the January 6, 2021, events, which Bannon and the 2024 US House branded an unconstitutional Democrat-led House Committee probe.</p>
<p>Critics like Madeline Peltz from Media Matters expressed doubts in a <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/steve-bannon/where-steve-bannon-leaves-us">recent article</a>: “To be sure, War Room will suffer without him in the short term. For the past several years, the show has been the center of the MAGA media universe, and neither his proposed list of guest hosts nor his <strong>ragtag staff</strong> will be able to supplant his relentless work ethic and talent for far-right messaging. While it’s possible he’ll get messages out through other media figures, his ability to communicate will surely be diminished during this period, and that is a blow to his movement.”</p>
<p>Despite detractors like Media Matters, it was a full week of excellent hosts and guests moving the America First agenda ahead.</p>
<p>On Monday, Bannon walked into prison on his own, <a href="https://warroom.org/outside-of-jail-steve-bannon-said-he-expects-fair-treatment-from-bureau-of-prisons-amid-unhinged-left/">expecting fair treatment</a> and expressing no worry about mistreatment. By Tuesday, he had sent word through a top aide that he was okay, finding the prison well-ordered and he was adjusting well.</p>
<p>Bannon’s final words in freedom to his staff and supporters were a directive to accept the “<a href="https://warroom.org/steve-bannon-speaks-to-peoples-convention-and-summons-next-man-up/">Next Man Up</a>” position.</p>

<p>Perhaps next time Ms. Peltz will call the WarRoom team a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S649UkPr54">Yankee Doodles</a>?</p>
