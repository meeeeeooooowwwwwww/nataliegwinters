<h4>The co-founder and President of Unity Consortium â€" a non-profit group working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to convince parents to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 â€" is a healthcare consultant whose clients include Pfizer Inc.</h4>
<p>In an apparent conflict of interest, Unity Consortium is also <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/about-us/">partnered</a> with Pfizer Inc., which manufactures the same COVID-19 vaccines and boosters the group is promoting, and other pharmaceutical companies. The group also lists one of its official "<a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/about-us/#members">liaisons</a>" as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recently voted in favor of adding the Covid vaccine to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html">recommended immunization schedule</a> for children.</p>

<p>Unity Consortium, which seeks to “raise adolescent and young adult vaccination rates,” was founded by pharmaceutical industry veteran Judy <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/about-us/#members">Klein</a>. Klein is also the founder of inKlein Consulting, whose website <a href="https://archive.ph/EWEVy">reveals</a> that one of its primary clients is Pfizer.</p>
<figure><figcaption>inKlein clients.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Klein’s bio on the Unity Consortium website, however, fails to disclose any of her financial links to the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer.</p>
<p>Unity Consortium has launched an aggressive campaign to encourage parents to make their children receive a COVID-19 vaccine, even <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Unity-letter-to-HCPs-1.pdf">lobbying </a>healthcare <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Unity-letter-to-HCPs-1.pdf">providers</a> to instruct their patients to receive COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>The non-profit, which has hosted pro-COVID-19-vaccine events in partnership with Chelsea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWIDkLpwy3A&amp;ab_channel=UnityConsortium">Clinton</a>, distributed a fact <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AS_UNITY_FactSheet_2021_NovemberUpdate_04.pdf">sheet</a> to healthcare providers in 2021, instructing them to “encourage parents and teens to schedule well-visits and routine and COVID-19 vaccinations”</p>
<p>“Use clear, confident and accessible language when recommending vaccines to parents and teens,” insisted the group.</p>
<p>Unity Consortium has also crafted social media posts for users to share that encourage COVID-19 vaccination, <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/dontwaitvaccinate/">including</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We're part of @UnityConsortium's "Don't Wait. Vaccinate" campaign! Adolescents need their routine vaccinations AND the COVID-19 vaccine! Learn more: https://bit.ly/3e0KY98 #dontwaitvaccinate”</p></blockquote>
<div>It has also attempted to intervene in the relationship between healthcare providers and their patients, offering drafts of email and text messages to incentivize COVID-19 vaccination.</div>
<div>“Adolescents should be vaccinated even if they have had COVID-19 previously. Highly contagious variants continue to spread,” reads one <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HCP-template-email-letter-to-patients-4.docx">draft</a> before adding, “<span>Most side effects are mild and last a couple of days. Getting vaccinated is the safer choice.”</span></div>
<div>
<figure><figcaption>Draft letter.</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<div>Unity Consortium also encouraged healthcare providers to contact their patients via <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HCP-template-text-messages-to-patients-1.docx">text</a> with drafted messages including “Adolescents should get the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have had COVID-19 previously. Call us at [XXX-XXX-XXXX] to schedule an appointment. It is safe to visit.” and “Billions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have been given with significant benefits and limited risks. We recommend that your teen be vaccinated. Call us at [XXX-XXX-XXXX]. It is safe to visit.”</div>
<div>
<div>Unity Consortium’s Judy Klein has also been <a href="https://archive.ph/pPPaQ#selection-343.0-346.0">quoted</a> in mainstream media articles urging adolescent vaccination, such as <span>“Gen Z Wants to ‘Wait a Little Bit’ to Get COVID Vaccine. Experts Say There’s No Time to Waste.” </span></div>
</div>
<div>The USAToday, however, fails to disclose any of Klein’s ties to Pfizer:</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>"Now is the window of opportunity,” Judy Klein â€" president of Unity Consortium, a nonprofit that advocates for vaccine protection for adolescents and young adults â€" told USA TODAY. If high rates of unvaccinated students show up at schools, that’s a recipe for  coronavirus outbreaks and yet another semester derailed by the virus, she fears.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Amidst Unity Consortium’s efforts to increase the number of children receiving COVID-19 vaccines, it has omitted any mention of the product’s true side effects.</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>On its “<span>COVID-19 and Adolescents” <a href="https://www.unity4teenvax.org/covid-19-adolescents/">information</a> page, Unity Consortium suggests that “arm soreness” is the primary side effect:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>“Some people have reported arm soreness at the injection site, which generally goes away quickly. Some people experience short-term <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">side effects after being vaccinated, such as </a>tiredness, headache, or chills. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they typically go away in a few days. These are normal signs that your body is building protection.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As revealed by scientists including Dr. Robert Malone, COVID-19 vaccination in children has the propensity to cause life-threatening cardiac <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/higher-risk-myocarditis-death-covid-vaccines-et/">problems</a> and affect <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-confirms-link-between-covid-19-vaccination-temporary-increase-menstrual-cycle-length">hormonal</a> cycles and reproductive <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Athenationalpulse.com+sperm&amp;oq=site%3Athenationalpulse.com+sperm&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.3294j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">organs</a>.</p>
