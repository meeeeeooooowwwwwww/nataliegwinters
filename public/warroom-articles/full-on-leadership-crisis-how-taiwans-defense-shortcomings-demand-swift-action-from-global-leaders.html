<p>The escalating tension between Taiwan and China, as discussed by Col. John Mills on War Room with Peter Navarro, sheds light on a global leadership crisis. Their Monday conversation highlighted Taiwan’s increasing concerns over China’s potential military action, specifically the possibility of a quarantine mimicking the Cuban Missile Crisis. With China ramping up its defense spending and Taiwan anticipating action within the next six months, the time for swift, strategic leadership is now.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>As Col. Mills pointed out, Taiwan’s citizens overwhelmingly prefer U.S. leadership under Trump, as they see it as more supportive of their defense needs. “Hands down, they want Trump,” Mills said, underlining the importance of strong leadership that Taiwan can rely on.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Col. Mills, who has been closely monitoring Taiwan’s situation, reported that Taiwan expects China to impose a “quarantine” to block critical sea and air traffic.</p>
<p>He explained, "They expect a quarantine, maybe within six months,” highlighting the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>The stakes are high, as a blockade could cripple Taiwan economically while avoiding the legal definition of an act of war. This kind of tactic, reminiscent of Cold War strategies, underscores the need for bold leadership from both Taiwan and its allies.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges Taiwan faces is a severe backlog in its defense procurement, with delayed weapons deliveries hampering the country’s readiness to defend itself. As Mills noted, “There’s a huge backlog at the Tucson Raytheon plant. There’s just no way they can catch up.” The delays are caused by supply chain bottlenecks and bureaucratic slowdowns within the Biden administration, which has been slow to sign critical contracts.</p>
<h4>POOR LEADERSHIP FROM BIDEN-HARRIS CAUSED THIS MESS FOR TAIWAN</h4>
<p>"The Biden administration is very slow at getting contracts signed,” Mills pointed out, emphasizing the urgency for a more efficient process. Without timely access to critical military equipment, Taiwan is left vulnerable, further exacerbating the geopolitical tension in the region.</p>
<p>This backlog is not just a logistical issue; it’s a leadership issue. To resolve it, global leaders need to prioritize the defense needs of democratic allies like Taiwan. Streamlining the defense production process, cutting through red tape, and increasing manufacturing capacity are essential steps. Leadership on this front needs to be decisive. Mills suggested, “Co-production is the way to go,” referencing the need for Taiwan to gain production rights to produce some of its own defense equipment. This would not only accelerate Taiwan’s defense capabilities but also relieve pressure on the U.S. defense system, which is already overwhelmed with commitments to Ukraine and Israel.</p>
<p>Beyond procurement, leadership in both Taiwan and the U.S. needs to focus on strategic defense measures that can deter Chinese aggression. The “porcupine theory,” which promotes asymmetric warfare through the use of sea mines and submarines, is a promising defense strategy. However, as Mills noted, even these critical defense tools are being delayed: "Those mines are part of the backlog… very advanced AI-enabled mines, but they are part of the backlog.”</p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM IS WITH ALLIANCE BUILDING</h4>
<p>Another critical aspect of leadership involves solidifying alliances and ensuring clear, unwavering support for Taiwan from its global partners.</p>
<p>The defense of Taiwan is not just a matter of military hardware but a test of leadership on the global stage. Swift, strategic action is required to address the backlog in defense production and secure Taiwan’s ability to defend itself. Co-production agreements, enhanced manufacturing capacity, and a streamlined procurement process are all essential solutions. Moreover, global leaders must stand firm in their support of Taiwan, providing not only military aid but the confidence that they will not stand alone in the face of Chinese aggression. The time for leadership is now, and failure to act decisively could have profound consequences for global security.</p>
