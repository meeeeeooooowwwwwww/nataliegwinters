<p>Kris Mayes told a lot of lies in her statement announcing the unprecedented arrest of leaders of her political opposition for noncrimes last week.</p>
<p>She said she was elected to "uphold the law.” <a href="https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2023/04/rejected-provisionals-ballots-could-tilt-contested-attorney-general-race/">Wrong</a> and <a href="https://ktar.com/story/5566527/arizona-border-community-empathetic-but-growing-tired-of-migrant-crisis/">wrong</a>. She said the 2020 Election "was free and fair.” <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1513602321292345354?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w">Wrong</a>. And nothing says I "will not allow American democracy to be undermined” than by arresting the political opposition’s top election integrity lawyer in the middle of a presidential election.</p>
<p>But one thing Mayes said is correct. "Justice demands an answer to the efforts …to undermine the will of Arizona’s voters during the 2020 Presidential Election.” It was just her side who was doing the undermining.</p>
<p>Mayes claims having contingent electors in the case the courts did the right thing and actually heard the evidence of election fraud, like the alternate electors who were successful <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2023/05/15/the-lefts-2020-fake-electors-narrative-is-fake-news/">in 1960</a>, was a criminal "scheme.”</p>
<p>"The scheme, had it succeeded, would have deprived Arizona’s voters of their right to have their votes counted for their chosen president,” Mayes said. "It effectively would have made their right to vote meaningless.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is the reality Arizonans are living under, because of Mayes, Katie Hobbs, and the RINO Republicans in the Maricopa County election office, who have subverted the will of the voters in 2020 and 2022.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/e0/e04e630c-63ff-4bdb-9652-e0be3598b5d4/summary20of20election20fraud20in20the20swing20states.pdf%23page22">just a few examples</a> of how "democracy” was undermined in 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maricopa County accepted at least 20,000 mail-in ballots (but <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1783538113282703715?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w">likely more</a>) unlawfully after the election, according to <a href="https://verityvote.us/long-withheld-records-reveal-more-than-20000-mail-ballots-received-after-the-legal-deadline/">its own records</a>, which it covered up for seven months. The same officials who oversaw the corrupt election said this was fine, running to the propaganda pages of Reuters to claim the ballots were only transferred to Runbeck after the election, despite the forms clearing stating the surge of mail-in ballots were "post office inbound” on Nov. 4, 2020.</li>
<li>Over 420,000 mail-in ballots <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2023021006">failed</a> signature verification standards.</li>
<li>We the People Arizona Alliance hasidentified at least 76,354 egregious signature mismatches, which is over seven times the supposed election margin of 10,456 votes.</li>
<li>Maricopa County certified the election despite having <a href="https://verityvote.us/maricopa-dropbox-%2520chain-of-custody/">no documented chain of custody</a> for an astounding 740,000 drop box ballots, according to Verity Vote.</li>
<li>Ballot transport forms for over 80 percent of these votes had no ballot counts, meaning we just have to trust <a href="https://x.com/maricopavote/status/1590009384377384961?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w">these guys</a> that the numbers are what they say they are.</li>
<li>Speaking of which, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors <a href="https://youtu.be/hO_0fGFQ50I?si=TBp6JqZI4cuavWmS&amp;t=9273">admitted</a> they purged the system housing 2020 Election data and moved it the day before the Arizona audit began, and after they received a subpoena.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2020 Election wasn’t subverted by "fake electors.” There is no such thing. But there is such a thing as the Fake Elected, and they’re currently arresting their political opposition, facilitating an invasion of our country, and interfering in the 2024 Election. All in the name of "democracy.”</p>
