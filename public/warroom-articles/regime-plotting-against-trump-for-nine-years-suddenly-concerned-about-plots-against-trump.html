<p>In case you needed more proof the 2020 Election was stolen, Merrick Garland just announced that they’re going to try to kill President Trump again.</p>
<p>The regime is so terrified of President Trump and the Make America Great Again movement beating them for a third time that they’ve orchestrated efforts to smear him, bankrupt him, imprison him, and when all else has failed, kill him.</p>
<p>Garland recently took to NBC News, and deep state lackey Ken Dilanian, to announce he is very worried Iran will try to kill President Trump.</p>
<p>"<span>Our intelligence community has made clear that we believe </span>that the Iranians are attempting to kill or injure former high government officials,” Garland said. "This is an ongoing issue, we have ongoing investigations.”</p>
<p><span>"You don’t think we’ve seen the end?” </span>Dilanian prompted.</p>
<p>"<span>I don’t think we’ve seen the end</span> of Iranian plotting, no.”</p>
<p>Emphasis added. Like everything else in our politics, the only things that happen are what the intelligence community "makes clear” to their hatchet men. The intelligence community tells them what they believe, regardless if it’s true, and it hardly ever is. Iran is plotting to kill Trump just like Russia is "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-interfering-2024-election-help-trump-us-intelligence-officials-say"><span>interfering</span></a>” in the election. Another red herring trotted out via the Fake News media to divert attention from their own evil deeds. They are setting up the blame for the next attack on President Trump, and shifting it away from themselves.</p>
<p>It was not Iran who let eight shots be fired at    President Trump, hitting him in the ear, killing Corey Comperatore, and injuring two others. It was our own government that let that happen.</p>
<p>So why would Garland have a problem with plots against President Trump, anyway? His and the regime’s entire job has been plots against Trump for the past <span>nine years</span>.</p>
<p>He heads the same (In)Justice Department that, in concert with the "intelligence community,” illegally spied on him, tried to frame him for "collusion” with Russia, covered up the Lap Top From Hell, covered up how the election was stolen from him, <a href="https://revolver.news/2024/01/secret-service-foreknowledge-or-criminal-negligence-damning-new-evidence-surfaces-fbi-january-6-pipe-bomb-story/"><span>set up</span></a> January 6th to arrest him and his supporters as "domestic terrorists,” illegally raided his home, and indicted him 91 times on fake charges in the hopes of seeing him die in prison. But now, after the failed assasination attempt, Garland is suddenly worried about President Trump’s wellbeing. Doth protest too much.</p>
<p>So for anyone still clinging to politics as usual, where they feign outrage at cat lady jokes or pass around the "<a href="https://x.com/virtuemediacorp/status/1818248792187031556?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>weird</span></a>” talking points, it’s time to get serious. By the grace of God, President Trump, and America, is still here. But the world doesn’t want it that way. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%207:14&amp;version=KJV"><span>Pray</span></a> for our country.</p>
