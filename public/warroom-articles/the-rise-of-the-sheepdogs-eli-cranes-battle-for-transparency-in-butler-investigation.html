<p>On Saturday’s WarRoom with Jack Posobiec, U.S. Representative Eli Crane, a former Navy Seal sniper, discussed his investigation into the massive security breach during that notorious MAGA rally held in Butler, Pennsylvania, where President Donald Trump was shot in an attempted assassination.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> “There are people, we call them sheepdogs, within our government and law enforcement agencies who also don’t trust that this federal government and law enforcement will reveal to the American people exactly what’s going on,” Crane revealed to Posobiec. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Crane told the WarRoom audience that, along with Rep. Corey Mills and journalist Benny Johnson, they visited the site to conduct an independent review of the security measures, driven by a lack of trust in federal authorities to disclose the deadly details fully.</p>
<p>“This is my second time this week going to Butler, PA, to do an investigation,” Crane explained. “Most of us don’t trust the federal government to get to the bottom of this, and I think even fewer of us trust that they would actually relay it to the American people.”</p>
<p>Crane’s attitude about the government likely reflects a growing disillusionment among Americans who believe that federal agencies may not be transparent about their findings.</p>
<p>Crane highlighted his concern about security arrangements during the rally. “I don’t know who made the call for that rally to be held at that site in the first place. There were just way too many threats,” he said. The location’s inadequate security, particularly the absence of a full presidential protection package for Trump, was one of Crane’s primary criticisms.</p>
<p>“There were just way too many threats,” Crane asserted, pointing to the site’s high-risk nature for someone as high-profile as Trump, who he described as “one of the most loved but also one of the most hated men on planet Earth.”</p>
<p>One of the key revelations from the investigation was the failure to utilize available vantage points for counter-sniper teams, specifically the water tower near the venue. “I’ve been sounding the alarm on this that none of the counter-sniper teams got up in the water tower,” Crane said. This oversight raised significant questions about the planning and execution of security operations during the event.</p>
<p>The conversation also touched on “sheepdogs” within government and law enforcement, individuals who share the public’s skepticism about the federal narrative. According to Crane, this group of insiders plays a crucial role in ensuring accountability and transparency, as they are willing to challenge official accounts when necessary.</p>
<p>During the segment, Crane also pointed out specific incidents that highlighted the lack of coordination during the event, including reports of security personnel leaving their posts and difficulties accessing secure areas due to key card malfunctions. “I’m also hearing that one of the individuals went outside to find the shooter, and then his key card wasn’t working to get back into the building,” Crane noted, illustrating the chaotic nature of the security operations.</p>
<p>Crane expressed hope that a committee led by Speaker Johnson would investigate these lapses, emphasizing the need for members willing to pursue the truth. “I just wanted to put people on there that aren’t technically punchers, who are willing to actually be bold and courageous when they believe it might cost them,” he stated, recommending individuals like Clay Higgins for their experience and commitment to uncovering the truth.</p>
<p>Crane stressed the importance of independent oversight in government operations. By highlighting the role of “sheepdogs” and calling for more transparency, Crane and the WarRoom ensure that the American people are informed about the true nature of security challenges faced by public figures and events.</p>
