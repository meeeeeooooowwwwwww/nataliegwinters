<h5>BLUF: Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse appeared on Wednesday’s WarRoom and discussed the critical state of the House races and recounts. DeGrasse expressed optimism about the potential for Republicans to pick up several seats despite tough competition. Bannon emphasizes the importance of grassroots involvement and staying updated through official channels.</h5>
<h3>The Battle for the House</h3>
<p>In a recent conversation, Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse focused on the looming uncertainty of House races. Bannon pointed out that the situation is almost like a "poison chalice,” referring to the challenges the GOP faces under the leadership of figures like Speaker Jeffries and Rep. Jamie Raskin. He highlighted the ongoing nightmare of certifications and impeachments that have bogged down the House, but he remained hopeful about the GOP’s ability to hold onto power.</p>
<h3>Current House Race Status</h3>
<p>DeGrasse updated Bannon on the status of key races. In New York, three seats are still in play, but two of them are within the recount margin, which means the GOP could still win those. However, the Democrats have already claimed victory in two seats, with one still outstanding. The focus then shifted to California, where, according to local insiders, Republicans are optimistic about retaining their seats and possibly even gaining another one in Los Angeles.</p>
<h3>Importance of Grassroots Efforts</h3>
<p>DeGrasse urged Bannon’s followers to stay engaged. With recounts and ballot curing underway, DeGrasse encouraged people to get involved by becoming poll watchers or assisting with ballot counts. He suggested visiting local GOP offices for updates and volunteer opportunities, especially in Arizona, where the battle for Kari Lake’s seat continues to heat up.</p>
<h3>Where to Stay Updated</h3>
<p>For those looking to stay informed on the latest developments, DeGrasse recommended checking <a href="https://nrcc.org/">NRCC.org</a> for real-time updates on House race projections. He also emphasized the importance of having a unified front in this critical moment, with Republicans looking to dominate not only the House but the Senate and White House as well.</p>
<h3>Potential Gains for Republicans</h3>
<p>Despite the ongoing battles, Bannon expressed confidence that Republicans could still pick up three to four additional seats, giving them more breathing room. He also reassured Bannon that races like Joe Kent’s seat look good, though counting had been paused temporarily.</p>
<h3>The Bigger Picture: Full Spectrum Dominance</h3>
<p>As Bannon and DeGrasse discussed the broader political landscape, Bannon framed the fight as part of a larger goal for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-spectrum_dominance">full spectrum dominance</a>.” He pointed out that Republicans now control the House, Senate, and White House, with the Supreme Court also on their side. This historic shift, Bannon noted, is the result of years of hard work and grassroots mobilization.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts: A Great Day for the Movement</h3>
<p>DeGrasse ended the conversation by expressing his optimism for the future. He acknowledged the tough nature of the House races but stressed that the GOP is in a strong position. Bannon, too, shared his excitement, calling it a "great day” for the movement—especially due to the dedication of those working tirelessly behind the scenes.</p>
<h3>Stay Engaged: Social Media and Next Steps</h3>
<p>For those looking to follow the action, DeGrasse encouraged viewers to follow him on social media platforms like <a href="https://x.com/Degrasse81">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a href="https://gettr.com/user/degrasse">Getter.</a> He emphasized that the hard work is far from over, but the momentum is clearly on the side of Republicans as they push forward in these pivotal races.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>The conversation between Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse highlighted the tension and determination within the GOP as they work to secure House races and potentially expand their majority. The call for continued grassroots involvement and staying updated through reliable channels like NRCC.org underscores the importance of unity in this critical phase of the election process.
