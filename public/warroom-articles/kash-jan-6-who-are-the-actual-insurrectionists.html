<p>Joe Biden’s unhinged ramblings on Friday showed the Democrats’ January 6th narrative is crumbling, the deep state is on defense, and there is a massive corruption cover-up underway- all hiding behind their perversion of insurrection.</p>
<p><span>President Biden’s Department of Defense Inspector General Report for January 6 exonerates President Trump from any claims of insurrection- yes, you read that right. In his findings, Biden’s own IG found Trump’s Department of Defense "acted lawfully and appropriately,” per his direction. The </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q852-6nhDYyUZtoW6C6DXhGUJIzauad4/view?usp=sharing"><span>report</span></a><span> stated:</span></p>
<p><span>"[T]he actions the DoD took BEFORE January 6, 2021, to prepare for the planned protests in Washington, D.C., on January 5 and 6, 2021, were appropriate, supported by requirements, consistent with the DoD’s roles and responsibilities . . . and compliant with laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance”</span></p>
<p><span>§  "[T]he DoD’s actions to respond to the [United States Capitol Police Request for Assistance] ON January 6, 2021, were appropriate, supported by requirements, consistent with the DoD’s roles and responsibilities . . . and compliant with laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance”</span></p>
<p><span>§  DoD officials did NOT delay or obstruct the DoD’s response to the [United States Capitol Police Request for Assistance] on January 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>Per the Constitution and the chain of command, a Commander in Chief gives the orders to the Department of Defense. If President Trump gave the above order and authorized 10-20k National Guard days before Jan. 6 only to be denied by those in power, (as has been shown definitively by my own testimony, the Capitol Police Timeline capturing Nancy Pelosis’s refusal, Mayor Bowser’s own letter stating the same, and DoD’s own timeline) how can President Trump have committed insurrection?</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, the fake news mafia along with the FBI will never demand truthful answers that will destroy their disinformation campaign. After all, these are the same people that told you there were zero FBI informants present on Jan 6, only to recently </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/19/fbi-lost-count-of-number-of-informants-at-capitol-on-jan-6-ex-official/"><span>inform</span></a><span> Congress that there were actually so many, the FBI had to send out a formal nationwide poll to all its field offices and demand a head count. And yet, we still don’t know the exact number.</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, first it was "Trump never authorized the National Guard,” then it was "Pelosi/Bowser never blocked them,” now it’s multi-state ballot removal for "insurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span>That’s what we are left with – their next conspiracy to destroy this country because across from them sits their biggest nightmare, Donald J. Trump. Who else would destroy evidence presented to them under oath at Congress or the courts of law? </span></p>
<p><span>All of the above evidence and more, all of which was entered into evidence before the Jan. 6 Committee, only to be intentionally excluded from their final report, in violation of their written agreement (and similarly by the Colorado Judge and her baseless ‘insurrection’ ruling where I also testified). How can they be stewards of the law, when they intentionally precluded evidence of the truth?</span></p>
<p><span>The unfortunate reality is that the media is lying for them. The same ones who said "Trump is a Russian asset,” "Hunter is innocent,” and "51 intel officials never lied.” There’s no chance the FBI and the media are running another disinformation election rigging operation this time using Jan. 6 lies and insurrection chants, is there?</span></p>
<p><span>DoD officials (like myself and the Secretary of Defense) followed our lawful commands from President Trump for all matters pertaining to January 6. The question the media has consistently failed to ask because they know the answer will destroy their disinformation narrative – is why did those in positions of power refuse Trump’s assistance? Could it be because Pelosi was too busy filming a movie in the halls of Congress during the Jan. 6 ‘insurrection,’ or that Bowser’s desire to politically nuke Trump overrode her duty to protect the citizenry?</span></p>
<p><span>The media’s disgust with all things Trump, just like they have for the better part of a decade, requires they print fabrication. Riddle me this, which military did Trump hijack? What unlawful command did he issue to seize control of the government? And what votes did his actions preclude from being counted in Congress – the one that sent Joe Biden to the White House?</span></p>
<p><span>To date, not a single person has been charged with the crime of ‘insurrection.’</span></p>
<p><span>Special Counsel Jack Smith has not charged a single soul, including President Trump with this crime. But that did not stop a Colorado judge from shredding the Constitution and making a wholly baseless finding of ‘insurrection’ (which the Constitution forbids, but that’s for another day). Then, the judge went on to falsely ordain since the National Guard of D.C. did not possess sufficient numbers to provide the 10-20K authorized by Trump and he’d have to call others. It’s probably a good thing this black robed jackal has never been anywhere near serving in a role to defend this nation, since she so willingly lies to the world from the bench to advance a political narrative. She is the one who, like the Jan. 6 Committee, precluded all the same evidence cited above, so she could claim that her record was ‘devoid’ of evidence. If you intentionally choose to preclude evidence simply because it destroys the disinformation narrative you want to advance and light the Constitution on fire in the process, that makes you the constitutional arsonist.</span></p>
<p><span>The effects of these government gangsters and their conspirators in the media who have intentionally engineered a disinformation campaign surrounding Jan. 6 have cost this country decades of jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p><span>The same crew that got together and lied to you about Russia Gate, Hunter’s Laptop, 51 intel letter, and Hillary’s classified docs saga have teamed up to give you another election rigger. They never truly cared about the Constitution, only the unconstitutional defeat of Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span>Their game is the rote abuse of the law, a politicization of justice, and ultimate weaponization in their two-tier system of justice for one purpose – to conceal the truth and punish Trump.</span></p>
<p><span>The scary thing is, no one since Jan. 6 has done more harm to this country than these criminal sycophants peddling disinformation campaigns. They are the insurrection leviathans.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s one solution to fixing this mess and destroying the swamp once and for all:</span></p>
<p><span>Re-electing Donald Trump and unleashing a Deep State reckoning.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2024, the stakes have never been higher and we have one election to save America.</span></p>
