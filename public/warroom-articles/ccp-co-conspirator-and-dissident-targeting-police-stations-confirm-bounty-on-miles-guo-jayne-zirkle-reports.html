<p>Jayne Zirkle reporter for War Room joins Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro to discuss the latest in Chinese Communist Party infiltration in the US government. Two major cases are underway revealing the CCP agenda against dissidents living in the United States. The high-profile Pras Michel trial will soon be deliberated by a jury after hearing testimony from Former Attorney General Jeff Session, Leonardo DiCaprio, and other influential individuals. Michel was involved in a multi-million CCP lobbying scheme to have Miles Guo extradited. Unveiled on Monday was an elite dissident harassment campaign overseen by China’s Ministry of Public Security. Over 40 individuals have been charged in the matter.</p>
<p>"The thing that inextricably links the Pras Michel case and the bombshell release that happened on Monday is with these police stations in Chinatown is the effort to get Miles Guo and of course the Public Ministry of Security.”</p>
