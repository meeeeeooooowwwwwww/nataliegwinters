<p>Following revelations that Hunter Biden was paying his father, President Joe Biden, $49,910 in monthly rent to live at a Delaware residence where confidential documents were discovered, War Room can reveal the funds for the arrangement came from Rosemont Seneca Advisors LLC.</p>
<p>Two documents from the First Son’s hard drive reveal that the consulting firm, which was involved in Hunter Biden’s Chinese Communist Party-linked business ventures, was the source of funds for the astronomically high rent. Entities that comprised Hunter Biden’s income, according to the document, include LLCs tied to the Chinese Communist Party and its foreign influence operations.</p>
<p>Rosemont Seneca Advisors LLC was an offshoot of Rosemont Capital, an international private equity firm co-founded by Hunter Biden, the stepson of former Secretary of State and President Biden’s Climate Czar John <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/04/28/why-joe-biden-cant-fire-john-kerry/">Kerry</a>, and his Yale roommate in 2009. Other subsidiaries of the multi-billion-dollar <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/03/15/inside-the-shady-private-equity-firm-run-by-kerry-and-bidens-kids/">firm</a> included Rosemont Seneca Partners, Rosemont Seneca Technology <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/03/24/biden-linked-company-partnered-with-ukraine-biolabs/">Partners</a>, and even Rosemont Realty.</p>
<p>Rosemont Seneca Partners <a href="https://www.bhrpe.com/show.php?catid=42&amp;id=133">infamously</a> joined the BHR Partners investment fund, a $1.5 billion deal birthed less than two weeks after Hunter Biden accompanied his father on a trip to China. The venture was <a href="https://www.bhrpe.com/list.php?catid=8&amp;page=1">underwritten and controlled</a> by Chinese Communist Party-run banks and officials.</p>
<p>The Rosemont Seneca name appears to be the entity through which Hunter Biden conduct a majority of his Chinese Communist Party-linked business dealings.</p>
<p>The freshly obtained documents link Rosemont Seneca Advisors to the already suspicious rent payment scheme between Hunter Biden and his father, which many have alleged could have been an avenue whereby the former veep received his “10 percent for the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/27/hunter-bidens-biz-partner-called-joe-biden-the-big-guy-in-panic-over-laptop/">big</a> guy.”</p>
<p>A PDF document titled “RSA Rev Exp June-Dec 2017 Profit and Loss” lists $215,967.62 in income and $310246.25 in expenses. Among the expenses listed on the document is $49,910 in rent, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11641065/Hunter-Biden-helped-pay-upkeep-Joes-home-classified-documents-found.html">which</a> is the same figure Hunter Biden listed on a background check first revealed by journalist Miranda Devine.</p>

<p>A separate document from the same timeframe provides more insight into what constituted Hunter Biden’s source of income.</p>

<p>Two payments totaling $22,500 from Harves Group LLC also comprised Hunter Biden’s income. Harves Group is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-zhang-8b7307a2/">company</a> led by Bo Zhang with deep connections to the Chinese Communist Party, as previous reports from Hunter Biden’s hard drive have revealed.</p>
<p>The President’s son was invited to secretly visit Zhang and his family, which included Chinese Communist Party officials, in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-plan-probe-hunter-bidens-chinese-business-deals-accountability-coming">China</a> to potentially work together. Zhang, however, has even deeper ties to Beijing, as a 2013 Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/2165-Exhibit-AB-20131223-50.pdf">filing with the Justice Department</a> listed Zhang as a “foreign principal.”</p>
<p>The filing documented his relationship with Chinese Communist Party official Liu Guoqiang, who was the vice chairman of the Liaoning Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which runs China's “United Front” effort.</p>
<p>The “United Front” <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-overseas-united-front-work-background-and-implications-united-states">seeks</a> "to co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party." The U.S. State Department has also <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/designation-of-the-national-association-for-chinas-peaceful-unification-nacpu-as-a-foreign-mission-of-the-prc/index.html">compared </a>the effort to the Chinese regime's "magic weapon" to advance its preferred policies by infiltrating American politics, media, and academia.</p>
<p>$56,603.74 was listed as income from Robsinson Walker LLC. The eponymous LLC had received multi-million-dollar wire transfers from Shanghai-based State Energy HK Ltd. in February and March 2017, though a report from the Senate's Finance Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,  which flagged the transactions, noted that it's "unclear what the true purpose is behind these transactions and who the ultimate beneficiary is.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/19/hunter-biden-associate-got-6m-from-chinese-firm-senate-republicans/">government</a> report, however, calls the cash transfers "a direct link between Walker and the communist Chinese government and, because of his close association with Hunter Biden, yet another tie between Hunter Biden's financial arrangements and the communist Chinese government."</p>
<p>At the time the money was sent, State Energy HK "was affiliated with CEFC China Energy, which was under the leadership of Ye Jianming," who reportedly had ties to China's military and intelligence before he was taken into custody and disappeared in early 2018.</p>
<p>Three payments from an individual named Yuxiang Jiang were also included.</p>
