<p>In a recent impassioned address to the War Room audience, Kash Patel highlighted the show’s overall appeal to it’s diverse audience known as the “posse”, attributing the growing and stable viewer interest to its complex coverage of the multiple diverse issues impacting everyday Americans. Patel talked about the scope of discussions on the WarRoom, stating, “I think the reason the War Room Posse and people subscribe to this show day in and day out, is because of the level of details you get about everyday issues from things like natural disasters to Congress to presidential elections to the southern border to the never-ending Wars, to the CCP, to Russia to hostage rescue operations and to taking on the Norco traffickers and so much more.”</p>
<p>GARLAND WAS A FOCUS</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Patel zoned in on the injustice in the US House, saying, “Merrick Garland is creating an alternate universe of justice, an alternate system of exoneration, where he claims executive privilege for Biden but would throw any of us in prison for defying Congress. That’s why this election is about the United States Constitution, ensuring one system of laws for every American.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In Thursday’s program, Patel made a direct and urgent call to action, urging listeners to engage with their representatives on critical issues like the contempt of Congress vote that happened in the House earlier on Thursday when Four Republicans voted along with Democrats to give Merrick Garland a pass for the same thing that Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon are imprisoned for.</p>
<p>He emphasized, “I’m going to ask the War Room Posse to start calling Congress right now and start emailing your representatives.” Patel then highlighted specific congressional actions that had drawn his ire. He pinpointed four Republican representatives who had crossed party lines on a crucial vote concerning Merrick Garland: “Duarte, Joyce, McClintock, and Turner.”</p>

<p><strong><span> Mike Turner (Ohio). </span></strong></p>

<p>Patel’s critique centered on what he saw as a glaring double standard in justice, particularly regarding Merrick Garland’s handling of congressional subpoenas. He criticized Republican leadership’s failure to initially hold Garland accountable and proposed a solution he termed “inherent contempt of Congress.” Reflecting on Garland’s actions, Patel asserted, “Merrick Garland still broke the law, and Congress needs to be able to rein him in.”</p>
<p>Drawing on his experience with the RussiaGate investigation, Patel stressed the necessity of inherent contempt as a tool to ensure accountability: “Congress can go out there and say to anyone that has violated their Congressional subpoenas, like Merrick Garland in this instance, and get the sergeant-at-arms to go out and arrest Merrick Garland.”</p>
<p>Patel’s remarks underscored his belief in the equal application of the law and his frustration with what he perceived as a selective enforcement of justice based on political affiliations. He argued passionately, “We cannot have the top law enforcement officer in our country able to create an alternate Universe of Justice, able to create an alternate system of exoneration.” Patel criticized what he viewed as hypocrisy in the application of executive privilege, contrasting it with the potential consequences for ordinary citizens: “How would it fare if Congress subpoenaed you and said, ‘we want all these documents and if you don’t show up, we’re going to throw you in prison’?”</p>
<p>Throughout his address, Patel remained steadfast in his defense of constitutional principles, declaring, “To me, that’s what this coming election is about more than anything, the United States Constitution.” He rejected the notion of a revenge-driven agenda, instead advocating for adherence to the Constitution as the ultimate arbiter of justice and fairness: “We have the greatest document in U.S. history, it’s called the United States Constitution. That is our retribution.”</p>
<p>Patel’s remarks in the War Room encapsulated his deep-seated concerns about the integrity of the legal system and the need for government accountability. His call for action resonated with the audience, reflecting a broader frustration with perceived political maneuvering at the expense of constitutional principles. Patel’s words served to galvanize and educate, urging Americans to engage actively in upholding the foundations of their democracy.</p>
