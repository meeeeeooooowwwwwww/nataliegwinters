<p>The federal government is hiding the names of non-profit groups receiving nine and eight-figure grants from the Biden administration during the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
<p>ForeignAssistance.gov, the federal <a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/about">government’s</a> flagship website tracking its foreign spending, itemized the nearly $3.2 billion that has been allocated to Ukraine for “economic development” and “humanitarian assistance” for fiscal year 2022. The grants come from a variety of agencies<span> including the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of State, and the Department of Energy.</span></p>
<p>32 grants totaling nearly $300 million dollars, however, have identified their n<span>on-governmental organization (NGO) </span><span>implementing partner as either “</span><span>NGO – United States Redacted”; “</span><span>NGO – Non United States Redacted”; or “</span><span>NGO – International Redacted.”</span></p>
<p>For example, four grants totaling $100,000,000, $57,000,000, $43,000,000, and $10,000,000 to support “emergency humanitarian assistance” were allocated to unidentified NGOs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A $7,900,000 grant sent to an unidentified NGO even saw its purpose redacted, pursuant to the “<span>Exceptions Outlined in the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016.”</span></p>
<p>The only detail about the grant is that it aims to “support the Mission’s goal for an independent, prosperous, and healthy Ukraine united around core European values in one or more of the following sectors: strengthening of democratic governance, and more inclusive, sustainable, market-driven economic growth.”</p>
