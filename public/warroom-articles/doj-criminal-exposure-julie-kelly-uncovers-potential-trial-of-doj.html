<p>In a recent podcast, investigative journalist Julie Kelly, who has been leading the WarRoom in discussing the various lawfare moves against President Donald J. Trump, discussed the potential criminal exposure of Special Counsel Jack Smith and the Department of Justice in a Florida court.  The case is presided over by Judge Aileen Cannon and involves charges of alleged improper use of classified documents.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So at least the southern Florida proceedings are going to be delayed until the New York trial is over. Now, there’s a good chance that the Southern Florida trial will be held before the election, and I get a sense from Judge Cannon that she really wants the DOJ to have to go on trial in Southern Florida,” Kelly said.</p></blockquote>
<p>She added: “We’re not New York. We’re not Manhattan. We’re not in Washington, DC; we’re in Southern Florida, which is a good mix.  I think there’s a big part of her that wants  Jack Smith to put this case before a jury and just have the defense team eviscerate him and prove to the people what a manufactured case this was from the very beginning. So there is a chance that could still be pulled off,” Kelly told her co-host.</p>
<p>[Listen: Go 48:00 mark for remarks about Cannon]</p>
<p>Kelly has been delving into newly unredacted documents authorized by Judge Cannon and reporting for the WarRoom. Meanwhile, the WarRoom audience urges the US House to open a Criminal Conspiracy inquiry.</p>
<p>Amid this activity, a mysterious 300-page report emerged from US Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. This report further indicated a Criminal Conspiracy against Trump, yet it received little attention.</p>
<p>And no one in DC has admitted to putting the work of Kelly and the government report together.</p>
<p>Jordan’s lack of urgency has led to public demands for action from the Republican-led US House, specifically Speaker Mike Johnson.</p>
<p>Steve Bannon, host of the WarRoom, has been rallying his audience to pressure the slow-moving Republicans in DC to act on the information we know that they have.</p>
<p>Bannon reiterated these calls on Saturday, advocating for a motion to vacate Speaker Johnson due to his reluctance to support Kelly’s investigations, to move on the Committee report, and over the broader issues of protecting Trump and upholding law and order.</p>
<p>See this clip from the Saturday WarRoom:</p>
<p>One key aspect Kelly repeatedly highlights is the DOJ’s involvement in concealing information from the public regarding the Biden administration’s actions starting in 2021.</p>
<p>By exposing these discrepancies, Kelly has raised questions about the integrity of the DOJ’s handling of the case and its collaboration with other government agencies, which is something that Johnson and the US House should be doing.</p>
<p>Bannon demands answers as to why Johnson is not moving.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kelly has revealed instances of alleged prosecutorial abuse, including threats made by lead prosecutor Jay Bratt to coerce cooperation from individuals involved in the case. These revelations underscore the urgent need for transparency and accountability within the DOJ.</p>
<p>See a recent post she made:</p>
<p>Kelly’s investigative efforts have garnered attention from at least one US Rep, who contacted Kelly late last week as she <a href="https://warroom.org/house-members-inquiry-to-julie-kelly-signals-potential-shift-in-trumps-legal-battle/">reported to the WarRoom. </a></p>
<p>As we reported <a href="https://warroom.org/speaker-johnson-wont-budge-on-jordans-criminal-conspiracy-judiciary-report/">Friday</a>, Johnson appears to be the one who refuses to elevate the Committee’s report or Kelly’s highlighted points.</p>
<p>Bannon commented on Saturday about Kelly’s work, praising her and slamming the lack of action and vocal support from elected officials for what she has uncovered.</p>
<p>Bannon questioned why the Republican House does not have a larger team dedicated to similar efforts as Kelly’s and demanded answers regarding elected officials’ stance on the issue.</p>
<p>[8:00 Mark for Bannon’s comments about Kelly]</p>
<h1>Steve Bannon: The Controlled-Opposition GOP Are In A “Fetal Position” On The National Stage</h1>
<p>The grassroots organizing efforts of the WarRoom have undoubtedly proven instrumental in bringing attention to overlooked aspects of ongoing legal battles involving Trump.</p>
<p>As the spotlight intensifies on the DOJ’s actions in the Florida case before Judge Cannon, the public remains eager for answers and accountability.</p>
<p>Bannon’s calls to action, the WarRoom’s organized activism, and Kelly’s relentless pursuit of truth are beacons of hope for those seeking justice and transparency in the face of government overreach and abuse of power.</p>
