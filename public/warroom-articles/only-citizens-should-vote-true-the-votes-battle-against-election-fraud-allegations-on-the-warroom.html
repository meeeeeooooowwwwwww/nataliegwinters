<p>On Wednesday, Congressman Chip Roy spoke with Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote, to address the wave of criticism aimed at her organization, particularly from major media outlets like CNN. True the Vote is being accused of voter suppression tactics, but Engelbrecht insists that the group’s mission is to protect election integrity by ensuring only eligible citizens vote.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>She explains, “True the Vote is dedicated to protecting the integrity of our elections and ensuring that only eligible citizens can vote.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As she discussed with Roy after viewing a CNN hit piece in the show’s cold open footage, Engelbrecht is under fire for True the Vote’s initiatives, which aim to empower citizens to evaluate local voter rolls and identify potentially ineligible voter registrations. Critics have characterized these initiatives as attempts to suppress voters, a claim she firmly denies.</p>
<p>“This is just the attack du jour,” Engelbrecht remarked, referring to the latest CNN report. She described how CNN is conducting open records requests to obtain the names of volunteers involved in True the Vote’s efforts, which is allegedly leading to harassment. “CNN has taken it upon itself to file open records requests for everywhere they think citizens… will be involved.</p>
<p>They’re filing those open records requests with the counties, getting the names of the people involved, and then harassing them, showing up on their doorstep. It’s outrageous,” she stated.</p>
<p>The discussion highlighted True the Vote’s focus on projects like the <a href="https://www.iv3.us/">IV3</a> initiative, which aims to clean up voter rolls by identifying potentially fraudulent or ineligible registrations. Engelbrecht claims the project has successfully flagged over 825,000 potentially ineligible records. These are often people who have moved, registered in multiple states, or are registered at commercial addresses rather than residential ones.</p>
<p>“Our voter rolls are a mess,” Engelbrecht insisted, emphasizing the need for accurate and reliable voter data.</p>
<p>Roy, who sympathizes with Engelbrecht’s challenges, pointed out the broader political climate’s hostility toward election integrity efforts. “I get it in Congress all the time… We understand what the radical progressive Democratic machine is doing,” he noted, reflecting on the broader discourse surrounding election fraud and integrity.</p>
<p>He pointed to jurisdictions like Washington, D.C., where non-citizens have been reportedly encouraged to register for local elections, describing this as part of a broader strategy to undermine U.S. election systems. “We literally had a program in DC, and we had a vote to stop that in the House. And it passed with significant Democrat support, by the way,” Roy added, stressing bipartisan recognition of the issue.</p>
<p>Engelbrecht further defended True the Vote’s use of the IV3 app, designed to aid citizens in evaluating voter registrations within their communities. “In Texas, you have to find personal belief of the facts that are available that support the submission of a challenge,” she explained. The process involves citizens presenting potentially ineligible voter records to county officials, who then determine their validity. Engelbrecht argued that CNN’s portrayal overlooks the role counties play in verifying these challenges, focusing instead on True the Vote’s involvement. “It is ultimately the county that is making the determinations,” she clarified.</p>
<p>In response to CNN’s allegations, Engelbrecht challenged the idea that her organization aims to disenfranchise voters. Instead, she portrayed True the Vote as a necessary force in a landscape of outdated and inaccurate voter rolls. “We live in the age of Amazon. One click, where our data is known to the nth degree, how could it be that our voter rolls, which should be the bedrock of a representative republic, how could it be that they are so inaccurate?” she asked, highlighting the need for technological advancements in voter registration systems.</p>
<p>Engelbrecht concluded the conversation by urging citizens to get involved and stay informed about their local voter rolls. She believes that empowering citizens to act is crucial for maintaining a fair and transparent electoral process.</p>
<p>“Don’t just listen to what I’m telling you, look at it for yourselves and judge for yourselves if the problems you’re facing in the county are things that you want to bring to the attention of your elected representatives,” she advised. For Engelbrecht and True the Vote, the mission is clear: safeguarding the integrity of American elections is a responsibility that falls on every citizen.</p>
