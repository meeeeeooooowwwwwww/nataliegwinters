<p>Taylor emphasized on the WarRoom that the film “covers a very large space of time,” examining the actions of key figures within the political landscape. He points out that the story is not just about recent years or the Trump administration but highlights the long-standing issues within the government. According to Taylor, the film “applies not just during the Trump years. But it goes back, then it goes forward because you know, these people will still be around if we don’t hold them accountable.”</p>
<p>One of the most alarming aspects of the film, according to Taylor, is the extent of the intelligence community’s involvement in unethical activities. He reveals that “the intelligence apparatus…did the work on behalf of the Clinton campaign.” Taylor explains that it is “very uncommon if not at all for the CIA or the NSA to do these kinds of things,” and expresses his concern over their unchecked power.</p>
<p>The film initially included evidence that “the NSA allowed the wiretapping of the White House,” but due to time constraints, this information was cut. Taylor describes a chilling scenario where “you had a lot of wiretapping of government officials from other government officials from the deep state.” This illustrates how the intelligence community, with its “unlimited power, unlimited reach, and unlimited money,” can target anyone they dislike.</p>
<p>He warns, “These are very dangerous people. These are very dangerous organizations,” who can “wiretap you, arrest you, and get rid of you” if they see fit. This level of corruption within the government raises significant concerns about privacy, accountability, and the future of democracy.</p>
<p>Despite these unsettling discoveries, Taylor insists that his film is ultimately a story of hope and resilience. He believes it demonstrates that the perpetrators of such corruption can be defeated. “This is actually a positive film,” Taylor states, adding, “it shows that they got caught” and were stopped by individuals like Kash Patel, who played a crucial role in exposing the truth.</p>
<p>Taylor’s film serves as a wake-up call to citizens and policymakers alike, urging them to hold those in power accountable and work towards a more transparent and just government. He said he hopes audiences will walk away with a renewed sense of empowerment, knowing that systemic corruption can be challenged and defeated.</p>
<p>The WarRoom film, is available at warroom.film, and provides an insightful look into government corruption, encouraging viewers to stay vigilant and informed.</p>
