<p>In today’s increasingly interconnected world, Investigative journalist Lara Logan has exposed a shadowy network of radical organizations and groups that has emerged, wielding immense power and influence without the accountability expected in democratic societies.</p>
<p>Logan reported on Thursday’s WarRoom that these entities operate under the guise of progressive political ideals and charitable missions but harbor a sinister agenda to dominate humanity.</p>
<p>As journalist Logan pointed out to WarRoom host Dave Brat, these groups form “a global cult” that manipulates political and social dynamics to further their interests.</p>
<p>Logan described for Brat that the backbone of this shadow government is a network of Affinity groups, loosely connected organizations that share common ideologies and goals. She reported that these groups ranged from Marxist collectives to environmental and animal rights organizations. They function like a spider’s web, extending their reach into various sectors of society, often under the protection of legal bodies like the National Lawyers Guild.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Logan noted, “Anytime you see this kind of language, you know, mutual aid is a Marxist dog whistle,” indicating how seemingly innocuous terms conceal deeper agendas.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>These affinity groups are ideologically driven and financially and strategically supported by influential non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and foundations. Organizations like the Open Society Foundation, the Kellogg Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Tides Foundation are often the financial lifelines for these groups, enabling them to pursue their objectives without facing significant opposition or scrutiny.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Logan explained, “They’re financed by non-governmental organizations. This is how they set up a money laundering operation,” highlighting the opaque financial practices that allow these groups to thrive.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>What makes this shadow government particularly alarming is its global reach. These organizations have offices and operations worldwide, creating a unified front that can influence international policy and societal norms. “These issues are now completely global,” Logan remarked, pointing to the seamless spread of ideologies across borders. Technology and social media play a crucial role in this expansion, allowing for the rapid dissemination of ideas and coordination of activities on a global scale.</p>
<p>Logan told Brat to imagine if historical figures like Hitler or Marx had access to today’s technology, which Logan ominously highlighted: “If they had had access to billions of people all over the planet for their message, that would have been absolutely devastating.”</p>
<p>The reality of such technological power is no longer hypothetical; it’s being wielded by these modern-day organizations, shaping narratives and public opinion worldwide.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is the lack of accountability. These organizations operate with little to no oversight, effectively bypassing the democratic processes that govern the lives of ordinary citizens. Logan noted, “It’s as fascist as it gets to the core,” referring to the unchecked power and influence these groups wield. This lack of accountability is compounded by the financial backing they receive, which insulates them from public scrutiny and allows them to push their agendas with impunity.</p>
<p>She said the recent revelations about Black Lives Matter and its international operations further illustrate the point. What began as a domestic movement has now transformed into a global entity, funded and supported by some of the world’s most powerful foundations. “The Tides Foundation was at one point running their International operation,” Logan revealed, underscoring the complex web of support enabling these organizations to operate globally.</p>
<p>The rise of this secret hand, shadow world government poses a significant threat to democratic societies and the principles of accountability and transparency. As these organizations continue to grow in influence, it becomes imperative for citizens and policymakers alike to demand greater oversight and transparency. The consolidation of power and resources in the hands of a few not only undermines democratic processes but also endangers the very fabric of society.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the existence of a shadow world government comprised of unaccountable organizations and affinity groups is not a mere conspiracy theory but a pressing reality that demands immediate attention.</p>
<p>As Logan succinctly put it, “This Marxist thing is an attack… a denial of God.” The time has come to unmask these entities and hold them accountable for their actions, ensuring that power remains in the hands of the people and not a select few who operate in the shadows.</p>
