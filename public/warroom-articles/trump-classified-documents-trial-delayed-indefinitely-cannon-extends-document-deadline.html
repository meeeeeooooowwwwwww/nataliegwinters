<p>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, recently extended a key deadline in President Donald Trump’s criminal trial for allegedly mishandling White House documents. This indefinitely paused a requirement that Trump disclose what classified materials his legal team plans to introduce at trial.</p>
<p>This decision marks the latest in a series of delays by Judge Cannon, which resulted in the trial being postponed without a new date being determined.</p>
<p>Trump’s legal team has argued that Special Counsel Jack Smith and government prosecutors mishandled evidence by moving documents out of order within the boxes seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has not responded to a request for comment on the latest delay, and it is currently unclear when Judge Cannon will set new deadlines for the classified documents disclosures or when the trial will start.</p>
<blockquote><p>“According to a Tuesday Forbes report, Cannon issued a brief <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67490070/united-states-v-trump/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc">order</a> Monday night pausing a deadline—originally set for Thursday—that requires Trump to disclose what classified materials his legal team plans to introduce at trial.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>That filing is important because it tees up a potential legal battle over what classified materials can be used at trial, former prosecutor Joyce Vance <a href="https://joycevance.substack.com/p/the-week-ahead-922?r=5n3e&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">noted</a>, which The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/us/politics/trump-classified-documents-trial-delay.html">points out</a> could take months in itself to resolve before the case can go to trial.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not the only problem for Trump’s opponents.</p>

<p>In Julie Kelly’s most recent report, titled “<a href="https://www.declassified.live/p/the-dojs-doctored-crime-scene-photo">The DOJ’s Doctored Crime Scene Photo of Mar-a-Lago Raid” from the “Declassified with Julie Kelly</a>,” Kelly reported:</p>
<p>“DOJ and the media have lied about the infamous photo of alleged classified documents seized during FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago. New court filings prove the FBI used cover sheets depicted in the photo during the raid.”</p>
<p>Kelly, a constant WarRoom source of information on J6 trials and the numerous lawfare cases against President Trump, was focused for this report on new disclosures in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s espionage case against Donald Trump. The disclosures reveal that the FBI tampered with evidence to create a controversial photo and that the DOJ has allegedly lied about it for nearly two years.</p>
<p>The article highlights several key points:</p>
<p>1)The controversial photo was taken after the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. It shows classified documents with colored cover sheets.</p>
<p>2) The DOJ’s use of the photo was misleading, as the cover sheets were not “recovered” in the container but were instead used as placeholders by the FBI.</p>
<p>3) The FBI agents’ handling of the documents raises questions about their security clearance, the documents’ classification status, and the accuracy of the placeholders.</p>
<p>4) There are discrepancies between the placeholders and the documents, and the physical boxes’ contents do not match the FBI’s accounting.</p>
<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith might have significant problems due to these revelations.</p>
