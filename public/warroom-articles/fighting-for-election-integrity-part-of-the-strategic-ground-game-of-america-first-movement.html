<p>In a Saturday discussion on the WarRoom program, Bruce L. Castor Jr. and Marly Hornik joined Steve Bannon to address pressing concerns about the integrity of recent election results in Pennsylvania and beyond. Their conversation into the critical legal filings aimed at safeguarding election accuracy highlighted election integrity tactics and grassroots organizing as pivotal strategies for the America First movement.</p>
<p>Castor, known for being one of President Trump’s impeachment lawyers, opened the discussion by raising alarms about the reliability of election processes in Pennsylvania.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s not necessarily voter fraud,” Castor clarified, “but rather a failure to meet the minimal touchstones required by Congress to ensure election reliability.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Castor emphasized filing federal court actions over state and federal Civil Rights violations to address these concerns, fearing similar issues could compromise future elections without intervention.</p>
<p>Bannon expressed skepticism about the reliability and complexity of ballot tabulation machines used in elections, while acknowledging he liked to stay focused on other election concerns as well- in a multipronged strategy for winning the 2024 eletion.</p>
<p>Bannon, who has acknowledged the importance of the election machine activists, remarked, “I’m not a machine guy. I think the machines are overcomplicated. It should be like counting cash in Vegas and it’s not. It’s way too sophisticated.”</p>
<p>Bannon’s concerns about the transparency and accuracy of election technology are likely shared by the majority within the America First movement. They advocate for simpler, more transparent voting systems to ensure accountability and trust in election outcomes.</p>

<p>Bannon’s concerns about the transparency and accuracy of election technology are likely shared by the majority within the America First movement. They advocate for simpler, more transparent voting systems to ensure accountability and trust in election outcomes.</p>
<p>The conversation pivoted to specific instances of concern, citing discrepancies in ballot tabulation machines and the certification processes overseen by election officials. Castor highlighted a troubling finding: “In one area alone, there were 9,100 more votes counted than there were ballots cast.” This revelation underscored systemic errors in the election process, casting doubt on the accuracy and integrity of the results certified by state and local officials.</p>
<p>Hornik, founder of <a href="https://unite4freedom.com/">United Sovereign Americans</a>, echoed these concerns, detailing her organization’s efforts to audit voter registration anomalies in New York. “We might have uncovered over 5 million felonies in the New York state voter registration list,” Hornik asserted, pointing to significant irregularities that persisted into the 2022 midterm elections.</p>
<p>Both Castor and Hornik emphasized the big picture of these findings beyond partisan outcomes, framing the issue as a fundamental civil rights battle. “This is not about election outcomes or candidates,” Hornik emphasized, “but a massive constitutional fight for civil rights and equal protection under the law.”</p>
<p>Their discussion exposed the strategic approach of the America First movement, intertwining legal challenges with grassroots activism to Get Out The Vote, with Trump-endorsed initiatives like <a href="https://trumpforce47.com/?trk=public_post-text">Trump Force 47</a> and <a href="https://swampthevoteusa.com/">Swamp the Vote</a>.</p>
<p>Castor argued for federal intervention to enforce election standards set by Congress, urging federal judges to acknowledge and rectify systemic flaws in election administration. “We need a national conversation on fixing these issues,” Castor insisted, foreseeing a potential firestorm if these concerns were left unaddressed.</p>
<p>The grassroots efforts led by Hornik’s organization, coupled with Castor’s legal expertise, exemplify a concerted effort within the America First movement to restore confidence in electoral processes. By challenging the status quo and highlighting discrepancies undermining voter trust, they aim to ensure that future elections meet the rigorous standards necessary for a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>Castor, Hornik, and Bannon underscore a multifaceted approach to safeguarding election integrity, which is an essential part of the strategy for winning elections. Their combined efforts illustrate how legal challenges and grassroots activism intersect to uphold constitutional principles and restore public trust in America’s electoral system.</p>
