<span>"Climate elitists are never </span><span>more happy</span><span> than when they’re destroying energy jobs and making it impossible for working families to get by, so it’s no surprise they’re celebrating,” he told The Center Square. “What advocates laughably call ‘clean energy’ is failing on a massive scale and often leaving taxpayers and ratepayers to </span><span>holding</span><span> the bag. Shutting down reliable power that has worked for decades to replace it with inferior Chinese-made energy products is a tragedy, not cause for celebration.””</span></div>
