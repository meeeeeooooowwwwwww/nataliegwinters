<p>In a powerful opinion article in <i>The Telegraph </i>(UK), <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2023/11/28/politicians-have-created-a-multicultural-monster/">Allison Pearson</a> reveals how the Irish government is destroying Irish society through the importation of immigrants.She notes how mothers and grandmothers in Dublin are working together to protect their daughters and granddaughters from the immigrants.Labeled a problem by the Irish government, the women know that they are not the problem, the disastrous policies of the Irish government are.</p>
<p>Pearson writes:</p>
<p>"This is such a vast, epochal mistake, the consequences so volatile and hard to control, that governments are now running scared and cannot own up to their mistake. Instead, the people must be blamed for their ‘hateful’ reaction to the mistake.”</p>
<p>While Irish civil society, groups like these volunteer women, labors to address some of the problems the Irish government created, that government refuses to address, preferring to blame the Irish people and terming those opposed as "far-Right” to delegitimize them.</p>
<p>Pearson notes: </p>
<p>"What struck me about those women in their 40s, 50s and 60s – women with daughters and granddaughters to worry about – was that a major part of their anger arose from the fact that, not only were they not being heard, they were being treated as the problem. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2023/11/21/rishi-sunak-economy-immigration-housing-security-healthcare/">They weren’t the problem, and they knew they weren’t</a>.</p>
<p>The problem was that their government was allowing men from God-knows-where into their community. Mainly young men who would want sex (how rarely that basic fact is mentioned) and who came from countries where girls with their heads uncovered, their flesh exposed, are viewed by some as fair game.</p>
<p>It was perfectly clear to the Irish women that the safety of their children should come first, above any other consideration. In any previous generation, it would have. But Western governments like theirs are so wedded to a multicultural experiment that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/02/the-west-must-find-the-moral-courage-to-say-no-to-refugees/">they have failed</a> to prevent a large number of illegal migrants (and far too many legal immigrants in the UK’s case) into their countries, often without adequate checks.”</p>
<p>The horrific attacks of last week were the latest of a series of attacks, including the murder of a teacher, Ashling Murphy, by a Slovak Romany migrant.Last year, an Iranian migrant murdered two gay Irish men, decapitating one of them. </p>
<p>In a victim-impact statement, Ashling Murphy’s boyfriend, Ryan Casey, pleaded:</p>
<p>"How can someone come to this country, get social housing, social welfare, not hold down a job of any description and never contribute to society for 10 years? This is not the country that Ashling and I grew up in and once loved. It has officially lost its innocence. This country needs to wake up. This time things have got to change. This country is simply not safe anymore. I’m afraid our country is heading down a very dangerous path.”</p>
<p>According to polls, 75 percent of the Irish people believe that the number of refugees entering Ireland is too many.</p>
<p>So far, and in a common theme for Western societies, the government identifies its population as the problem.</p>
<p>Pearson insightfully argues that the Irish and British people</p>
<p>"are being gaslit on a grand scale. Undocumented males from the war-torn Middle East and North Africa arriving in our neighbourhoods [<i>sic</i>]are not the problem, they say smoothly. It’s prejudiced people like us, who don’t want young foreign men with no concept of Western values around our daughters and granddaughters, that are the problem.”</p>
<p>This opinion article should be widely read and distributed.The poignant appeal of a Dublin mother is a fitting close:</p>
<p>"’When we do things peacefully we get ignored,’ one mother said after the Dublin riots that an Irish government, which has recklessly endangered its own citizens, tried to blame on far-Right thugs. Here’s the thing: all of us are ‘far-Right’ when our loved ones are at risk of being stabbed by someone who shouldn’t be in our country.”</p>
<p>This powerful article captures well the plight of Western societies in the age of betrayal by their governments.After the June 1953 riots in East German by those protesting the tyranny of the Communist government, playwright Bertolt Brecht wondered—given that the East German government stated that the people had forfeited the confidence of the government—if it would not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another. </p>
<p>In her exceptional opinion article, Pearson captures, as Brecht did, the nature of a government that will not heed its citizens.Indeed, labors to delegitimize their just concerns and suppress political expression.This is the nature of tyrannical government in 1953 or 2023.</p>
