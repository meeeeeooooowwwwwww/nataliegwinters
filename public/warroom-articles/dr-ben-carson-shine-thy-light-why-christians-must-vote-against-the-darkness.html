<p>Dr. Ben Carson issued a powerful call to Christians from the WarRoom on Tuesday, urging them to shine their light on the current political darkness and fulfill their duty by voting against forces undermining moral values and freedom. Carson’s message was clear: Christians cannot afford to remain passive or indifferent in this pivotal moment for our nation.</p>
<p>Carson began by reflecting on the foundational principles set forth by the Founding Fathers, particularly John Adams, who famously said that the U.S. Constitution was “designed for moral and religious people” and was inadequate for any other.</p>
<p>This principle underscores Carson’s argument that the moral fabric of the country is at risk if Christians fail to engage in the political process. “We seem to have a leadership now that is inconsistent with Christian morality,” Carson observed, highlighting issues like abortion and transgender rights as areas where current policies conflict with Christian values.</p>
<p>The core of Carson’s argument revolves around the need for Christians to act decisively in the face of moral and ideological threats. He criticized the tendency among some Evangelicals to abstain from voting out of dissatisfaction with certain candidates, likening this to preferring a surgeon with poor bedside manner who saves lives over one with a pleasant demeanor who fails. Carson’s analogy emphasizes the importance of prioritizing effectiveness and moral alignment over personal preferences. “At some point, you have to use that tremendous brain God gave you,” he urged, recognizing the need to make pragmatic choices that align with Christian principles.</p>
<p>Carson also addressed concerns from non-religious individuals about the frequent focus on religion in political discussions. He countered by framing the debate as one of fundamental logic and freedom rather than solely religious doctrine. “Does it make sense to be able to express yourself the way you want to? Does it make sense to have a traditional nuclear family and pass on values to your children?” Carson asked, stressing that these values are under threat from Marxist ideologies that seek to replace traditional family structures with state control. He cited the 1963 Congressional Record’s list of communist goals, which included driving wedges between children and their parents—a strategy to ensure long-term ideological control.</p>
<p>The heart of Carson’s message is a call to action. He emphasized that Christians must not only be aware of these threats but actively counteract them. “We need to get up and become active,” he said, advocating for increased voter engagement and public discourse. Carson implored Christians to break the traditional taboo against discussing politics and religion in public, advocating for transparency and awareness to combat the left’s agenda. “Shine the light,” he declared, underscoring the need to expose and challenge the darkness of ideological subversion.</p>
<p>Dr. Carson’s message to Christians is a challenge and a call to responsibility. By voting and engaging in public discourse, Christians can help preserve the nation’s moral foundation and ensure that the values they cherish continue to guide the country. The time for passive observation is over; it is now a moment for action. As Carson poignantly stated, failing to act is not just an oversight but a dereliction of duty to uphold the principles of freedom and moral integrity.</p>
