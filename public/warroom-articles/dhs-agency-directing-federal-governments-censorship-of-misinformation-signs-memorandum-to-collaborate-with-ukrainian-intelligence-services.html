<p>A branch of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security spearheading the federal government’s social media censorship efforts â€" including posts about “the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine” â€" signed a memorandum of cooperation with Ukraine’s intelligence services to broaden its joint “cybersecurity” efforts.</p>
<p>The unearthed agreement between the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), an operational component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and its Ukrainian counterpart follows significant controversy over the agency’s covert censorship of Americans on a wide variety of topics.</p>
<p>Internal <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/">documents</a> have shown CISA works to combat “misinformation” about topics including "the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.” The agency also played a critical role in the <a href="https://www.trendsmap.com/twitter/tweet/1601352083617505281">"removal of President Trump,"</a> per internal communications released from Twitter.</p>
<p>The final item in the aforementioned list â€" “the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine” â€" is of particular concern and interest in light of War Room revealing the agency’s partnership with the country.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Ukrainian State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) this week to strengthen collaboration on shared cybersecurity priorities,” explained a press <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2022/07/27/united-states-and-ukraine-expand-cooperation-cybersecurity">release</a> from July 27th, 2022.</p>
<p>The agency noted that the new MOC “expands upon CISA's existing relationship with the Government of Ukraine” and will include “information exchanges and sharing of best practices on cyber incidents; critical infrastructure security technical exchanges; and cybersecurity training and joint exercises.”</p>
<p>"I am incredibly pleased to sign this MOC to deepen our cybersecurity collaboration with our Ukrainian partners," said CISA Director Jen Easterly.</p>
<p>"I applaud Ukraine's heroic efforts to defend its nation against unprecedented Russian cyber aggression and have been incredibly moved by the resiliency and bravery of the Ukrainian people throughout this unprovoked war. Cyber threats cross borders and oceans, and so we look forward to building on our existing relationship with SSSCIP to share information and collectively build global resilience against cyber threats."</p>
<p>"This memorandum of cooperation represents an enduring partnership and alignment in defending our shared values through increased real-time information sharing across agencies and critical sectors and committed collaboration in cultivating a resilient partnership," said Mr. Oleksandr Potii, Deputy Chairman, SSSCIP.</p>
<p>The SSSCIP is the “technical security and intelligence service of Ukraine,” which is under the <a href="https://www.cybersecurityintelligence.com/state-service-of-special-communications-and-information-protection-of-ukraine-ssscip-7222.html">control</a> of President <span>Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</span></p>
