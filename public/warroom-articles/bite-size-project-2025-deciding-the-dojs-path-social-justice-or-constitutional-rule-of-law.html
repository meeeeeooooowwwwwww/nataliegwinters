<p>The U.S. Constitution, while not explicitly mentioning “Rule of Law,” enshrines principles crucial to its concept. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments mandate due process, ensuring fair treatment under the law. The Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause guarantees uniformity in law application. The Constitution’s separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches prevents concentration of power, fostering checks and balances. The Bill of Rights further secures freedom of speech, religion, and fair trials.</p>
<p>Together, these provisions establish a framework to protect citizens from arbitrary government actions and promote a legal system guided by fairness, equality, and constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Those issues should be on the American people’s minds as they vote in November.</p>
<p>One of the significant choices facing the American people this election cycle is whether they prefer a Department of Justice guided by groups like PolicyLink, advocating for far-left policies such as criminal rehabilitation, DEI, and social justice, or one influenced by groups like the Heritage Foundation, which prioritizes Constitutional principles like the Rule of Law in its justice reforms.</p>
<p>Project 2025 is under intense media scrutiny. Let’s examine its reform measures to discover why they’ve sparked such media agitation.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE MEDIA SAYING?</p>
<p>“The 922-page plan outlines <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-conservatives-trump-heritage-857eb794e505f1c6710eb03fd5b58981">a dramatic expansion</a></span> of presidential power and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers to replace them with Trump loyalists. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has worked to draw more attention to the agenda, particularly as Biden tries to keep fellow Democrats on board after his disastrous debate,” the AP <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-project-2025-biden-9d372469033d23e1e3aef5cf0470a2e6">reported</a> on Saturday.</p>
<p>WHY ARE THEY SO FRANTIC ABOUT IT?</p>
<p>Project 2025 faces negative mainstream media coverage, particularly regarding its recommendations on highly charged political issues, like immigration reforms outlined in the DOJ section.</p>
<p><strong>“Examine and consider the appropriateness of withdrawing or overturning every immigration decision rendered by Attorney General Garland (and any successor Attorney General during President Biden’s term),” Gene Hamilton writes on page 567 of the Project 2025 mandate for Conservative Leadership manual that has gotten wide coverage from the media- with most of the coverage from the corporate media being wrong. </strong></p>
<p>WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY?</p>
<p>According to Gene Hamilton, who authored chapter 17 of Project 2025’s manual on the topic of reforming the Department of Justice (DOJ), the DOJ has a long and noble history, beginning with the creation of the Office of the Attorney General in 1789 and evolving through the formation of the department in 1870 and the FBI in 1908, along with reforms following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Hamilton writes that traditionally, the DOJ’s primary functions have been protecting public safety and defending the rule of law within the framework of a constitutional republic. However, in recent years, the DOJ has lost the trust of many Americans, who see it as overly politicized and corrupt, just as WarRoom <a href="https://warroom.org/crisis-of-confidence-the-dojs-integrity-under-scrutiny-ahead-of-the-2024-election/">has reported. </a></p>
<p>This distrust stems from the department being perceived as controlled by an unaccountable bureaucratic class and radical left ideologues, leading to a failure to focus on its core functions. As a result, 46.6 percent of Americans view the DOJ as “too political, corrupt, and not to be trusted.” The weight of publicly available evidence supports these concerns.</p>
<p>HOW DID THE DOJ GET SO CORRUPT?</p>
<p>Project 2025, is in contrast with one of Democrat Joe Biden’s favorite groups, Policy Link, which sponsored Kamala Harris’s sister,  Maya Harris, to author this <a href="https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/organized-for-change">2004 mandate</a> to reform and defund the police.</p>
<p>The very influential group for the left is the same group that <a href="https://x.com/kalimarose/status/1353082824220282880">issued a mandate</a> for the first 100 days of the Biden administration in 2021 and who <a href="https://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/Criminal_Legal_Memo.pdf">continues to lobby</a> the Federal government for more funding for their reform measures- which focus on healing racial issues and healing criminals.</p>
<p>Heritage Action has written a manual and set up an agency to do the opposite of defunding the police and concentrating on the healing of criminals- shifting a legislative and policy agenda to focus the DOJ on public safety and the rule of law.</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF REFORMING THE DOJ, ACCORDING TO PROJECT 2025- RETURN TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND RULE OF LAW</p>
<p>Hamilton writes that the DOJ, under AG Merrick Garland, has strayed from impartiality, becoming a bureaucracy influenced by a radical liberal agenda. Reform is crucial to restore trust and national interest.</p>
<p>Successful reform of the DOJ requires a comprehensive, leadership-driven effort to repair damage and advance national interests, involving both internal changes and legislative support. Focus areas include restoring the FBI’s integrity, renewing attention to violent crime, dismantling criminal enterprises, and addressing national security threats without infringing on constitutional rights.</p>
<p>The DOJ must recommit to protecting public safety and enforcing laws impartially, addressing issues such as immigration enforcement, political bias in prosecution, and the proper handling of misinformation. Ensuring public safety and upholding the rule of law are paramount to regaining public trust and maintaining ordered liberty.</p>
<p>Hamilton explains in great detail that restoring the FBI’s integrity requires comprehensive reforms. Founded in 1908 to tackle national crime and security, the FBI must refocus on violent crime, criminal organizations, child predators, and cyber-crime. Recent scandals, like the Russia hoax and suppression of Hunter Biden’s laptop, indicate the FBI is out of control. A conservative administration should review all major FBI investigations, align the FBI within the DOJ’s structure, prohibit it from policing misinformation, and streamline non-law enforcement functions. Emphasizing field offices over headquarters and proposing to eliminate the 10-year term for the FBI Director are crucial steps in restoring trust and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Gene Hamilton is Vice-President and General Counsel of America First Legal Foundation. Gene served as Counselor to the Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice; Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Homeland Security; General Counsel on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary; Assistant Chief Counsel at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and as an Attorney Advisor in the Secretary’s Honors Program for Attorneys at the Department of Homeland Security. Gene graduated from the Washington and Lee University School of Law magna cum laude and Order of the Coif and has a BA in international affairs from the University of Georgia.</p>
<p>The chapter by Hamilton goes into greater detail on other vital issues.</p>
<p>This is part of a series on the choices the American people have to make in the 2024 election.</p>
