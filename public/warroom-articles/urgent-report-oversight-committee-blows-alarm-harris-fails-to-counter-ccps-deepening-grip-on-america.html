<p>The US House Oversight and Accountability Committee, led by Chairman James Comer, released a staff report on Thursday October 24,  criticizing the Biden-Harris Administration for lacking a comprehensive strategy to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) influence and infiltration efforts in the United States. The report, titled <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCP-Report-10.24.24.pdf">"<strong>CCP Political Warfare: Federal Agencies Urgently Need a Government-Wide Strategy</strong></a><strong>,”</strong> highlights findings from an investigation into 25 federal sectors, revealing that most federal agencies have inadequately addressed the CCP’s tactics. It emphasizes that the CCP views the U.S. as a primary adversary and has deeply infiltrated American institutions, businesses, and cultural spheres.</p>
<p>Key points include the CCP’s use of non-military tactics to influence U.S. communities and critical sectors and federal agencies’ failure to respond effectively. The report assigns agencies scores based on their strategy, knowledge, transparency, and collaboration performance.</p>
<p>Recommendations urge federal agencies to utilize existing resources to combat CCP influence by clearly acknowledging the threat, rejecting general approaches, fostering expertise, and engaging the American public on the CCP’s ambitions. Principled leadership and transparent communication are crucial to countering the CCP’s political warfare.</p>
<p><span>On Friday’s WarRoom, host, and WarRoom contributor, <a href="https://warroom.org/the-stages-of-trumps-victory-from-election-to-inauguration/">Dr. Bradley Thayer</a> discussed the recent Oversight Committee report, and he emphasized that it is a crucial read for all Americans, especially with the upcoming election, highlighting how the CCP is “undermining the foundations of the United States in every respect.” </span></p>
<p><span>Thayer commended the committee’s effort, calling it a “great report” and noting that it’s about 300 pages long. He humorously suggested that it might require more than “one cup of coffee” to get through but assured that “with a pot of coffee,” it’s well worth the time for anyone interested in understanding the CCP threat.</span></p>
<p>The executive summary of the report emphasizes the increasing threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the United States, characterizing it as an aggressive campaign of “unrestricted warfare” targeting all aspects of American society. The CCP is described as a “totalitarian force” that engages in harmful activities, including surveillance, harassment of critics, and the spread of fentanyl, which kills “tens of thousands of Americans every year.” The CCP’s ultimate goal is to “weaken or, if possible, destroy” the United States, viewing the American way of life as a threat to its authoritarian rule.</p>
<p>The report criticizes the Biden-Harris Administration for failing to adopt a government-wide strategy to counter these tactics, noting that out of 25 federal agencies investigated, only the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) showed a clear strategy against CCP-backed activities. However, even the DEA’s efforts are limited due to the lack of a cohesive national approach.</p>
<p>The findings highlight that CCP influence operations have penetrated U.S. borders, institutions, and elites, creating dependencies that hinder effective responses. This contrasts with the unified and efficient strategy of the CCP, which the report claims is fully committed to winning a new cold war against America. “Unlike the first Cold War,” the CCP is already “entrenched within U.S. borders,” manipulating sectors like businesses, universities, and cultural centers.</p>
<p>The report calls for strong leadership to honestly address the CCP threat, stressing the need for a transparent acknowledgment of the problem by federal officials. It concludes that the U.S. must “confront the CCP squarely” to maintain its global preeminence, urging the federal government to communicate clearly with Americans about the risks posed by CCP infiltration.</p>
