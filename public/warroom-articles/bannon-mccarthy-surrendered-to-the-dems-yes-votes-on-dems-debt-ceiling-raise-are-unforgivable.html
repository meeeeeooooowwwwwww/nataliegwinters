<p>Steve Bannon host of War Room rants about McCarthy’s surrender to the Democrats over the debt ceiling. He addresses how work in the Senate and House is far from done and explains how several representatives are working to limit spending and minimize economic damage from the deal. He calls the actions of the 149 representatives who voted yes "unforgivable” and explains how this bill is a Democrat victory with no spending cap or debt ceiling granting President Biden an extraordinary amount of power.</p>
<p>"It’s to take power away from you. Here’s the humiliation, he promised Jefferies 150 votes. With all that pressure they got 149 votes… This is the most important vote of the 118th Congress and I’m really proud of this audience your not falling for all the shiny toys.”</p>
