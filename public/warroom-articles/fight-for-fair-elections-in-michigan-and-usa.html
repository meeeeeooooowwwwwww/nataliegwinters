<p>"ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES." We hear this popular statement every election cycle. But what does it really mean and why is it said?</p>
<p>As a country, we elect leaders to represent us and the lives of our families and communities. Most Americans right now are deeply concerned with issues like inflation, high gas prices, uncertainty over the economy, and potential war overseas.</p>
<p>On Tuesday America will vote. If we elect the right leaders, we start to solve these issues and start putting our country back on a path to prosperity. If we elect the wrong leaders, our nation could take a turn towards tyranny and have our rights further eroded. Therefore, it is critical voters decide who holds office and not fraud and managed corruption we have witnessed in parts of the country, including our state.</p>
<p>Therefore, our voting rights are critical to the survival of our wonderful nation. We must work to ensure that the voting process is secure, honest, and accessible for all citizens.</p>
<p>As your next Michigan Secretary of State, I will depoliticize the office, ensuring that every Michigander irrespective of political affiliation, will equally have their voting rights protected.</p>
<p>We will work to clean up the Qualified Voter File (QVF) to remove dead people and people who are no longer live in Michigan. My office will work diligently to ensure we have accurate voter registration to ensure only legal votes are being cast, because every fraudulent vote, nullifies a vote from an honest hard-working American.</p>
<p>We will work to ensure your ballot is handled securely every step of the way including adding a chain of custody for ballots that are cast absentee and placed in drop boxes.</p>
<p>We will increase citizen oversight during every step of the election process. We must remove the adversarial nature between election volunteers and election workers and work together as a team serving the people of Michigan.</p>
<p>We will work to improve the understanding of the election process. Most Americans believe voting is simply being registered to vote and voting. This has created a situation where we are dependent on "experts." These election experts are rarely truly independent and tell us what to believe and why their plan is best. We must stop simply saying okay to these experts and following the plan that "our side" likes. Michiganders deserve better, so instead, we must ask honest and challenging questions to ensure the best system is in place.</p>
<p>These are some of the failings I am running to improve in our election system. There is one last issue, I wish to discuss with you â€" the current Secretary of State's managed corruption. This ongoing corruption has affected members of both political parties running for multiple offices.</p>
<p>My opponent has habitually broken the law whether it be election law, laws governing administrative procedure, or campaign finance law; among other abuses of power. She consistently participates in trying to intimidate citizens who challenge her. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>My opponent has collected campaign contributions that exceed the legal limit. This is a severe problem, but to make matters worse it is the Secretary of State's job to oversee campaign finance law compliance. Do you really think a corrupt official is going to police themselves, especially if the media turn a blind eye and never report it?</p>
<p>A judge ruled for the fifth time that my opponent broke election law. She previously told clerks to presume signatures on absentee ballots were correct, which was illegal. Recently she gave illegal guidance regarding poll challenger conduct, severally limiting the capability of poll challengers to engage in their lawful duties. She attempted to restrict whom poll challengers could speak with and address their concerns, even trying to restrict them from being able to speak to the local clerk.</p>
<p>She has ongoing legal action against her, for refusing to remove dead people from the qualified voter file (QVF). There is no excuse to keep dead people registered to vote.</p>
<p>She continues to allow non-citizens to be registered to vote â€" people who are in our country lawfully on student or temporary work visas or green card holders who are waiting five years to become citizens. The question is why is the current SoS registering non-citizens? Why is she allowing other government agencies to register them to vote when they request a driver's license unbeknownst to them?</p>
<p>Lastly, our current SoS refuses to explain how in the state of Michigan for the 2020 election we have 170,000 more votes than voters. If you are a concerned citizen and petition your government and ask why you are demeaned and labeled a "threat to democracy."</p>
<p>These constant abuses of power combined with the complete refusal to be held accountable are not what Michigan deserves. It is time for Michigan to elect an honest rule of law candidate to the office of Secretary of State. My name is Kristina Karamo, and I am running to be the next Michigan Secretary of State. I am asking for your vote on Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>Kristina Karamo is a Christian Apologist, mother, and college professor from the metro Detroit area. She is currently a precinct delegate, MiGOP State Committeewoman, member of Michigan's 14th District Republican Executive Committee, and a board member for Stanton Detroit. On national and local media outlets, she has defended the Christian faith, the U.S. Constitution, the right every human being has to life from conception to natural death, and the right of voters to choose their elected officials. She is a graduate of Oakland University with a B.A. in Communications, and an M.A. in Christian Apologetics from Biola University's Talbot School of Theology. Kristina is an American First candidate proudly endorsed by President Trump running for Michigan Secretary of State.</em></p>
