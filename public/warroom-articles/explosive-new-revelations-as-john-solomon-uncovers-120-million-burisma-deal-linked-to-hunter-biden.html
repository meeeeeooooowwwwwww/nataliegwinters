<p>In a Wednesday discussion on the WarRoom program with Steve Bannon, John Solomon from Just the News unveiled significant <strong>new</strong> findings regarding Hunter Biden and the alleged influence-peddling scheme linked to Burisma Holdings. Based on documents obtained over five years, Solomon’s revelations detail a complex web of financial transactions and political maneuvers involving Hunter Biden, his business partners, and Ukrainian oligarchs.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> “It’s an extraordinary story,” Solomon told Bannon, emphasizing that the FBI had these documents as early as 2016, yet they were not made available during Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. He suggested that if the American public had known about this potential $120 million payday for Hunter Biden, it could have influenced the impeachment outcome.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Solomon highlighted that the documents reveal Hunter Biden and his associates had orchestrated a deal to route $120 million from Burisma Holdings to a company they were setting up in Liechtenstein, a known tax haven. This arrangement granted them 25% of all future business profits of Burisma without any initial investment.</p>
<p>Addressing the authenticity and origin of these documents, Solomon explained, “These documents are part of a 3.39 million-page cache turned over to Congress by Devin Archer, one of Hunter Biden’s business partners. They were initially gathered in 2016 during an unrelated securities fraud case involving Hunter Biden and his partners.” The documents, which include business plans and email correspondences, reveal extensive influence-peddling and suggest that the FBI was aware of these activities long before the public became aware.</p>
<p>Solomon further detailed how these documents demonstrate that top State Department officials met with Burisma representatives shortly after an investigation into Burisma was prompted by English authorities at the FBI’s instigation. Solomon told Bannon that this level of access was unprecedented for a company under such intense scrutiny and could only be attributed to Hunter Biden’s affiliation with Burisma.</p>
<p>Bannon questioned Solomon about the FBI’s awareness of and actions regarding these documents. Solomon confirmed that the FBI had the documents and implied this information might have been deliberately suppressed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The FBI had all of these and gathered all of these in 2016 as they were making the bond case,” Solomon stated, hinting at a possible cover-up that extended to high levels within the FBI and the Obama administration.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bannon and Solomon also touched upon the broader consequences of these revelations, suggesting that they could reignite the stalled impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This is going to rekindle or reignite some very important elements in the impeachment inquiry,” Solomon predicted. He emphasized the importance of demanding transparency from the intelligence community and urged Congress to obtain any defensive briefings given to Barack Obama and Joe Biden regarding Hunter Biden’s activities.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion took a critical turn when Bannon speculated on why the FBI and other authorities might have suppressed this information. Solomon responded by pointing out that numerous FBI agents who worked under Andrew McCabe and fed him the story was concerned about the direction in which the bureau was being led under Andrew McCabe, reflecting a broader institutional unease.</p>
<p>Solomon and Bannon exposed the likelihood of influence-peddling and corruption involving Hunter Biden, Burisma, and high-ranking officials, including his father, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>These findings are expected to fuel further investigations and could have significant political ramifications as the details unfold.</p>
