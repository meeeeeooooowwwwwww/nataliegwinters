<p>The regime is going to cheat in the 2024 Election. How do I know? Because they already have.</p>
<p>They’ve never stopped cheating, actually. They cheated in 2016, by spying and then illegally framing President Trump with a Russia collusion hoax. They cheated in 2020, and rigged and stole the election. They haven’t stopped cheating to try to defeat the MAGA movement since.</p>
<p>They’ve falsely imprisoned hundreds of President Trump’s supporters, and advisors. They’ve launched a coordinated effort of fabricated election interference, from the top down of the (In)Justice  Department, against their number one political opponent.</p>
<p>They illegally raided President Trump’s home, engaged in unprecedented lawfare to smear and drag his good name through the press, they’ve forced him to endure multiple <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-witness-nixed-merchans-stringent-rulings-reveals-testimony-would-have-been"><span>rigged</span></a> trials presided by <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/FILE_9517.pdf"><span>corrupt judges</span></a> who impose unconstitutional gag orders to prevent him from pointing out <a href="https://x.com/greg_price11/status/1795862909798514988?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>the corruption</span></a>, attacking his business, his character, and taking him off the campaign trail.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://x.com/greg_price11/status/1745156625596395912?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>declared him guilty</span></a> before he ever stepped foot inside a courtroom, in an effort by a Democrat judge to illegally confiscate his business, for the crime of paying back loans on time and making all the <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1729977387897528661?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>lenders happy</span></a>, like any run of the mill communist country. They arrested him, the opposition candidate, for protesting a rigged election — just like they do <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1831055123050848263?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>in Venezuela</span></a>.</p>
<p>They’ve <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/598604/carroll-v-trump-the-rape-case-that-started-at-a-resistance-party/"><span>cheated</span></a> him out of millions, using illegitimate trials with no defense to force him to pay a lying perverted woman whom he’s never met for a made up story for which she has no date, time, or year and zero proof. They tried to remove him from the ballot. They unleashed an unhinged hatchet man <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/jul/4/jack-smiths-record-rife-mistrials-overturned-convi/"><span>incapable of shame</span></a> to bring bogus charges that keep getting thrown out, but it’s not stopping him from interfering in the election anyway. They invented bogus claims of corruption in Ukraine to <a href="https://x.com/realpatrickwebb/status/1803047481325809780?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>cover up real corruption in Ukraine</span></a>, just like they tried to make it a crime for a President to have presidential records, while letting Biden go for stealing classified documents from a SCIF and store them by his corvette, because he’s <a href="https://x.com/jarvis_best/status/1755686050393894946?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>too old and senile</span></a>.</p>
<p>They secured a predetermined "conviction” against him for a non-crime that the jury never even disclosed what they found him guilty of, in violation of President Trump’s 6th Amendment rights.</p>
<p>All of these <a href="https://x.com/mrddmia/status/1645804835961462785?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>fake indictments</span></a> were coordinated between the Biden-Harris regime and far-left jurisdictions in D.C., New York City, and Atlanta, where the District Attorney was using taxpayer money to <a href="https://x.com/mrddmia/status/1745501884721340650?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>pay</span></a> her <a href="https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1831366987341295819?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>lover</span></a> $700,000 who then billed said taxpayers for his trips to <a href="https://x.com/kanekoathegreat/status/1744847101362896973?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>meet with the White House</span></a>. Eighty-eight indictments, superseding indictments, $175 million bonds, $83 million "judgments,” arraignments, and a mug shot, the fact that Donald J. Trump is still standing, let alone thriving, is a miracle.</p>
<p>And then he got shot.</p>
<p>Since, they’ve pretended like that never happened, and blocked Congress from doing an independent investigation. They <a href="https://warroom.org/that-was-not-a-debate-it-was-a-set-up/"><span>set up a fake debate</span></a> to depose their fake president and install a new nominee, without a single vote. Then the same corrupt regime, with the same republic-ending policies of high crime, high inflation, no borders, and endless wars, suddenly is "tied” with the most powerful political movement in American history. <a href="https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1831345540585435212?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>They’re not</span></a>.</p>
<p>So yes, there will be cheating. It’s all they do. If you haven’t noticed, these people do not play fair. People who play fair don’t <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1832040684137668881?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>object</span></a> to rules that make sure the number of votes matches the number of voters.</p>
<p>They will cheat — they have to. We must do everything in our power to stop them, and it starts by putting them on notice and knowing that our votes are what they fear and what they are fighting so hard against. They do not, under any circumstances, want to allow President Trump to win. But July 13th is a witness to the limits of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2056&amp;version=NIV"><span>what mere men can do</span></a>.</p>
