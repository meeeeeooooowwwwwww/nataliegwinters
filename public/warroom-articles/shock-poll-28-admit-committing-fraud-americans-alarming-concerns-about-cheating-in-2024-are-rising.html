<p>In a recent exchange between Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell, Harnwell articulated profound concerns about the integrity of the upcoming 2024 election, emphasizing that the situation is “terrifying” for several reasons. These concerns are grounded in alarming data from Rasmussen Reports and broader observations about electoral vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most alarming revelation is the finding related to U.S. citizenship. In a poll of 2,500 likely voters, 9% either did not confirm their U.S. citizenship or were unsure of their status despite claiming they voted in the 2020 election. Mitchell describes this as “stunning,” emphasizing that it indicates potential systemic issues.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We had 222 people say either no or not sure when asked if they were U.S. citizens,” Mark Mitchell told Harnwell. “This is a striking indicator that our electoral system might be far more compromised than we previously thought.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Harnwell’s fears are primarily fueled by Mitchell’s insights into voter confidence and the potential for electoral fraud, as revealed on Thursday’s WarRoom.</p>
<p>Mitchell also pointed to self-reported instances of fraud. In his polling, 28% of individuals who voted by mail admitted to committing ballot fraud. This statistic underscores a broader concern that the integrity of the electoral process could be compromised by intentional and unintentional malfeasance.</p>
<p>Mitchell revealed a significant increase in public concern regarding election integrity on the program.</p>
<p>According to Rasmussen Reports, 66% of Americans are now at least somewhat concerned that cheating could influence the 2024 election, marking a notable rise from previous years. Mitchell explains, “We’ve seen a shift from under 50% of the population being concerned about cheating in 2020 to 66% now. This is a bipartisan issue, with 78% of Republicans, 60% of Independents, and 50% of Democrats expressing worry.”</p>
<p>One of the most troubling findings, as highlighted by Mitchell, is the extent of alleged ballot irregularities. “18% of every voter in the country said they received more than one official ballot or a ballot for someone who does not live at their address,” Mitchell notes.</p>
<p>This figure suggests significant issues with mail-in voting procedures, raising questions about how ballots are handled and whether the system is vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
<p>Harnwell amplified the gravity of these revelations by framing them within a broader narrative of electoral manipulation and systemic failure. He asserts that the data points to a deeply flawed system that could lead to severe disruptions in the 2024 election. “These findings are terrifying,” Harnwell says. “They suggest that not only is there a risk of fraud, but there’s also a significant lack of trust in the electoral system itself. The fact that 66% of voters are concerned about cheating and that nearly a third of mail-in voters have admitted to fraud underscores a systemic issue that could undermine the very foundation of our democracy.”</p>
<p>Harnwell’s concerns are compounded by the historical context of the 2020 election and ongoing debates about election integrity. He suggests that the issues highlighted by Mitchell’s data could pave the way for further manipulation and disenfranchisement in future elections. “We’ve seen a lot of talk about electoral fraud and manipulation since 2020,” Harnwell notes. “But these numbers show that the problem is not just talk—it’s a real and pressing issue that could affect the outcome of the 2024 election.”</p>
<p>Harnwell’s analysis exposed a deep-seated anxiety about the state of American democracy. The rising public concern about reported ballot irregularities and troubling citizenship data paints a grim picture of the current electoral landscape.</p>
<p>For Harnwell, based on his comments, these findings are not just numbers—they represent a fundamental threat to the integrity of the electoral process and, by extension, to democratic governance.</p>
