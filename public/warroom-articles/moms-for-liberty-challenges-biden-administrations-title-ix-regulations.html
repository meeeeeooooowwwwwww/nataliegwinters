<p>Moms for Liberty, several states, and the Young America Foundation are taking legal action against the Biden administration’s new Title IX regulations. The lawsuit aims to halt the implementation of these regulations, which are perceived to undermine parental rights in K-12 education. Represented by the Southeastern Legal Foundation and the Mountain States Legal Foundation, <strong>Moms for Liberty argues that the new federal language protecting “gender identity” as a class threatens parental authority and stifles students’ ability to express discomfort in certain situations.</strong></p>
<p>According to a Tuesday press release, Tiffany Justice and Tina Descovich, co-founders of Moms for Liberty, assert that parental rights extend beyond the classroom and that the new regulations will introduce gender ideology into every aspect of schooling, from sports teams to classroom discussions. They emphasize that parents should have the ultimate say in their children’s education and express concern about the potential consequences of the Biden administration’s mandates.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Parental rights do not end at the classroom door. Every parent in America is about to see biological boys on girls’ sports teams and in girls’ locker rooms; and gender identity and sexual orientation will be taught in every classroom across America, whether parents like it or not. They won’t have a choice. Private conversations will happen between school officials and minor school children about changing their gender, and if parents try to fight back they will be the ones in the wrong. This is a huge shift in policy that effectively mandates gender ideology in schools. It is outrageous. Our children GO to public school. They do not BELONG to public school. That is something we will never stop fighting to prove, even if it means going toe-to-toe against the heavy-handed ‘gender identity’ mandates from the Biden Administration,” Justice said. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Justice appeared on the WarRoom Battleground program Tuesday night to talk to Steve Bannon with an update about the details of Biden’s scary usurpations of parent’s rights and free speech issues:</p>
<h1>Tiffany Justice Details The Biden Admin’s War On Title IX</h1>
<p>Kimberly Hermann, counsel for Moms for Liberty at the Southeastern Legal Foundation, characterizes the Department of Education’s revisions to Title IX as violating First Amendment rights. She highlights the implications of forcing children to affirm gender identity changes and warns against suppressing students’ concerns for their physical safety.</p>
<p>The lawsuit cites several examples of concerned parents and students to illustrate the potential impact of the new Title IX regulations. These examples include situations where children face pressure to conform to new pronouns and gender identity terms, encounter transgender students in intimate settings like locker rooms, and experience discomfort or fear due to the presence of individuals of the opposite birth sex.</p>
<p>Merianne Jensen, Tricia Plank, Debbie Lochner, and Rebekah Koznek, representing different regions across the country, shared experiences reflecting the broader concerns of Moms for Liberty. From facing scrutiny for not using new pronouns to witnessing transgender students in locker rooms, these individuals highlight the challenges students and parents may encounter under the new regulations.</p>
<p>From the Press Releases:</p>
<p>Example 1: Merianne Jensen – VA (Moms for Liberty member)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two of her children have a transgender peer in school who they continue to call by her given name and biological pronouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The principal has held an assembly to ask everyone to accept calling by different pronouns or names other than those aligning with biological sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This action by a school administrator confirms our fears that students and parents will be asked to conform with extreme gender ideology politics, even if they do not align with their personal beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need this lawsuit to be successful so we can stop this new Title IX and protect students from being taught ideologies as if they are a scientific fact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2: Tricia Plank – PA (Moms for Liberty member)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her children have received scrutiny from their public school administrators for not using new pronouns and gender identity terms for students who do not "identify” with their birth sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We fear the new Title IX would escalate this scrutiny to outright punishment by the school because they will be pressured to protect "gender identity” of students out of fear of punishment by the federal government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 3: Debbie Lochner- New York (Wayne County Chapter Chair for Moms for Liberty)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her daughter is required to take a swimming class at school, and transgender individuals will be allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her daughter is too scared to speak out on being afraid to share a locker room and change in front of someone of the opposite birth sex. She believes she will be disciplined for going against the rules that protect those who do not "identify” with their birth sex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 4: Rebekah Koznek – California (Vice Chair of Moms for Liberty in San Luis Obispo County)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her children’s school has a transgender student (biological male who used the female locker room) who "twerked” in the faces of female students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her child has autism and cannot correctly process why this student would be in the locker room and she is worried about the child being disciplined if Title IX takes effect as written without protections for students like her child.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Moms for Liberty’s lawsuit seeks to challenge the Biden administration’s Title IX regulations and uphold parental educational rights. By bringing attention to the potential consequences of these regulations and advocating for parental authority, Moms for Liberty aims to protect students and families from what they perceive as overreach by the federal government.</p>
