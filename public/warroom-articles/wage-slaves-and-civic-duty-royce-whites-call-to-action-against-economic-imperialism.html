<p>In his latest address on War Room, Royce White issued a stark warning about the state of American freedom and the role of personal responsibility in addressing systemic issues. Centered around the concept of "wage slavery,” White argued that many Americans have become subjugated by a system of economic imperialism that undermines their true liberties.</p>
<p>According to White, the essence of modern economic oppression lies in the manipulation of citizens’ priorities:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"You have strategically intentionally methodically been made serfs, wage slaves.” He suggested that this economic manipulation is a fundamental aspect of a broader cultural and political decay, one that has been exacerbated by what he described as a Marxist cultural revolution. White pointedly criticized how economic pressures have caused many to prioritize their jobs over their civic responsibilities: "The average American citizen prizes their job more important than their civic duty. There’s nothing American about that.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>His comments critique current societal conditions and a call to action for those who wish to reclaim their autonomy and civic responsibility.</p>
<p>White began by addressing the audience’s everyday challenges, acknowledging the reality of modern life:</p>
<p>"We have jobs. We have families. We have obligations, we have responsibilities.” He recognized that while people have passions outside of politics, these personal commitments should not detract from their civic duties.</p>
<p>However, he argued that many Americans have become "wage slaves” due to a deliberate economic system designed to keep them in servitude.</p>
<p>White’s analysis extends beyond merely critiquing the situation; he also offers actionable advice for those disillusioned by the state of affairs. He challenged the notion that participating in elections is a burdensome or insignificant task: "All you got to do is show up one day on a Tuesday for a United States primary end. We’re going to do it again in November.” White emphasized the ease of voting compared to the larger stakes involved, framing it as a minimal yet crucial action in the fight against systemic issues.</p>
<p>He further underscored the importance of active engagement by comparing it to a sports analogy:</p>
<p>"You don’t practice shooting any extra time… you should expect to miss.” This metaphor illustrates that without diligent effort in political participation, individuals should not be surprised by unfavorable outcomes. White encouraged Americans to take their civic responsibilities seriously, suggesting they should not merely complain about their situation but actively work to change it.</p>
<p>White also addressed those who may feel overwhelmed by the scope of their responsibilities, stating:</p>
<p>"I’m not asking you to go off the grid and throw your electronics away.” He made it clear that he was not advocating for extreme measures but rather for a basic level of involvement, including voting and possibly taking on roles such as election judges or participating in grassroots efforts like door-to-door canvassing.</p>
<p>In his critique of the current political establishment, White expressed frustration with the status quo, which he described as perpetuating "death and debt.” He praised Donald Trump for challenging this status quo, even while acknowledging that Trump is far from perfect. White’s call to action was clear: Americans must actively engage in the political process to challenge and change the prevailing economic and political control systems.</p>
<p>White’s comments on War Room highlight the deep-seated issues of economic oppression and the critical need for civic engagement. By framing citizens as "wage slaves” and emphasizing the importance of political participation, White provides both a critique of the current system and practical advice for those seeking to reclaim their freedoms.</p>
<p>His call is not just for awareness but for action, urging Americans to prioritize their civic duties and take tangible steps to address their systemic challenges.</p>
