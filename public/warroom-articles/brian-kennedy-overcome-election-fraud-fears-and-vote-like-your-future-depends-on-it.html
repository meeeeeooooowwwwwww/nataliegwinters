<p>In a Friday discussion on the WarRoom with Ben Harnwell and Brian Kennedy, Kennedy shared his insights and concerns about the integrity of upcoming elections, focusing on the pervasive fear of electoral fraud. The conversation centered around a recent Rasmussen Reports poll that revealed 65% of Americans are worried that cheating will affect the outcome of the 2024 election. This statistic set the stage for Kennedy to express his strong opinions on past elections and the path forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Look the other side’s not 10 feet tall. They don’t have an absolute power to steal every single election. We can outwork them and make the election very close and decided for President Trump,” Kennedy told Harnwell. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy began by stating, “I’m not surprised at all. The American people saw in 2020 there were these gross anomalies. At best, at worst, the election was stolen.” He reiterated his belief that the 2020 election was manipulated and asserted that similar efforts were made in 2022. Looking ahead to 2024, Kennedy expressed his skepticism about the likelihood of a fair election. However, he remained optimistic about overcoming these challenges, emphasizing the importance of active civic engagement.</p>
<p>“The job for us today is whether we can overcome that,” Kennedy said, urging citizens to take action. He highlighted the role of grassroots efforts and voter mobilization: “It’s not about sitting in just watching the War Room. It’s going to be about in the next coming months, doing more than that.” He stressed the need for people to engage deeply in politics, visiting websites like Protect the Vote and supporting initiatives that promote election integrity.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s message was clear: despite concerns about electoral fraud, citizens must turn out in large numbers and vote, expressing his support for Trump as the candidate who can challenge what he perceives as a “Communist Revolution.”</p>
<p>Kennedy’s remarks also touched on the media’s role in shaping public perception. He compared the modern media to the Soviet Pravda, asserting, “Nearly everything you were hearing from the mainstream media is a lie. Trust none of it, trust only your common sense.” This skepticism toward mainstream narratives was echoed in his advice for voters to rely on their judgment and not be swayed by what he sees as biased reporting.</p>
<p>The conversation also briefly touched on other political figures, with Kennedy defending J.D. Vance against criticisms and highlighting his focus on family values. “He represents a devotion to his family. First and foremost, he thinks the American family needs to be strengthened at every turn,” Kennedy said, contrasting this with what he views as the American left’s radicalism.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s message to the audience was one of vigilance and action. Despite acknowledging the potential for election fraud, he called for increased voter participation to counteract these issues. His call to action was clear: “We’re going to have to outwork the other side. We’re going to have to do everything in our power to get our neighbors, friends, and family voting for the candidate of their choice.”</p>
<p>Kennedy’s advice about the importance of civic engagement in preserving the democratic process, even amidst concerns about its integrity, is very much needed today.</p>
