<p>Teeing up the trailer to his new movie, Flynn the Truth, during a WarRoom interview with host Steve Bannon,  General Mike Flynn, who wrote a blazer over a dark t-shirt which peaked out with the words “Deep State” emblazoned across his chest like this flight with them is tattooed on his soul, tossed out some breaking news to set the stage for the interview.</p>
<p>Flynn, on a road tour to promote his movie and meet the public, told Bannon that he had been served eight subpoenas just the night before. The pursuit of Flynn seems neverending.</p>
<p>After the story he told Bannon about his journey from battlefields to conference rooms since 2015, those subpoenas seemed like a small thing. The historic persecution Flynn and his family have faced since his very brief time in the Trump administration is astounding.</p>
<p>What started with Obama and continues today is the foundation for his latest project, which he explained to Bannon, who was also on the Trump administration at the time.</p>
<p>“Obama told President Trump to stay away from Michael Flynn; he is bad news,” echo the words from the movie’s trailer.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.flynnmovie.com/ref/WARROOM/">WATCH THE FULL MOVIE WITH THE SPECIAL WARROOM LINK:</a></strong></p>
<p>Flynn, a retired United States Army lieutenant general, served as the 24th U.S. national security advisor for a brief period at the beginning of the Trump administration.  Flynn had a distinguished military career, contributing significantly to U.S. counterterrorism efforts and playing pivotal roles in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Flynn first made national news by contradicting Obama when Obama said that the US should not fear ISIS because they were the “JV” Team.</p>
<p>Now, Flynn is a historical figure in the unfolding current events in the United States because of his background, experiences, and service as a high-ranking Democrat General. He is seen as dangerous for his relationship with Donald Trump and because he was one of President Obama’s favorites until he could not be persuaded to lie for the establishment.</p>
<p>There may be no more incredible warrior behind Trump for the America First agenda than Flynn.</p>
<p>A little flashback:</p>
<p>Flynn was just as frank with Bannon as he had been to America about Obama.</p>
<p>Flynn appeared with Bannon on Thursday to discuss his movie and lay the foundation for his continuing historic service to the nation.</p>
<p>Bannon asked Flynn on Thursday how America got to this point in history with Marxist invasions on college campuses and lawfare against trop Trump associates and how he felt about years of Obama and his associates personally going after him.</p>
<p>But unwilling to pass the opportunity to smash the Deep State, Flynn tuned his answer not to reflect on his personal tribulations but to focus his feelings about the usurpations he had seen, and he answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well, the first reason we ended up here today is that Donald J. Trump decided to run for president in the United States, and he beat the Heir Apparent to the Communist regime, Hillary Clinton. That’s number one. Okay. Don’t forget any War Room audience, is that possible? Don’t forget!  Because once that happened their plans to take this country over got shattered. And right now, the American people, this populist movement in our country, are sick and tired of it. They went after Trump so hard, they went after me and that is why we are here.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>COULD FLYNN BE CHOSEN AS TRUMP’S VICE PRESIDENT?</strong></p>
<p>Flynn took the opportunity to rock the WarRoom again. When asked by Bannon if he would accept President Trump’s invitation to be his vice-presidential candidate, Flynn took a brief pause, likely filled with flashbacks from political and legal persecution against him and his family, and answered that he would indeed accept.</p>

<h1>New Movie Tells The Story Of The Deep State Targeting General Michael Flynn For Exposing Corruption</h1>
<p><strong>THE MOVIE TIES IN WITH BREAKING CURRENT EVENTS</strong></p>
<p>The film “FLYNN, Deliver the Truth, Whatever the Cost” provides insights into the deep-seated corruption and weaponization of certain government agencies, particularly the CIA and the FBI, as highlighted by the experiences of General Michael Flynn. The film suggests a broader and alarming picture of how these organizations operate and the extent to which they can be manipulated for political or other purposes, as Flynn reminded his Twitter audience recently:</p>
<p>“I hope the whole WarRoom audience will watch this important movie,” Bannon said on Thursday.</p>
