<p>In a charged episode of Battleground, Alex DeGrasse and his cohort of MAGA strategists—focused on mobilizing key demographics like gun owners and hunters and what sort of messaging needs to be used to persuade them to vote, like economics.</p>
<p>Patrick Kester, Chief of Staff for Rep. Elise Stefanik and an ardent advocate for the Second Amendment, highlighted troubling statistics that reveal a significant portion of gun owners remain unregistered.</p>
<p>According to Kester, there are over 10 million hunters and gun owners nationwide who have yet to register to vote. This untapped voter pool represents a critical opportunity for conservative mobilization, especially in swing states where these numbers could sway election outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, Kester outlined specific figures:</p>
<p>Arizona: 133,000 unregistered voters
Georgia: 350,000
Michigan: 370,000
Minnesota: 261,000
Pennsylvania: 515,000
Wisconsin: 338,000</p>
<p>The strategy is straightforward yet vital: engage with these individuals through local gun clubs, ranges, and community networks to ensure they are registered and prepared to vote. This grassroots approach is seen as a way to not only increase voter turnout but also to counteract what some view as electoral manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>The Economic Angle: Voting with Your Wallet</strong></p>
<p>Alongside the push for increased voter registration among gun owners, there was a notable emphasis on economic issues. The panelists discussed the need for voters to align their choices with their economic values. This involves more than just supporting candidates who advocate for the Second Amendment; it also means voting in a way that reflects a broader concern for economic policies and personal freedoms.</p>
<p>Kester and Luke Mahoney, co-founder of Malko, urged listeners to consider the economic implications of their votes. Mahoney criticized recent Democratic policies as favoring government control over individual liberties and economic freedom. He argued that the current political climate, characterized by expansive government proposals, threatens both economic stability and personal rights.</p>
<p>The discussion also touched on the broader implications of upcoming legislation and policy shifts, stressing that the fight is about gun rights and preserving a free-market economy. As such, voters are encouraged to evaluate candidates on their stance regarding the Second Amendment and their broader economic policies.</p>
<p>The urgency of the conversation was clear: time is running out to register and mobilize voters. With early voting beginning in mid-September, the panel stressed that now is the time for action. They called for a concerted effort to reach out to gun owners, hunters, and other like-minded individuals to ensure they are registered and ready to cast their votes.</p>
<p>Kester emphasized the need for grassroots activism, suggesting that even small efforts—like encouraging a few friends or family members to register—could have a substantial impact. The goal is to build a “tree effect,” where each individual encourages others, expanding the network of engaged voters.</p>
<p>Thursday’s Battleground episode concluded with a rallying cry to the conservative base: engage with your community, mobilize your networks, and vote in alignment with your values. The panelists emphasized that every vote counts, especially in a polarized political landscape where margins can be razor-thin.</p>
<p>By focusing on voter registration, economic awareness, and grassroots mobilization, the MAGA movement aims to harness these key demographics to secure electoral victories and advance their policy goals.</p>
