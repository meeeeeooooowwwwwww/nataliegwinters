<p>US Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) appeared on the WarRoom with Steve Bannon on Friday to update the audience about her actions to unseat Republican Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from his position.</p>
<p>Bannon joined in with some firey comments of support.</p>
<p>Greene reconfirmed to Bannon that her efforts to unmask the hidden power plays in DC was worth the personal attacks she has been subjected to by the uniparty and that she is, in fact, happy to have forced the situation to the point where even Politico had to admit that the Democrats and Johnson, who represents a majority power, have a “power sharing deal.”</p>
<p>For her efforts to defend the GOP’s majority, Greene has been labeled an<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marjorie-taylor-green-idiot-wreck-gop"> “idiot”</a> by Fox News in their temper tantrum.   However, MTG persists.</p>
<p>A recent<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/03/why-johnson-is-stuck-with-threats-to-end-his-speakership-00155792"> Politico</a> article highlighted by Bannon reveals that Democrats are, in fact, pressing for a power-sharing agreement in exchange for supporting Johnson against threats to unseat him from power, led by MTG.</p>
<p>Politico reports that Johnson is stuck, unable to satisfy either side, and his party’s hardliners and Democrats oppose him.</p>
<p>MTG says forcing the power players to admit this power-sharing deal is a significant victory in her ‘Amerca First’ agenda because it shows the American people the reality of what is unfolding with elected officials.</p>
<p>As reported earlier this week on the WarRoom, MTG is pushing for a House vote early next week on a motion to vacate aimed at unseating Johnson.</p>
<p>Bannon supports her efforts.</p>
<p>During her interview with Bannon, he and  MTG focused on that power-sharing agreement between Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives, particularly involving  Johnson and US Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY).  Greene told Bannon that such an agreement compromises Republican values and principles, arguing that the Republican majority in 2022 should not share power with Democrats.</p>
<p>MTG criticized Johnson for allegedly giving in to Democratic demands.  Greene told Bannon that without a strong Republican speaker, the people’s will for bold GOP leadership will be stopped.</p>
<p>She reconfirmed that she is in Washington DC to stand up against what she sees as radical ideologies, even when it comes from Republicans, even if corporate media like Fox News calls her names.</p>
