<p>A green energy company has received over $10 million in <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/bidens-energy-department-funnels-millions-to-beijing-backed-green-energy-company/">grants</a> from the White House since partnering with a Chinese energy company financially linked to Hunter Biden, the son of the President of the United States.</p>
<p>The carbon capture company, LanzaTech, has received the eight-figure sum since April 2021, when the company <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/04/20210417-lanzatech.html">announced</a> its partnership with Sinopec Capital.</p>
<p>Sinopec Capital is the clean energy investment arm of the Sinopec Group, a Chinese Communist Party-run oil and gas enterprise whose <a href="https://www.sinopec.com/listco/en/about_sinopec/subsidiaries/oil_products_sales/20190709/news_20190709_596264612812.shtml">"fully-owned subsidiary"</a> Sinopec Marketing Company enjoyed nearly $1 billion in investment from Hunter Biden's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-hunter-bidens-dealings-in-china-11570181403">private equity firm BHR Partners</a>.</p>
<p>Finalized in March 2015, the investments from the controversial investment <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/biden-cgn-indicted/">fund</a> led to BHR Partners amassing a nearly 30 percent stake in Sinopec. Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hunter-biden-10-percent-stake-chinese-firm-pledge-invest">reportedly</a> still owns a 10 percent stake in BHR Partners, whose LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/en.bhrpe.com/">profile</a> highlights its Sinopec investment, revealing it was involved "in the pilot state-owned enterprise reform deal involving the segregation and capitalization of Sinopec Group's non-oil business into Sinopec Marketing Corporation."</p>
<p>BHR Partners was a joint venture between Rosemont Seneca Partners, an investment fund founded by Hunter Biden and Obama-era Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson in 2009, and the state-owned Bank of China. The billion-dollar fund was notoriously birthed <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/10/6-facts-about-hunter-bidens-business-dealings-in-china/">less than two weeks</a> after Hunter traveled to China alongside his father and then Vice President.</p>
<p>LanzaTech, which has partnered with other Chinese Communist Party-linked entities, appears to retain close links to Beijing, noting in its financial filings that “the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time” and that the company may be unable to “protect our interests” in Chinese joint ventures “by nominating a non-Chinese director to the board of directors of any such joint venture.”</p>
<p>Since partnering with Sinopec, it has received over $10 million in federal grants.</p>
<p>The company appears to align with the Biden White House and World Economic Forum’s agenda to combat climate change using a variety of tactics to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“LanzaTech's carbon recycling technology is like retrofitting a brewery onto an emission source like a steel mill or a landfill site, but instead of using sugars and yeast to make beer, pollution is converted by bacteria to fuels and chemicals! Imagine a day when your plane is powered by recycled GHG emissions, when your shampoo bottle started life as emissions from a steel mill,” writes the company <a href="https://lanzatech.com/about/">about</a> its mission.</p>
<p>The company received a $1,890,001 grant on May 24th, 2021 a $3,894,307 grant on September 24th, 2021, a $3,710,263 grant on September 29th, 2021, and a $2,500,000 grant on September 2nd 2022, according to a U.S. government <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/keyword_search/lanzatech">database</a>. The grants came from the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Among the areas it has received funding from the Biden regime are:</p>
