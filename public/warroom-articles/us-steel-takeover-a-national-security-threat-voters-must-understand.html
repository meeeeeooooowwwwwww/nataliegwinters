<p><strong>The proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by foreign entities poses a significant national security threat according to journalist Adam Molon who appeared on Wednesday’s WarRoom. Americans need to be aware of the potential economic and security implications before voting, as this issue affects not just steelworkers but all families and their financial well-being.</strong></p>
<h3>Why U.S. Steel Matters for National Security</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ussteel.com/">U.S. Steel</a> is an iconic pillar of America’s industrial foundation. Peter Navarro and Adam Molon warn that the acquisition by foreign corporations, especially ones operating in China, would weaken U.S. security. “This deal represents a clear and present national security threat,” Molon noted in a recent interview.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ownership Means Losing Jobs and Benefits</h3>
<p>A takeover could devastate American workers. Union leaders have already expressed their concerns. “Steelworkers are worried whether their jobs, benefits, and pensions will survive this deal,” said Navarro. If foreign companies take over, there’s a high chance of factory closures and outsourcing, leaving thousands of workers jobless.</p>
<h3>The China Factor and National Defense</h3>
<p>The greatest concern is the connection between foreign steel giants and China’s defense industry. Nepan Steel, one of the bidders, has ties to Chinese production facilities. This is alarming because “Nepan operates in China’s Xinjiang province, known for human rights abuses,” Molon stated. America’s steel supply must be protected to maintain the military’s capability to produce tanks, aircraft, and other critical defense equipment.</p>
<h3>Economic Impact on All American Families</h3>
<p>Even if you aren’t a steelworker, this deal affects you. Weakening the steel industry would lead to higher imports, weakening America’s economy. “If foreign companies control U.S. Steel, our entire economy becomes vulnerable,” Navarro warned. The ripple effect could lead to inflation, job losses across industries, and greater reliance on foreign powers.</p>
<h3>Voters Need to Act</h3>
<p>The upcoming election is pivotal for America’s manufacturing future. Voters need to understand that preserving U.S. Steel as an American-owned entity is essential for national security, economic strength, and protecting family livelihoods. As Navarro emphasized, “If Donald Trump gets back in office, he will not let that happen.”</p>
<p>This is more than just a steel issue. It’s about securing our future.</p>
