<p>Americans know that Congress is grappling with escalating tensions, and on Thursday- illustrated by outbursts and scuffles, anyone who didn’t know it before- knows it now. The House of Representatives, in particular, has faced challenges, struggling to elect a speaker twice within a year amidst legislative gridlock and a surge in of betryal to the American people over dire problems like an invasion of the Southern border.</p>
<p>These divisions extend beyond party lines, with internal rifts that corporate media exploit. Recent calls from a few Republicans to remove Speaker Mike Johnson highlight the deepening divide, particularly over issues like the Ukraine aid package, where collaboration with Democrats is viewed as a deepening betrayal.</p>
<p>Greene’s failure to remove Johnson from his position on Wednesday, with only 11 House Republicans supporting the debate, showed the fractured nature of congressional politics today. While Greene garnered some support from Democrats opposed to Johnson’s politics, the overwhelming majority opted to table her motion.</p>
<p>In essence, these developments paint a picture of a Congress mired in division, where partisan interests often supersede a commitment to the American people’s agenda.</p>
<p>In a Thursday WarRoom interview,US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) responded to what some people described as criticism from President Donald Trump regarding her approach to politics. When asked about Trump’s Wednesday call for unity after MTG’s Motion to Vacate Speaker Mike Johnson, Greene defended her actions, stating:</p>
<p>“I think President Trump did a good job with his statement last night. I really do. I think that he showed strong leadership for the entire Republican party but he also acknowledged that Mike Johnson is a good man… But he also acknowledged that he’s not necessarily standing with Mike Johnson’s speakership… I ran for Congress because Republicans didn’t support President Trump… I’m done with that Republican party… We’ve got to get this Republican majority in shape and actually fight… We still have a stolen election from 2020… Election integrity is the number one issue… President Trump has told me personally himself… I will not back off of my colleagues… I will continue to be a thorn in the side against them if they do not do everything they can to support his agenda and protect him.”</p>
<p>Greene emphasized her commitment to holding her party accountable to the values of American First, and supporting Trump’s agenda. She criticized the Republican leadership for not fully supporting Trump during his presidency and vowed to fight for election integrity. Greene also addressed the anger among constituents and urged them to support her efforts. She directed supporters to her social media for more information and assistance.</p>
<p>During the Greene segment, she doubled down on her goals, saying that she entered Congress due to the Republican abandonment of President Trump during his first term, exemplified by Speaker Paul Ryan’s failure.</p>
<p>Adding that she holds the GOP accountable for allowing the politicized pursuit of Trump by Robert Mueller’s special counsel.</p>
<p>MTG told Bannon that she would still try to reshape the Republican majority and ensure a fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Addressing the 2020 election, she emphasized the need for election integrity following concerns raised in recent Georgia hearings.</p>
<p>This steadfastness reflects her determination to advocate for our shared principles and restore integrity to Washington D.C.</p>
