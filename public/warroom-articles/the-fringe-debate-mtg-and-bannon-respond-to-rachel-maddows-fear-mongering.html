<p>In a recent segment of MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, Maddow referred to U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) as “fringe” while discussing Greene’s “controversial” stances on issues such as NATO and American civil liberties.</p>
<p>Key concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fear mongering deliberately spreads alarming or exaggerated information to create public fear or anxiety about a particular issue. This tactic is often used to influence people’s opinions or behavior, usually for political, ideological, or commercial purposes.</li>
<li>The use of the word “fringe” in politics can be a form of fear mongering because it often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that a group or ideology is extreme, marginal, or outside the bounds of acceptable or mainstream opinion.</li>
<li>The word Majority is defined as having “more than half” of something.</li>
</ol>
<p>The political majority in the US in 2023 is a tangled web of partisan bickering, political posturing, and occasional moments of bipartisan cooperation that leave everyone scratching their heads and wondering how we got here- however, it is a fact that Maddow has a difficult time embracing, that the US House of Representatives, (where MTG serves), has the majority- so she is not “fringe” and MTG is not even the “fringe” of the majority since over half the US House of Reps voted along with her – and against NATO.</p>
<p>Let’s do some math- Maddow holds a fringe opinion.</p>
<p>Maddow’s specialty is convincing voters with tactics of fear-mongering that the majority is fringe.  Bannon tells his audience that November 5th, when the American people have a chance to vote – there will be a final judgment on who is fringe.</p>
<p>On Tuesday’s WarRoom program, Greene and Steve Bannon reacted strongly to Maddow’s comments in a conversation covering a wide range of topics from NATO to the Ukraine war and internal U.S. politics- which they claim are accepted and agreed upon by the majority of the American people.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of what they talked about on Tuesday- check yourself for “fringe”:</p>
<p>The NATO Controversy
Greene and Bannon discussed the idea of the United States disengaging from NATO, a topic Maddow found alarming. Greene criticized NATO members for not paying their fair share, suggesting that the burden of defense should not fall disproportionately on the U.S. She argued, “Americans are fed up with funding and paying for the defense of other countries while our country is overrun and our border is ripped wide open.”</p>
<p>Ukraine War Funding
One of the most heated parts of the discussion centered on U.S. funding for Ukraine, particularly in the context of the Azov Brigade, which Greene and Bannon described as having neo-Nazi origins. Greene highlighted her opposition to such funding, stating, “No money to fund the Ukraine war coming from our own military funding… the Department of Defense mission is to protect National Security interests of the United States.” She emphasized that continuing to fund the war in Ukraine puts the U.S. at risk of entering World War III, accusing the Biden administration of escalating the conflict by authorizing military actions inside Russia.</p>
<p>Domestic Politics and the FBI
The conversation also delved into domestic issues, particularly the criticism of the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Greene reiterated her call for impeachment of Merrick Garland, arguing that the DOJ has been politically weaponized against conservatives and supporters of former President Trump. “We need to rip both those departments apart… remove all the people the resistance people that were planted there back when Obama was President,” Greene insisted, emphasizing a need for systematic rebuilding to restore trust in these institutions.</p>
<p>Republican Party Dynamics
Greene expressed frustration with the Republican Party’s response to these issues, urging her colleagues to be more assertive in supporting Trump and conservative causes. She mentioned her disappointment with Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the broader Republican establishment, stating, “The Republican party needs to wake up and see exactly what’s happening… they need to quit just running their mouth.”</p>
<p>Election Concerns in Georgia
Finally, Greene addressed concerns about election integrity in her home state of Georgia, a critical battleground for Republicans. She voiced distrust in certain counties’ election systems, despite recent changes to election laws, and called for greater efforts to ensure a fair process. “Georgia support[s] President Trump… we are a red State and we are Republican through and through,” she declared, while highlighting the Democrats’ strategic focus on Georgia.</p>
<p>Greene and Bannon’s Tuesday discussion showed their Populist foundation. They position themselves as defenders of an “America First” agenda, contrasting their views with what they see as the out-of-touch elite represented by figures like Rachel Maddow.</p>
<p>As political tensions rise and election campaigns intensify in the coming months, the debate over who truly represents the American majority will undoubtedly continue. Greene and Bannon’s narrative of an “America First” agenda is a powerful counterpoint to mainstream media portrayals. As the American public prepares to cast their votes, the question remains: Will the so-called “fringe” be more in tune with the concerns of the majority?</p>
