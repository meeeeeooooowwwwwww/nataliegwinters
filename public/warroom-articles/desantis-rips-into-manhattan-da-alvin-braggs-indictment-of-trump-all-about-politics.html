<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to tiptoe toward the Republican presidential primary race with a visit to Nassau County Saturday — his <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/21/trump-pal-vito-fossella-skips-staten-island-ron-desantis-event/">second New York City-area appearance</a> in less than six weeks — while taking a swipe at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his prosecution of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"This guy is all about politics,” DeSantis said of Bragg, who he decried as "a menace to society.”</p>
<p>"His whole thing is he doesn’t want people to be in jail, he wants to downgrade felonies to misdemeanors,” DeSantis said.</p>
<p>"Really, really dangerous stuff.</p>
<p>"And then he turns around, does a flimsy indictment against a former president of the United States. All these legal gymnastics to act like this is a felony – when almost every other time, he’s trying to take the felonies and downgrade them,” DeSantis exclaimed.</p>
<p>"This guy is doing politics! He has an agenda – that is not the rule of law,” he said, earning a standing ovation from the crowd.</p>
<p>DeSantis did plenty of pro-Florida boosting in his 50-minute speech.</p>
<p>"For over four years, we don’t have leaks, we don’t have palace intrigue,” he said of his administration, speaking to about 600 guests in the glass-walled atrium of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City.</p>
<p>"We just execute the agenda,” he boasted — in what seemed to be a swipe at former president Donald Trump’s chaotic administration.</p>
<p>But the governor carefully avoided any mention of Trump’s name.</p>
<p>Instead, he hammered President Joe Biden with gusto.</p>
<p>"Our president, Joe Biden — he’s weak, he’s floundering,” DeSantis said dismissively.</p>
