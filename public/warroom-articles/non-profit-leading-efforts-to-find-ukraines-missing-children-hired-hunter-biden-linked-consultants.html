<p>An American non-profit leading efforts to find missing Ukrainian children hired a consulting firm tied to Hunter Biden, War Room can reveal.</p>
<p>The charity, Humanity for Freedom, retained Blue Star Strategies on May 15th, engaging CEO Karen Tranmontano for lobbying work, according to federal <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/RR/301472718.xml">paperwork</a>. The notorious firm will <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/r/301042120">work</a> to "educate and advocate for the U.S. government to maintain its support for Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Blue Star Strategies has been under <a href="https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2021/06/03/blue-star-burisma-justice-department-investigation-491681">investigation </a>by the Justice Department for unregistered foreign lobbying to boost the public image of Ukraine-based energy company <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/26/hunter-bidens-ukraine-salary-was-cut-after-joe-biden-left-office/">Burisma Holdings</a> in November 2015. During that time, Hunter Biden served on Burisma’s board, collecting <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna29462">sizable </a>retainer fees.</p>
<p>Emails <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/21/emails-show-hunter-biden-ties-to-head-of-lobby-firm-in-doj-probe/amp/">obtained</a> from the "<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9665695/Hunter-Bidens-relationship-D-C-consultancy-firm-federal-investigation-revealed.html">hard drive from hell</a>” appear to show Hunter Biden playing a crucial role in the scandal-plagued energy firm’s decision to proceed with hiring Blue Star Strategies.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden told Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi: "Let me have one final call with them and verify once more that they understand the scope so we can all feel the retainer is in line with the work required. I trust [Blue Star co-founder] Sally [Painter] and Karen implicitly so I believe we are all aligned but I want to have one last conversation with them to confirm before we proceed.”</p>
<p>Two days later, Hunter reiterated in an email to Pozharskyi that "[Fellow Burisma board member] Devon [Archer] and I do feel comfortable with BS [Blue Star] and the ability of Sally &amp; Karen to deliver … Looking forward to getting started on this.”</p>
<p>Given the ties between Blue Star Strategies and Hunter Biden, the consulting firm’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/r/301042120">work</a> on behalf of pro-Ukraine charity Humanity for Freedom appears curious. The <a href="https://www.humanityforfreedomfoundation.org/">charity</a> is responsible for the "Return The Children” campaign, which claims the Russian government is "stealing and exploiting” Ukrainian children:</p>
<blockquote><p>"There is no clearer example of the evil of authoritarianism than Putin and his enablers kidnapping, torturing, and brainwashing tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Humanity for freedom foundation is working to find and document these stolen and exploited children as well as helping reunite them with their families.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, the group published a video to officially launch its "#ReturnTheChildren” campaign:</p>
<p>The issue of Ukraine’s missing children, however, has been plagued with conflicting accounts about children being sold into sex slavery and forced organ harvesting.</p>
<p>Humanity for Freedom enjoys "<a href="https://pressat.co.uk/releases/humanity-for-freedom-a-new-global-voice-for-freedom-arises-in-the-urgent-fight-against-authoritarianism-480936ecf1e46623b5a1ba12d94c056d/">support</a>” from the Ukrainian government and was founded by Aaron Kaufman, the co-Director of Sean Penn’s film lauding Volodymyr Zelensky, Superpower.</p>
