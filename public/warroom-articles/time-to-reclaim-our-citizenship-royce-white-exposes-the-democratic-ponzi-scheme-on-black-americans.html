<p>In a fiery monologue during his guest-hosting appearance on Steve Bannon’s War Room, Royce White delivered a powerful critique of the current political climate, with a specific focus on the concept of citizenship and the Democratic Party’s manipulation of the Black community. White, speaking from Minneapolis, did not hold back in his assessment of how the idea of democracy has been twisted and used as a tool for control rather than a genuine expression of the people’s will.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We are coming. The people are coming,” White declared, emphasizing the need for individuals to embrace their citizenship, uphold the truth, and reclaim their autonomy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>White began by challenging the Democrats’ constant use of the word “democracy,” arguing that it has become a form of “gaslighting” rather than a true reflection of America’s governance. “We live in a constitutional Republic,” White asserted, clearly distinguishing between the ideals of democracy and the reality of the political system. He criticized what he described as the “heresy of democracy,” a concept that assumes “all majorities are made right and equal.” In White’s view, not all majorities are righteous or just, and the blind acceptance of majority rule can lead to tyranny.</p>
<p>Transitioning into a discussion about the Black community, White offered a historical perspective on how African Americans have been systematically manipulated, drawing on the infamous figure Willie Lynch, known for his brutal methods of controlling slaves. White described how Lynch’s tactics were designed not just to physically subdue Black people, but to psychologically break them. “If you can break the image of the Black man in the mind of the Black woman, she will raise her offspring in reverse roles,” White explained, highlighting the long-lasting impact of this psychological manipulation.</p>
<p>This, White argued, is emblematic of how the Democratic Party has continued to exploit the Black community, building a political coalition “mainly on the backs of a Black narrative that undoubtedly is intended to take their freedom from you.” He contended that the Democrats’ promises, particularly those offering protection from white supremacy through the expansion of federal government power, are nothing more than “a scam, a Ponzi scheme.” White lamented that the Black community has been kept in a state of dependency and fear, largely due to the promises of safety and security from a government that ultimately does not deliver.</p>
<p>White’s critique extended to the failure of the Democratic Party to fulfill its promises, leading to growing disillusionment within the Black community. “When lies build up to that level of contradiction, people start to fall off the bandwagon,” White said. He pointed to the example of Joe Biden’s infamous remark, “If you don’t vote for me, you ain’t Black,” as a blatant insult to the intelligence and autonomy of Black voters.</p>
<p>White praised Donald Trump as a transformative figure who has begun to break the psychological hold the Democrats have had over Black Americans. He noted that Trump’s straightforward approach has resonated with many Black men, leading to a significant shift in political allegiance. “Black men all across this country now poll for him at 51%,” White stated, marking it as the highest support for a Republican presidential candidate among Black men in recent memory.</p>
<p>In his closing remarks for the opening segment, White issued a call to action, urging Black Americans to rise up and reject the Democratic Party’s control.</p>
<p>He called on people to rely on the Bible and the Constitution as guiding documents, asserting that these hold real value in Americans’ lives. White’s message was clear: it is time for the Black community to break free from the chains of political manipulation and take an active role in shaping the future of the nation.</p>
