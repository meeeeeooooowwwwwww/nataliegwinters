<p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is funding a Chinese Communist Party-run university’s efforts to make countries more reliant on China for healthcare products, <em>War Room</em> can reveal.</p>
<p>The Microsoft founder’s philanthropic group <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2022/10/inv-045529">announced</a> a $414,870 grant to Tsinghua University to “leverage R&amp;D capabilities in China to provide innovative and low-cost global health products,” according to a summary.</p>
<figure><figcaption>GRANT DETAILS.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tsinghua University has a history of launching cyberattacks <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cbf22f3c-a1f9-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4">against</a> the U.S. government and having a "clear connection" to Beijing on national security matters, <a href="https://www.state.gov/implications-of-chinese-intellectual-property-violations-on-developing-telecommunications-infrastructure/">according</a> to the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>The school is also the alma <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/news/who-tedros-xi-jinping-alma-mater/">mater</a> of regime leader Xi Jinping and hosts a "Marxist" journalism school. It <span>has also been flagged as </span><a href="https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/universities/tsinghua-university/">"very high risk"</a><span> for the work it carries out to advance China's military.</span></p>

<div>Despite these ties, the Gates Foundation sent nearly $500,000 to the school to boost its research and development on “global health products.”</div>

<p>While details about how the objective would be accomplished were committed, the grant appears to<span> bolster the objectives of China’s "Belt and Road" </span><a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/11/09/biden-climate-advisor-lauded-chinas-bri/">initiative.</a></p>
<p>As the U.S. State Department has warned, Beijing "uses the Belt and Road Initiative and other undertakings to expand foreign markets for Chinese companies and as a means of drawing nations, particularly their political and economic elites, into Beijing's geopolitical orbit." <span>China has been </span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-exploiting-pandemic-advance-its-interests-mixed-results">accused</a><span> of using similar tactics amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, engaging in "healthcare diplomacy" to broaden its influence over developing countries. </span></p>
<p><span>Products manufactured in the country also often have poor </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/pfizer-picks-china-firm-involved-in-drug-recall-for-covid-pill">efficacy</a><span> and are tainted with toxic </span><a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/fda-recalls-chinese-medicine-drug-for-lead-contamination">chemicals</a><span>.</span></p>

<p>The unearthed grant <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/07/20/gates-foundation-funds-chinas-science-ministry/">follows</a> Bill Gates's decades-long history of collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party on various <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2020/08/27/microsoft-ccp-operating/">business</a> and philanthropic ventures. His eponymous foundation appears to demonstrate a similar affinity for the Communist regime, sending six-figure grants to Chinese Communist Party-controlled <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/11/23/exc-gates-foundation-sent-over-54-million-to-china-since-covid-including-to-wuhan-collaborators/">entities</a>, including those with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=GATES+WUHAN+NATIONAL+PULSE+CHINA+WINDWOS&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsYYXXtK_B5kI4b3tz-EYs5QttS_Jw%3A1661643790621&amp;ei=DqwKY_G5Je_i5NoP65KzmA0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx-Ie_mej5AhVvMVkFHWvJDNMQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=GATES+WUHAN+NATIONAL+PULSE+CHINA+WINDWOS&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANKBAhBGAFKBAhGGABQ0whY2BpgiRtoBnAAeACAAWqIAY8HkgEEMTIuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz#:~:text=Gates%20Foundation%20Is,com%20%E2%80%BA%20News">ties</a> to the lab believed to be the birthplace of COVID-19.</p>
