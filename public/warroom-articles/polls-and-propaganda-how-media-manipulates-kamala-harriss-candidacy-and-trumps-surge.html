<p>In recent weeks, the political landscape has been marked by an intriguing juxtaposition of poll results and media narratives that are mostly confusing to political watchers. Mark Mitchell, a prominent figure in political polling for Rasmussen polls, raised alarm bells on Saaturday’s WarRoom, over what he describes as a deliberate effort by mainstream media to skew perceptions of Kamala Harris’s candidacy and downplay Donald Trump’s resilience.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s critique centers on the stark contrast between the media’s portrayal of Harris and the actual data from his polling firm.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"If you go to Real Clear Politics, you’ll see a sea of blue polls showing Kamala Harris beating Donald Trump,” Mitchell pointed out. "Yet our numbers, released last Thursday, show Trump still beating her nationally by five points in both two-way and multi-way matchups.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>According to Mitchell, this discrepancy underscores a troubling trend: despite Harris’s historically low approval ratings and lackluster polling performances, media outlets continue to present her as a formidable contender.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s skepticism extends beyond just the numbers. He argues that the media’s narrative—characterizing Harris as a rising star—serves a dual purpose: it pressures the Trump campaign and attempts to mitigate the negative impact of Harris’s unimpressive track record.</p>
<p>"They’re trying to maximize the effect of the few positive polls she has and put pressure on the Trump campaign,” Mitchell observed. "I think they’re trying to minimize the stink of incompetence that she has.”</p>
<p>This pattern of media distortion, Mitchell argues, is not unprecedented. On the WarRoom, he drew a parallel with the 2016 election, where mainstream polls heavily favored Hillary Clinton. "Back in 2016, there were numerous polls showing Clinton with a double-digit lead over Trump on election day,” Mitchell recalled.</p>
<p>"Despite this, Trump won the Electoral College, proving that the media’s polling often fails to capture the true sentiment of the electorate.” Mitchell’s point is clear: media manipulation of polling data is a recurring issue designed to influence public perception rather than reflect reality.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity, Mitchell noted to WarRoom host Royce White, that despite Harris’s poor track record on critical issues such as border control and overall favorability, the media continues to push a positive narrative. "Kamala Harris has never pulled better than Joe Biden,” he stated. "Her record is abysmal, with 49% of voters saying she has done a poor job on the borders, and only 19% believing she’s better than recent vice presidents.” This stark contrast between her actual performance and media portrayal raises questions about the motivations behind such reporting.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s concern about the integrity of polling data is further evidenced by the lack of recent national numbers from major polling firms, he told White.</p>
<p>"We’re the only ones putting out fresh national data this week,” he said. "Others have outdated numbers from early August or earlier. The absence of current data from major pollsters indicates a potential effort to suppress unfavorable findings about Harris.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mitchell advised scrutiny of future polls to uncover any biases or methodological flaws.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Watch for oversampled Democrats or shifts in how data is weighted,” he suggested. "The industry is carrying water for Harris, and it’s crucial for voters to understand the real dynamics of this race.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Mitchell’s remarks expose what he sees as a concerted effort by the media to distort the reality of Kamala Harris’s candidacy and Donald Trump’s standing.</p>
