<p>In a recent WarRoom conversation, Steve Bannon and Garrett Ziegler discussed their perspectives on the investigations into Hunter Biden and the broader implications that led to calls for scrutiny of President Joe Biden. This dialogue highlighted their contrasting views with corporate media and political critics, who often label their efforts to promote an America First agenda- as “retribution,” while Bannon and Ziegler frame their actions as seeking “justice.”</p>
<p><em>American justice is a comprehensive system designed to uphold the rule of law and protect individual rights. Key principles include the rule of law, due process, equal protection, presumption of innocence, right to a fair trial, and checks and balances. The system comprises judicial courts, law enforcement agencies, legislative bodies, and correctional institutions, all working together to ensure accountability, deterrence, rehabilitation, restitution, and public safety. Guided by constitutional principles, American justice aims to provide fair treatment, prevent discrimination, and maintain social order through a balanced approach of punitive and rehabilitative measures.</em></p>
<p><em>Retribution is revenge. That is what lawfare is about, and that is what the opponents of President Trump are doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Retribution focuses on punishing wrongdoers in proportion to their offenses, driven by emotions like revenge. It looks backward, aiming to make offenders suffer for their actions as deserved. In contrast, justice prioritizes fairness, equality, and the rule of law. It seeks a balanced approach that considers the Constitutional rights of all parties, aiming for rational and objective outcomes. Justice is forward-looking, emphasizing rehabilitation, deterrence, societal harmony, and accountability.</em></p>
<p>On Thursday, Ziegler and Bannon presented their points of view on the difference, and they are powerful.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“If the president is compromised, which we know he is, there are few more important issues. And the media crocodile tears about retribution are wrong, all we want is Justice. What they’re fearing is a return to Constitutional government. If Hunter Biden didn’t commit crimes, we’re not advocating that he get charged, we want Justice.  They don’t understand that because they are atheist and because they have no background in Western Civilizaation or Christianity, they can’t answer the question. What is Justice to them? Was justice to them is whatever feels good and whatever supports my side. They can’t even provide a definition of Justice that they have. They literally do not know what the words that they use mean- they have no clue,” Ziegler told Bannon. </strong></p>
<p><strong>“Accountability Day is coming,” Bannon affirmed, referring to election day.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Thursday WarRoom discussion opened with Bannon addressing Ziegler’s experiences and the personal lawsuit attacks he has faced from the  Biiden family. Bannon sarcastically asked if the Biden family ever apologized to Ziegler after Hunter Biden’s conviction, to which Ziegler responded with criticism of the Biden family, particularly Jill Biden.</p>
<p>Bannon described the Biden family as a “pack of feral dogs” and accused them of dishonesty and corruption. Ziegler’s commentary underscores his disdain for the Bidens and his belief in their guilt as well.</p>
<p>Ziegler delved into specific allegations involving Hunter Biden, such as the alleged mishandling of classified information and obstruction of justice. He criticized the handling of the investigation and suggested that key figures, like Mark Zaid, were involved in covering up crucial evidence. Ziegler expressed frustration over the perceived leniency in prosecuting those associated with the Bidens, contrasting it with the aggressive pursuit of lower-level individuals in other cases.</p>
<p>The discussion also addressed the systemic issues within the justice system, particularly under the current administration- Bannon and Ziegler agreed that Merrick Garland is covering for the Biddens.</p>
<p>Ziegler touched on the timeline of  Hunter Biden’s legal troubles, which have been ongoing and complex, involving multiple investigations and allegations and numerous associates accused of covering up for his criminal activity- which likely led to his family and his father as Vice President and President.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline summarizing the key events:</p>
