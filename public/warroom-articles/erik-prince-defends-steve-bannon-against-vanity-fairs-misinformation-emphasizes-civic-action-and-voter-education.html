<p>Erik Prince’s reaction<span> on Thursday’s WarRoom to a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/steve-bannon-nato-world-order">Vanity Fair article</a> criticizing Steve Bannon and his followers was sharp and revealing. According to Prince, the article </span>was full of misinformation about Bannon’s true mission. He highlighted Bannon’s dedication to empowering voters through “nonviolent civic action” and providing crucial information for informed electoral choices. The Vanity Fair piece missed the mark, portraying Bannon’s strategy as far more radical than it actually is.</p>
<h2>Vanity Fair’s Misinformation on Steve Bannon’s Mission</h2>
<p>The Vanity Fair article in question painted Steve Bannon and Prince as dangerous instigators.  It falsely suggested that the WarRoom and its audience promote aggressive and even violent tactics.</p>
<p>Erik Prince quickly addressed these inaccuracies. Bannon has been crystal clear—he’s calling for peaceful civic participation. Bannon’s WarRoom encourages people to get involved in their local communities, run for office, and work within the system, not against it.</p>
<p>In his defense, Prince emphasized that Bannon’s strategy revolves around constitutional principles and civic engagement.</p>
<p>The goal, as WarRoom viewers know, is to inspire voters to “stand up, speak out, and act within the law.”</p>
<p>The WarRoom’s mission, according to Prince, is about giving the American people the information they need to make informed choices at the polls—not to incite disorder.</p>
<h2>Erik Prince Stresses Civic Action and Nonviolence</h2>
<p>One of Prince’s key arguments is that the WarRoom’s approach is grounded in nonviolent civic action. “Everything Bannon talks about,” Prince stated, “is about playing within the system.” This means pushing back against globalism, holding elites accountable, and reshaping the American government to serve its people better—all through legal, democratic means.</p>
<p>Prince pointed out how Bannon consistently reminds his audience to get involved in school boards, local councils, and community organizing. This is where real change happens. It is the opposite of the radical narrative pushed by Vanity Fair.</p>
<h2>Voter Education: Empowering the American People</h2>
<p>Beyond the misinformation, Prince stressed the importance of Bannon’s WarRoom in providing “news and information that helps voters make choices.” For Prince, this is a critical service in an era where mainstream media often fails to cover the concerns of everyday Americans. Bannon’s focus is on informing the public about immigration, the economy, and national security—issues that directly impact voters but are often glossed over in mainstream narratives.</p>
<p>As Bannon knows "If you give voters the facts, they will make the right decision.” This is where Bannon’s influence lies: arming voters with the facts and encouraging them to engage actively in the democratic process. For all the negative press, this is what the WarRoom is about—educating and empowering voters, not undermining the system.</p>
<h2>The Role of the WarRoom in Restoring American Greatness</h2>
<p>Prince also credited Steve Bannon with having foresight on key issues like immigration, the military, and America’s global standing. “Steve’s been right for a long time,” Prince remarked. Bannon’s stance against endless wars, open borders, and unchecked financial elites resonates with many Americans. He has effectively connected these issues with the broader goal of restoring American greatness.</p>
<p>Vanity Fair may dismiss Bannon as a radical, but Prince made it clear that Bannon’s strategy is about empowerment and lawful action. He summarized the WarRoom’s mission as a movement rooted in “Jacksonian accountability,” aimed at cleaning up the dead wood in government while ensuring the American people remain informed and engaged.</p>
<h2>Misinformation and Media Bias</h2>
<p>The blistering Vanity Fair article may have tried to undermine Steve Bannon, but as Erik Prince emphasized, it missed the real story. The WarRoom isn’t about incitement—it’s about informed, nonviolent civic action. Prince’s defense of Bannon highlights the critical role the WarRoom plays in educating voters and promoting democratic engagement.</p>
