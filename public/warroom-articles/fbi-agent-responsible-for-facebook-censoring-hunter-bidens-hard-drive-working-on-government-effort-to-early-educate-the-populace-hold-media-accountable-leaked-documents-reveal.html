<p>Laura Dehmlow, a senior <span>Federal Bureau of Investigation agent </span>who played a key role in Facebook’s decision to censor stories about Hunter Biden’s hard drive, called for a media infrastructure that will “early educate the populace,” according to leaked documents from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>“According to records filed in federal court, two previously unnamed FBI agents — Elvis Chan, an FBI special agent in the San Francisco field office, and Dehmlow, the section chief of the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force — were involved in high-level communications that allegedly "led to Facebook's suppression" of the Post's reporting,” <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/">explained</a> The Intercept, which first reported years of internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memos, emails, and documents.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lhfang/status/1587102997317722113?s=20&amp;t=JQgRihzzoGqESK1LALMG3Q">Notes</a> from a March 1st meeting held by a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) subcommittee, “Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Misinformation &amp; Disinformation (MDM),” revealed Dehmlow’s continued influence over the federal government’s approach to censorship.</p>
<p>In addition to briefing attendees on “Russian influence on the elections,” Dehmlow was “<span>asked to provide her thoughts or to define a goal for approaching MDM,” according to a newly obtained meeting summary.</span></p>
<p>In response, she insisted that the “media infrastructure” needs to be “held accountable” and that “we need to early educate the populace”:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>“She stated we need a media infrastructure that is held accountable; we need to early educate the populace; and that today, critical thinking seems to be a problem currently.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Meeting documents reveal that Twitter’s Legal, Public Policy, and Trust and Safety Lead was in attendance.</p>
