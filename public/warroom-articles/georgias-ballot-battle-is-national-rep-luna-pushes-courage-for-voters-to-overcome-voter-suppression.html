<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna appeared on the WarRoom on Wednesday and voiced grave concerns about voter intimidation and suppression tactics observed during the Georgia runoff elections. Her remarks underscore the critical need for vigilance and action to ensure fair and accessible elections for all Americans.</p>
<p>Luna’s experience on the ground in Georgia revealed disturbing efforts to undermine voter turnout, which she described as part of a broader strategy around the nation to suppress Republican votes. Luna highlighted her firsthand observations of left-wing funded efforts to deter voters.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>She noted, “We were actually touring the state getting up to vote for some of our Senate candidates. There was actually a group of people putting up billboards funded by the left-wing, intentionally trying to suppress voter turnout.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>These billboards, according to Luna, conveyed messages aimed at discouraging potential voters by suggesting that their votes wouldn’t count, thereby undermining electoral participation.</p>
<p>This kind of intimidation, she argues, is part of a larger pattern of bias and manipulation. Luna is alarmed by what she perceives as a double standard in how voter suppression is handled. She expressed frustration over how conservative voices are often censored while similar or more severe actions by the left go unchecked.</p>
<p>“If you color outside the lines, we get deplatformed and censored. Leaders of Congress can call for outright insurrections, yet if it’s done on the right, we’re treated as domestic terrorists,” Luna criticized.</p>
<p>To counteract these tactics and protect the integrity of elections, Luna calls for proactive measures. She urges voters to be aware and engaged, emphasizing the importance of participating in elections and ensuring that every vote counts. “If you see something, say something,” she advises, stressing the need for vigilance and reporting any suspicious activities that could undermine the electoral process.</p>
<p>Luna also highlighted the need for comprehensive monitoring and legal action to address voter suppression. She points to efforts by the RNC and other organizations to establish a network of attorneys to combat illegal activities related to voter fraud and intimidation.</p>
<p>“There’s a massive, massive voter registration and get-out-the-vote effort,” she notes, advocating for continued grassroots mobilization and legal safeguards.</p>
<p>She encouraged voters to take personal responsibility in ensuring their votes are counted, suggesting using resources like <strong><a href="https://protectthevote.net/">ProtectTheVote.org</a>
</strong>to track mail-in ballots and verify their receipt. For those who can, she recommends voting in person to avoid potential issues with mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>“Make sure that you’re tracking your ballot if you’re voting by mail. I would prefer people vote in person,” Luna said.</p>
<p>Her concerns extend to the broader implications of voter intimidation and suppression on democratic engagement. Luna fears these tactics, if left unchecked, could erode trust in the electoral system and disenfranchise many voters. “We cannot afford to have these people engaging in this activity,” she warns, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a fair and transparent electoral process.</p>
