<p><strong>U.S. national security is facing unprecedented threats from China under the Biden-Harris administration, according to WarRoom experts. From military escalation in the Indo-Pacific to political influence campaigns, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) aims to undermine U.S. power and disrupt global peace. The stakes are rising, and November’s election could determine the direction of U.S. foreign policy in the face of these dangers, according to a Wednesday discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and Capt. Jim Fanell.</strong></p>
<h3>China’s Missile Test: A Clear Threat to U.S. Security</h3>
<p>China launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test in the South China Sea in 44 years. This missile, likely a<a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/25/china-test-fires-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-pacific-ocean.html"> DF-41</a>, has a range of up to 9,000 miles, capable of hitting U.S. targets. Col. Jim Fanell described the test as “shocking,” emphasizing that China is "practicing to destroy America.” The implications are stark: China’s strategic rocket force is growing more capable, and their political will to confront the U.S. is undeniable.</p>
<h3>Loss of Key U.S. Base: China’s Quiet Victory in the Indo-Pacific</h3>
<p>Recent developments also threaten America’s strategic presence in the Indo-Pacific. The United Kingdom turned over Diego Garcia, a joint U.S.-UK military base in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius. Fanell compared this loss to the situation in Afghanistan, stating, “We will now potentially lose access to Diego Garcia,” a move he called a victory for China. This jeopardizes U.S. ability to project power in the region and undermines security alliances with key partners like Japan and India.</p>
<h3>Chinese Aggression Against the Philippines and Taiwan</h3>
<p>China’s aggression isn’t limited to military exercises. The CCP has intensified threats against the Philippines and Taiwan, both critical U.S. allies. According to Fanell, “China is effectively trying to take over the South China Sea,” a crucial global shipping lane where $5 to $7 trillion of the world’s GDP passes through. By controlling these waters, China aims to push the U.S. out and dominate regional trade.</p>
<p>Regarding Taiwan, Fanell warned of increased provocations: "Crossing the center line with combat aircraft used to happen only a few times in 60 years. Now, it’s happening hundreds of times a year under the Biden-Harris regime.” Taiwan’s status as a self-sustaining democracy challenges China’s authoritarian model, and Beijing is ramping up its threats of force.</p>
<h3>The CCP’s Military Expansions are Unchecked</h3>
<p>Beyond Taiwan, China has made unprecedented moves against Japan, flying military aircraft into Japanese airspace and navigating warships within 12 nautical miles of Japanese territory. Fanell highlighted the seriousness of these moves, stating, "They haven’t operated that far south before.” China is also expanding its military influence in Cambodia and along the Sino-Indian border, further destabilizing the region.</p>
<p>North Korea’s Growing Threat
Fanell also pointed to the evolving threat from North Korea, which recently cut ties with South Korea and may be developing its own ballistic missile submarine. This adds another layer of complexity to an already tense situation in the Indo-Pacific. “If China decides to act in any of these regions, the U.S. military will come under attack,” Fanell warned.</p>
<h3>Political Warfare and Influence Campaigns</h3>
<p>China’s actions aren’t limited to military threats. Fanell and Thayer discussed how the CCP is employing political warfare to influence global perceptions and, potentially, U.S. elections. The CCP’s messaging, including the ICBM test, spy balloon incidents, and aggressive rhetoric, is meant to demonstrate China’s power and discourage American resistance. "The Chinese Communist Party is sending powerful messages that their intent is to hurt the American people,” said Thayer.</p>
<h3>A Call for Leadership</h3>
<p>Fanell concluded with a stark message: the CCP’s pressure will continue, and the current administration’s "neo-engagement” strategy isn’t working. The November election is pivotal, as the Chinese Communist Party “has a preferred candidate,” according to Fanell. Leadership capable of confronting these threats is crucial to safeguarding U.S. interests and global stability.</p>
<p>Voters must ask the question: Will America’s next leader have the strength to resist China’s aggression?</p>
