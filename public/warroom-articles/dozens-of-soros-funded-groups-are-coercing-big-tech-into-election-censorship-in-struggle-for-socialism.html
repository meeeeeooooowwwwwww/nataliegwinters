<p>Left-wing non-profits receiving tens of millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros are working to ensure technology companies and social media platforms engage in heavy-handed censorship throughout the 2024 election.</p>
<p>The revelation, first reported by Media Research Center, is concerning given it’s led by a media group known as Free Press, whose co-founder Robert W. McChesney once wrote in 2000, “our job is to make media reform part of our broader struggle for democracy, social justice, and, dare we say it, socialism.”</p>
<p>Free Press, which counts itself among Soros’ major grantees, bills itself as an organization that “closely watches as the decisions shaping the media landscape are made and sounds the alarm when people’s rights to connect and communicate are in danger.” Last month, the group <a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/more-200-groups-urge-leading-tech-platforms-protect-election-integrity">boasted about a letter</a> urging executives at Discord, Google, Instagram, Meta, Pinterest, Reddit, Rumble, Snap, TikTok, Twitch, Twitter and YouTube to keep online platforms “safe and healthy” in 2024 through six specific “interventions.”</p>
<p>Among the letters demands were the reinstatement of “election-integrity policies,” “swiftly enforc[ing] rules against election lies and hate in political advertising,” “requir[ing] disclosure of AI-generated political content,” “plac[ing] greater friction to reduce the visibility and easy distribution of election-related content that has been flagged and is awaiting review,” “hold[ing] influencer, public figure and political candidate accounts to the same moderation and enforcement standards as everyone else,” and “improv[ing] transparency and enable civil-society oversight of enforcement practices by regularly sharing virality and enforcement reports.”</p>
<p>Among the  “200 civil-society organizations, researchers and journalists” signing the letter, at least 45 of them have had received a whopping $80,757,329 between 2016 and 2022 alone from Soros.</p>
<p>Of all the signatories, climate change-focused Global Witness received a whopping $20,338,270 between 2016 and 2022. The group’s ‘digital threats’ campaign is tasked with pressuring governments to regulate speech on social media.</p>
<p>The MRC also found that the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, another signee, received over $3 million from Soros between 2017 and 2022.</p>
<p>The left-wing group was recently exposed by congressional investigators for co-authoring a ‘hate groups’ blacklist with the controversial, Soros-funded Global Disinformation Index (GDI) that targeted ‘conservative’ and faith-based organizations.</p>
