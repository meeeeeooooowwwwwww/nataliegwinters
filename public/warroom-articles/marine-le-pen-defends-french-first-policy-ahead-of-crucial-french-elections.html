<p>Marine Le Pen, a Populist, continues to attract intense media attention ahead of important Sunday elections in France. On Friday, Le Pen sat down with CNN for an interview with Christiane Amanpour and talked about what the media reported on her controversial "National Preference” policy that her National Rally party hopes to enforce if they win the French elections.</p>
<p>Le Pen argues that her approach to immigration is about nationality, not origin. She aims to grant French citizens extra rights, which contrasts with the rights of immigrants.</p>
<p>Nationalism remains a pivotal issue in elections worldwide, particularly in nations where massive immigration has raised significant concerns, including in France. CNN’s focus on French nationality in their Friday interview indicates the broader debate over national identity, social cohesion, and the rights of immigrants versus those of native-born citizens. As Le Pen signals, this discussion highlights the tensions and policy challenges in societies grappling with integrating diverse populations while maintaining national priorities.</p>

<div>From the CNN interview<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/it-s-not-about-origin-marine-le-pen-defends-controversial-national-preference-policy/vi-BB1pu1aU?ocid=socialshare"> clip (Link)</a>:</div>

<p><strong>Christiane Amanpour:</strong> This concept that you have of national preference. It’s said that you and Mr. Bardella mentioned to the FT that to have France for the French, housing, certain jobs, and certain social assistance would be a matter of origin. As you said, it would go to French people. How does that work? And is that even constitutional? Can you distinguish between the public assistance given to French-born citizens versus those who are immigrants, who also pay taxes and social security, etc.?</p>
<p><strong>Marine Le Pen:</strong> First of all, it’s not a national preference; it’s a national priority. So, it is exercised in several areas. Firstly, in social housing, for example. The idea is very simple. We’re going to house people in social housing that has been paid for by the French, their parents, and their grandparents over the generations. We’re going to give priority to those who have French nationality, whatever their origin. It’s about French nationals.</p>
<p>When French people meet the criteria and are prioritized, the remaining social housing units can be allocated to foreigners. If you like, the principle is clear. When it comes to contributive benefits, i.e., those that foreigners pay contributions towards, we won’t touch them. It’s a topic we’ve already tackled since during the 2022 campaign, we specifically said we wanted to be able to change the Constitution to allow French citizens to be granted extra rights attached to their nationality, beyond those granted to foreigners.</p>
<p>The French already have a right that foreigners do not—it’s the right to vote. It’s not about origin or anything else; it’s just a question of nationality, of belonging to a country, and citizenship. Why? Because foreigners who are present in our country, and whom we respect, are perfectly able to stay here if they work and respect the laws, etc. The fact remains that they are in France but have another country, while the French only have one.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THE MEDIA IS REPORTING</strong></p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also faces a pivotal moment as the second round of legislative elections unfolds. With his centrist bloc finishing third in the first round, behind the far right, Macron’s influence on defense and foreign affairs could be significantly diminished, according to AP reporting on Saturday. Analysts and retired military officers suggest that the election results may impact Macron’s role as a prominent European figure and Ukraine supporter against Russia.</p>
<p>Media reports say Macron’s camp is unlikely to secure an absolute majority, having already lost many candidates. According to French media, the likely outcomes are either a fragmented parliament with a weak prime minister or, worse for Macron, a victory for the far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen’s protégé, Jordan Bardella. Bardella, as prime minister, would challenge Macron’s defense and foreign policy powers, particularly regarding Ukraine.</p>
<p>The French Constitution provides limited guidance on resolving potential conflicts between the president and the prime minister. Bardella has set “red lines” against sending long-range weaponry to Ukraine and deploying troops, fearing a nuclear confrontation with Russia. This stance contrasts with Macron’s more proactive military approach.</p>
<p>Power-sharing could lead to a political deadlock, with the president and prime minister potentially blocking each other’s actions. This scenario poses challenges for the French military, which operates globally. Analysts express concerns about maintaining France’s commitments to its international allies under such divided leadership.</p>
<p>The media is reporting that a coalition government may be necessary if no clear majority emerges. This would require consensus-building and potentially delay critical foreign policy decisions. This new arrangement would constrain Macron’s control, marking a shift from France’s traditionally solid presidential system.</p>
