<p>Bradley Thayer and CPT James Fanell the co-authors of Embracing Communist China: America’s Greatest Strategic Failure join Steve Bannon’s WarRoom to discuss The U.S. foreign policy community being divided into three schools of thought regarding relations with China.</p>
<p>The first group is the Engagement School. This school believes in cooperating with China, viewing it as a non-threat. They argue for closer ties between the U.S. and China, often prioritizing economic interests over strategic concerns. Despite criticism and evidence of failure, the school remains dominant, supported by influential figures in business, media, and government.</p>
<p>The second is called the Defeatist School. This school contends that the U.S. is too weak to confront China and should avoid direct conflict. They warn against underestimating China’s power and advocate for disengagement to prevent a potentially devastating war. Many members of this school were previously part of the Engagement School but have shifted their stance due to concerns about China’s growing strength.</p>
<p>Finally, the pair discuss Victory School. This school advocates for the total defeat of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its replacement by a government chosen by the Chinese people. They view the CCP as illegitimate and advocate for political, economic, and military measures to undermine its rule. Despite having minimal support, this school believes in the possibility of defeating the CCP and restoring freedom in China.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Thayer and CPT Fanell conclude the choice between these schools will determine whether the 21st century is defined by CCP tyranny or a resurgence of freedom led by the U.S.</p>
