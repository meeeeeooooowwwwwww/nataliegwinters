<h2>DEFCON ONE: Economic Warfare with China</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Major Sea Change on CNN: Bannon Declares “We Own the High Ground”</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>Media Forced to Defend CCP</h3>
<p><strong>Bannon blasted legacy media for defending globalist interests. "We’ve backed them into a corner. They’re now defending a system that’s failed American workers,” he said. The shift, he argued, exposes Wall Street’s exploitation of vulnerable U.S. workers to drive down wages.</strong></p>

<h3>Kevin O’Leary Sparks Debate on CNN</h3>
<p>Kevin O’Leary, sometimes called Mr. Wonderful, is a Canadian politician, businessman, investor, journalist, author, and television personality,  ignited a firestorm on CNN, calling for "DEFCON ONE” economic measures against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Target parts of their economy where there’s a lot of workers,” O’Leary stated, proposing tariffs that hit sectors like yoga mat production to provoke domestic unrest in China. He added, "We’ve had strategies since ‘99. Enough is enough.”</p>

<h3>Bannon Celebrates Media Shift</h3>
<p>On Wednesday ,host  Steve Bannon seized on O’Leary’s remarks during <em>WarRoom</em>, declaring a "major sea change” in public discourse. "For the first time since 2015, it wasn’t just unchained hatred. It was sophisticated policy discussion,” Bannon noted, highlighting a rare focus on tariffs, trade, and economics across mainstream outlets like MSNBC and CNN.</p>
<h3>Tariffs as a Blunt Tool</h3>
<p>Recalling Trump-era tariffs, Bannon emphasized their impact: "When President Trump said, ‘I’ve had it with fentanyl and 70,000 deaths,’ Mexico and China got the message. Tariffs are a blunt tool, but they work.”</p>
<h3>High-Stakes Economic Warfare</h3>
<p>Bannon hailed O’Leary’s bold stance as a call to action. "Kevin O’Leary gets it. Put 25% tariffs on the CCP now, and you’ll break their economy,” he urged. According to Bannon, such measures would boost wages for American workers while pressuring China’s regime.</p>
<h3>The Moral High Ground</h3>
<p>Declaring victory in the battle of ideas, Bannon said, "We own the moral high ground. This is about bringing back jobs and defending our citizens. They’re just stooges for corporate oligarchs.”</p>
<p>As Bannon frames it, the fight against the CCP is economic and moral, signaling a pivotal shift in U.S. policy and public opinion. “DEFCON ONE starts now,” he declared.</p>
<h3>Expanding Economic Patriotism: A Movement Gains Momentum</h3>
<p>Bannon doubled down on the necessity of economic nationalism, stressing that tariffs are only the beginning. “This isn’t just about balancing trade deficits,” he said. “It’s about dismantling a system that prioritizes corporate profits over American livelihoods.” Bannon’s vision ties into broader efforts to revitalize domestic manufacturing and rebuild working-class communities.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the role of accountability in this economic war. “China’s economy is teetering because of their overreliance on exploitative practices. A trillion dollars injected into local economies won’t solve their problems if the global tide shifts against them.” Bannon’s strategy mirrors the boldness of Trump-era policies that leveraged economic tools to reassert America’s dominance.</p>
<h3>Global Implications: Allies and Adversaries React</h3>
<p>The tariffs debate isn’t limited to the U.S.-China axis. Bannon emphasized the need for cooperation with Mexico and Canada, particularly under the USMCA. “Trump showed what’s possible with pressure and negotiation. We need to replicate that success.” He also warned against appeasement strategies by European allies, arguing that a unified Western front is essential to counter China’s influence.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This is the new 1932 moment,” he said, referencing the Great Depression’s impact on global economic realignments. “It’s not just policy—it’s survival.”</strong></p></blockquote>
