<h4>Defending American Democracy</h4>
<p>Mike Davis appeared on Bannon’s WarRoom on Monday to discuss his support of the SAVE Act, which seeks to safeguard American elections by mandating proof of citizenship for voter registration. As illegal voting remains a contentious issue, organizations like the Article III Project are actively campaigning to raise awareness about the serious consequences of illegal voting through targeted advertisements. With a potential 20 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. and allegations of widespread non-citizen voting, the urgency for legislative action is paramount, according to Davis.</p>
<p>The integrity of U.S. elections is under scrutiny, and Davis, a prominent legal advocate and founder of the Article III Project, is at the forefront of the fight for election integrity. On Monday, Davis discussed the implications of the SAVE Act, which requires proof of citizenship to register to vote. <strong>He stated, “It is illegal to vote in federal elections if you are a non-citizen; it is almost always a federal crime.” </strong></p>
<p>This crucial legislation ensures that only eligible voters participate in the electoral process, thereby preserving the sanctity of American democracy.</p>
<h4>We Know Non-Citizens are Voting</h4>
<p>Davis’s comments come from alarming reports highlighting non-citizen voting in key states. He pointed out that recent findings from Virginia and Texas revealed that thousands of non-citizens had been found on voter rolls, raising serious questions about the electoral process. He explained, “Governor Glenn Youngkin has discovered 6,000 non-citizens voting illegally in Virginia, while Governor Greg Abbott has identified 2,000 non-citizens in Texas. This is not just a coincidence; it’s a trend we need to address.”</p>
<h4>Article Three Project’s Ad for Spanish-Speaking Potential Voters</h4>
<p>To combat the threat of illegal voting, the Article III Project has launched a nationwide advertising campaign to educate the public about the potential consequences of participating in elections as a non-citizen. Davis noted the significance of these ads, stating, “We have put out a 30-second public service announcement in Spanish to convey the message that it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections.” This strategic move aims to reach both English and Spanish-speaking audiences, ensuring that the message resonates with a broader demographic.</p>
<p>The ad campaign serves not only to inform but also to deter non-citizens from voting. Davis elaborated, “We want to make it clear that illegal voting can lead to serious repercussions, including deportation.” By raising awareness about the legal ramifications of illegal voting, the Article III Project seeks to dissuade non-citizens from participating in the electoral process and encourage compliance with existing laws.</p>
<p>Davis also highlighted the resistance faced by the SAVE Act from Democratic lawmakers. He stated, "The Democrats argue that we don’t need the SAVE Act because it’s already illegal for non-citizens to vote. Yet, they continue to ignore the evidence that non-citizens are voting.” This statement underscores the ongoing partisan divide regarding election integrity and the necessity for stricter measures to prevent illegal voting.</p>
<h4>Urgent Call to Action</h4>
<p>The broader context of immigration policy and voting rights amplifies the urgency for the SAVE Act. With millions of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, ensuring that only citizens can vote has become a pressing issue. Davis articulated the stakes, saying, “With the Biden administration allowing nearly 20 million illegal immigrants into the country, the risk of compromised elections grows by the day.” He stressed that maintaining election integrity is vital for democracy, particularly as swing states become battlegrounds for both political parties.</p>
<p>In light of these challenges, Davis urged Americans to take action. He encouraged viewers to visit the Article III Project’s website to find resources to get involved in advocacy efforts for the SAVE Act and election integrity initiatives. “You can take action to ensure that our next election is not rigged and stolen. Every American should be concerned about this issue,” he asserted.</p>
<h4>Illegals Could Sway the Election</h4>
<p>As the 2024 elections approach, the conversation surrounding illegal voting and election integrity is more critical than ever. The SAVE Act represents a proactive step towards ensuring that U.S. elections are fair, transparent, and secure. By educating the public through strategic campaigns and advocating for necessary legislation, advocates like Mike Davis are fighting to protect democracy and uphold the rule of law.</p>
