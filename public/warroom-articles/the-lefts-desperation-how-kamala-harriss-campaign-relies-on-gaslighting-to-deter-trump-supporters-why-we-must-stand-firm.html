<p>In a powerful analysis on Friday’s WarRoom, Monica Crowley exposed a key strategy of the Kamala Harris campaign and the broader Democratic movement: gaslighting and demoralizing Trump supporters.</p>
<h4>THEY ARE GASLIGHTING US</h4>
<p>According to Crowley, this pattern of behavior has been a cornerstone of the Democratic playbook for years, as they attempt to degrade and dismiss the values and beliefs of the America First movement. However, rather than succumbing to fear or despair, Crowley urges Trump supporters to remain active, engaged, and resolute as the 2024 election approaches.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Crowley points to the media’s deliberate attempts to frame Trump supporters and the America First movement as "despicable,” echoing past Democratic rhetoric. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>She recalls Barack Obama’s infamous remark that Americans "cling to their guns and religion” and Hillary Clinton’s characterization of Trump supporters as a "basket of deplorables.” Today, she argues, the media and the left continue this tradition, "spewing their propaganda” in an attempt to discredit anyone who dares to challenge the status quo.</p>
<h4>THAT IS ALL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LEFT</h4>
<p>Crowley explains that while these attacks are "infuriating and incredibly insulting,” they also reveal the true disdain that the left harbors for traditional American values. "They have contempt for the country, for the Declaration, for the Constitution, for free-market capitalism,” she says, adding that those who stand up for these principles are seen as enemies by the political elite. As the stakes of the upcoming election rise, Crowley suggests, the left’s contempt is becoming more transparent, as they can no longer hide their disdain for those who challenge their power.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign, in Crowley’s view, has been left with little more than gaslighting as a strategy. With their policies failing and their credibility in question, Crowley believes that the left’s focus has shifted to discouraging and demoralizing Trump supporters. By portraying the movement as extreme, dangerous, or irrelevant, they hope to sap the energy of Trump’s base and diminish its ability to mobilize ahead of the election. "They are elitist snobs,” Crowley declares, emphasizing the growing desperation on the left.</p>
<h4>STAND FIRM – DO NOT GIVE UP</h4>
<p>But Crowley’s message is not one of defeat—far from it. She believes that now, more than ever, Trump supporters must take action to ensure their voices are heard. "We need the army of the awakened,” she proclaims, calling for widespread grassroots efforts to counter the left’s attempts to suppress voter enthusiasm. Rather than retreat in the face of relentless media attacks and gaslighting, Crowley urges her audience to become even more involved, especially through initiatives like "Trump Force 47” and election integrity efforts.</p>
<p>"They could now do a bait-and-switch,” Crowley warns, noting the increasingly "desperate” moves by Kamala Harris and the Democratic establishment. She stresses the importance of recognizing the danger of this political moment, but also emphasizes the power that lies in staying engaged. "We have 53 days to go,” she reminds supporters, encouraging them to remain focused, not fearful.</p>
<h4>GET INVOLVED NOW</h4>
<p>Ultimately, Crowley’s message is one of empowerment. Despite the left’s best efforts to discourage, dismiss, and gaslight, she believes that the America First movement is stronger than ever. Crowley insists that the media’s attacks are a sign of weakness, not strength, on the part of the Democrats, and that Trump’s supporters must seize this opportunity to fight back. "A desperate system is an increasingly dangerous system,” she concludes, but with action, determination, and unity, the movement can overcome these challenges.</p>
<p>As Crowley reminds us, the key to victory lies in refusing to sink into panic or fear and staying active in the fight for America’s future.</p>
