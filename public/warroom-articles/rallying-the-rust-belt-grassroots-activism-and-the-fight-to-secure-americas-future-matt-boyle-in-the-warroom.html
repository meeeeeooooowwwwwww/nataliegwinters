<p>Alex DeGrasse, host of the WarRoom, and Matt Boyle had a lengthy and robust conversation on Thursday’s WarRoom program; they focused on the critical role of grassroots activism and the importance of informed voting in the upcoming elections. Boyle, a seasoned political analyst during his time at Breitbart News as their political Editor, brought his deep knowledge of the political landscape to the discussion, emphasizing the significance of white working-class voters and the ongoing efforts by the Republican Party to mobilize them, particularly in the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Boyle opened by challenging the mainstream media narrative that the election is a sure win for Kamala Harris and the Democrats.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The established media would like everybody to believe that this election is in the bag for the Democrats, and that it’s over for Trump,” he stated. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>However, Boyle emphasized that data from various polls and voter registration numbers paint a different picture, one much more favorable to Republicans. For instance, a recent AARP poll showed Donald Trump leading in Michigan, a crucial battleground state.</p>
<p>Boyle highlighted the importance of white working-class voters, asserting that “the entire election will be decided by white working-class voters.” These voters, historically a stronghold for Trump, are seen as the key to securing victory in 2024. Voter registration data in Rust Belt states shows a significant shift away from Democrats and toward Republicans since the 2020 election, with Pennsylvania seeing a net swing of over 300,000 votes.</p>
<p>Boyle also pointed out the efforts by grassroots organizations like Scott Pressler’s and Turning Point Action to register new voters and flip registrations in working-class areas. These efforts target low-propensity voters who might not otherwise turn out on election day. “If our people get out to vote, we will swamp them out,” Boyle emphasized, stressing the importance of voter turnout in securing a Republican victory.</p>
<p>DeGrasse echoed Boyle’s sentiments, urging grassroots activists to focus on voter registration and participate in the election process. He encouraged people in battleground states to become “Trump Force Captains,” a role that involves mobilizing and turning out voters. DeGrasse also emphasized the importance of becoming poll watchers on election day to ensure the integrity of the vote.</p>
<p>Boyle also addressed the issue of suppression polls, describing them as efforts by the media to demoralize Republican voters. “There’s a lot of misinformation and disinformation by the established media,” Boyle said. He advised voters to look beyond the headlines and dig deeper into the data to get a clearer picture of where the race truly stands.</p>
<p>A key difference between the 2016 and 2024 elections, Boyle noted, is the preparedness of the Republican side. In 2016, many in Washington, D.C., did not expect Donald Trump to win, leading to a lack of a coordinated agenda. This time, things are different. “We have a great plan,” Boyle said, referring to President Trump’s agenda for his potential second term. "The 20-point plan…we’re working to put that into a legislative reality very quickly.”</p>
<p>The plan is well-organized, with Trump’s team and allies in the House and Senate meticulously planning for the first days, weeks, and months of the new administration. "It’s going to take all of us to get out to vote, get your friends, get involved, get active on social media,” Boyle urged. The message was clear: everyone has a role to play in securing victory.</p>
<p>DeGrasse didn’t shy away from acknowledging the uphill battle that lies ahead. "This is not going to be easy for us,” he admitted, but emphasized the need to stay on the offensive. "If we can execute, execute, execute…offense, offense, offense,” he reiterated, the path to victory is achievable.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the importance of House and Senate races, noting that expanding the Republican majority in the House by even five to ten seats would give Trump the breathing room needed to get his agenda through Congress.</p>
<p>The conversation between DeGrasse and Boyle is a powerful reminder of the importance of grassroots activism and informed voting in the upcoming elections. Boyle’s message was clear: the election will be won or lost based on the efforts of everyday Americans, particularly those in the Rust Belt, to get out and vote.</p>
<p>Every effort counts in the fight for a brighter future.</p>
