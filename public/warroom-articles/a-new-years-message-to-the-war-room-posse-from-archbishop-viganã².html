<p>Dear War Room Posse: As we confront the beginning of the Year of our Lord 2023, the present situation, both in the United States and in Europe, is truly worrying. The globalist elite is continuing to implement its infernal agenda, both with the crisis in Ukraine and with new emergencies aimed at controlling the world population and destroying the religious, social and economic fabric of Nations.</p>
<p>In this desolate panorama, even the hierarchy of the Catholic Church is almost totally subservient to the interests of the deep state, which finds a zealous ally in the deep church rather than, as it would be right, a firm opponent.</p>
<p>It is heartening to see that there are so many good souls, both in civil society and in the Church, who are not deceived by the official narrative and know how to recognize the grave impending threat. Some are committed to denouncing the global coup, and among these Steve Bannon and his War Room stand out â€" as well as the "War Room Posse" which sees it as a safe reference point for understanding what is happening.</p>
<p>To all of you, and to all those who are engaged in this work of information and geopolitical analysis in the light of the Christian faith, I assure you of my remembrance in prayer, urging you all to keep yourselves in the Grace of God, the only salvation in this hour of darkness. If you fight this good fight under the banner of Christ the King, He will protect you and make the Enemy's assaults useless.</p>
<p>Draw strength in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the armor of God, to be able to resist the snares of the devil. Indeed, our battle is not against creatures made of blood and flesh, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of this world of darkness, against the spirits of evil who dwell in the heavenly regions (Eph 6:10-12).</p>
<p>May the Lord bless you all.</p>
<p><em>—Carlo Maria ViganÃ², Archbishop</em>
<em>6 January Solemnity of the Epiphany</em></p>
