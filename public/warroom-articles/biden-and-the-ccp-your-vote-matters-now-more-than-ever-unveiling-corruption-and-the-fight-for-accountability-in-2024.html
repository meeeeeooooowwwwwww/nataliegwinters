<p>On Tuesday’s WarRoom, former Congressman Dave Brat and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) discussed the explosive findings from the Comer Committee, which revealed troubling details about the Biden family’s financial entanglements with foreign entities.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Brat emphasized the importance of voter turnout for November’s elections, stating, “It is incumbent upon us to give hope to people, to get them to go and vote.” He stressed that the future of the Republic hinges on the electorate’s response to these issues.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion focused on how Joe Biden allegedly traded on his name and influence for financial gain during his time as vice president and beyond, raising serious questions about corruption at the highest levels of government.</p>
<p>According to Biggs, the report shows that the Biden family received substantial payouts from multiple countries, including China and Russia.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> “For literally years, Joe Biden, when he was Vice President, between offices, and even as President, his family was trading on his name and access,” Biggs explained. “The money was flowing to the Bidens, and they were just selling a brand. They had no services. Joe Biden was the brand. The Joe Biden lift. They were selling Joe Biden, and that is corruption.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Biggs highlighted specific instances, such as payments from the former mayor of Moscow’s wife, one of the richest women in Russia, who funneled millions to the Bidens. These payments were allegedly facilitated by Joe Biden himself, who participated in meetings and phone calls with these foreign actors, thereby closing the deals. The report suggests that this pattern was repeated with other countries, including China, where Hunter Biden reportedly secured over a billion dollars to manage after traveling there with his father on Air Force Two.</p>
<p>The discussion also turned to the implications of these revelations for the upcoming 2024 election and the need for accountability.</p>
<p>Biggs expressed frustration over the lack of consequences for the Biden family, noting that while impeachment articles have been filed by various Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, there isn’t enough support within Congress to move forward decisively. “I want to give hope and truth,” Biggs said. “When we get back in, we will need to get the real impeachment trial against Joe Biden.” However, he also voiced a concern, adding, “I am worried that they are going to say that we don’t have the time, so we need more conservatives because we do not have the votes right now.”</p>
<p>Brat echoed this sentiment, pointing to the need for more conservative representation in Washington to ensure that the necessary steps can be taken. “Even after finding $30 million, we don’t have the votes right now. We need more conservatives in D.C.,” he said.</p>
<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Brat and Biggs have stressed the importance of the America First movement, urging voters to stay informed, engaged, and ready to take action at the ballot box.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The stakes have never been higher,” Brat concluded, “and it’s up to us to make sure our voices are heard and our Republic is preserved.”</strong></p></blockquote>
