<p>Joe Biden appointed Linda Darling-Hammond, who has praised China's pro-communist education system for doing "magical work," to a Department of Education advisory board.</p>
<p>Amidst controversy over the left's politicization of school curriculum and sexualization of children, Biden appointed Hammond to the National Board for Education Sciences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/27/president-biden-announces-key-appointments-to-boards-and-commissions-12/">board</a> advises the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), which is <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/aboutus/">described</a> as the "statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the U.S. Department of Education."</p>
<p>Hammond, as <a href="https://freebeacon.com/campus/biden-education-lead-chinese-communist-party-has-done-magical-work/amp/">reported</a> by The Free Beacon, praised the Chinese Communist Party’s education system for its “magical work” in setting up a strong teacher-government presence in student life.</p>
<p>In her 2017 book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empowered-Educators-High-Performing-Systems-Teaching/dp/1119369606/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Empowered+Educators%3A+How+High-Performing+Systems+Shape+Teaching+Quality+Around+the+World&amp;qid=1606704360&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Empowered Educators: How High-Performing Systems Shape Teaching Quality Around the World</a></em>, she explained how the regime's teachers play a large role in Chinese students' lives.</p>
<p>“Teachers in China are revered as elders, role models, and those whom parents entrust to shape the future of their children,” Darling-Hammond wrote. “In the Tao traditions of ritual, the phrase 'heaven-earth-sovereign-parent-teacher’ is repeated and becomes ingrained in how people see themselves holistically governed and supported.”</p>
<p>The country’s school system, however, is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-education/chinas-xi-calls-for-universities-allegiance-to-the-communist-party-idUSKBN13Y0B5">sends </a>inspectors to monitor teachers for “improper” remarks to ensure that schools function as a training ground for socialist values.</p>
<p>Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-education/chinas-xi-calls-for-universities-allegiance-to-the-communist-party-idUSKBN13Y0B5">said</a> that China’s schools and teachers must “serve the Communist Party in its management of the country.”</p>
<p>Hammond has also praised China's school system in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/darling-hammond-us-vs-highest-achieving-nations-in-education/2011/03/22/ABkNeaCB_blog.html">articles</a> for <em>The Washington Post, </em>where she celebrated the regime for reportedly investing in teacher development.</p>
