<h4>Election officials and mainstream media outlets are warning of potential delays in election results due to the use of mail-in ballots in the upcoming midterms.</h4>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Acting Secretary of State Leigh M. Chapman, for example, held a press conference to announce how it would likely take <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-10-25/pa-s-acting-secretary-of-state-warns-of-possible-delays-in-election-results">“several days until results are complete and certified.”</a></p>
<div>
<p>"It's going to take a few days (to count all mail-in votes)," acting Secretary of the Commonwealth Leigh Chapman said.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean anything bad is happening. It just means the election process is playing out (and) every vote is being counted,” she <a href="https://observer-reporter.com/news/localnews/mail-in-ballots-expected-to-delay-pa-election-results/article_1d7d99cc-53d5-11ed-9da7-cf55e91de5af.html">claimed</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>ABC News ran a story <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/late-start-counting-midterm-mail-votes-means-wait/story?id=91344266">titled</a> “Why Pennsylvania may not have election night results and why that’s OK,” attempting to normalize a delay in election results.</div>
<div>Officials from other <a href="https://www.abc12.com/news/local/heavy-absentee-voting-could-delay-results-in-michigan-on-election-night/article_d6db1a6e-5184-11ed-b1cb-b7f8fb38c213.html">states</a>, such as Michigan, have also warned about a delay in election results due to mail-in ballots.</div>
<div>Jake Rollow, a spokesman for the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office, asserted <span>“the end of vote counting probably won’t be done until about 24 hours after the polls close.” </span></div>
<div>The narrative is strikingly similar to <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2020/11/02/hawkfish-social-media-campaign/">claims</a> made during the 2020 election by Democratic activists and officials, who attempted to mainstream the fact that results from election night would take longer to materialize than in previous elections.</div>
<div>Reports on the 2020 election have demonstrated how late-night ballot <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/01/04/suspicious-biden-ballot-dumps/">“dumps,”</a> comprised of mail-in ballots, were all in <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/01/04/suspicious-biden-ballot-dumps/">favor</a> of Joe Biden.</div>
