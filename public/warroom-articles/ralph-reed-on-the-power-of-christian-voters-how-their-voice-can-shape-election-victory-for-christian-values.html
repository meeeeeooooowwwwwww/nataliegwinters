<p>On Tuesday, Dave Brat and Ralph Reed did their best to reach Christian voters, who could play an essential role in the upcoming election. They stressed that their involvement could decisively alter the political landscape. With a focus on mobilizing the faith community, Reed and Brat highlighted the stark contrast between the candidates on moral and freedom issues, urging Christians to leverage their collective power to effect change.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Reed emphasized the gravity of the election, noting, "I can’t recall an election where the gap and the chasm separating the two major party nominees on the moral issues that burn in the hearts and give meaning to the souls of tens of millions of Americans are in sharper contrast.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The statistics are compelling. Reed highlighted that the number of Evangelical Christians voting increased from 24 million in 2016 to 35 million in 2020, a testament to the impact of grassroots mobilization.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> "We’re projecting we can add another 10 to 12 million Evangelical voters this time,” Reed asserted. He encouraged every Christian to contribute to this effort, whether by canvassing, making phone calls, or spreading the word.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He praised former President Donald Trump for his unwavering pro-life stance, judicial appointments, and advocacy for religious freedom, citing his pivotal role in appointing three Supreme Court justices who upheld religious liberty in landmark cases.</p>
<p>Conversely, Reed criticized Kamala Harris, describing her as "the most liberal, San Francisco, left-wing radical nominee ever put forward by a major party,” with little regard for the Judeo-Christian values that many Americans hold dear. He pointed out her and her running mate’s past actions against religious freedoms, like their support for restricting church gatherings during the pandemic. "The fact that they thought it was more important to open stores than churches tells you all you need to know about this ticket,” Reed remarked, highlighting a fundamental difference in how each candidate views religious freedom.</p>
<p>Brat and Reed’s discussion took a motivational turn as Reed detailed the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s ambitious plan to mobilize voters. "We will knock on 10 million doors and reach 17 to 18 million Evangelical and pro-life Roman Catholic voters at their homes between now and November 5th,” Reed announced. This massive outreach effort aims to engage voters directly, emphasizing personal connections over impersonal digital campaigns.</p>
<p>Reed urged Christians to move beyond passive support and actively participate in the election process. "We have to put feet to our prayers,” he said. "We can’t just yell at the television set. We’ve got to go out and knock on doors, call voters, and educate them on the issues.” He stressed that grassroots efforts, rather than media narratives or poll predictions, will be crucial in determining the election’s outcome.</p>
<p>As Reed concluded, "The polls are irrelevant. The pundits are irrelevant. The press is irrelevant. It’s all about the grassroots.” He called on all Americans who value freedom and constitutional principles to unite in this pivotal election, underscoring that their combined efforts can indeed change the course of history.</p>
<p>With the power of the Christian vote and grassroots activism, this election can be a defining moment for the nation’s future. It’s time to step up, make your voice heard, and be a part of the movement that shapes the direction of our country.</p>
