<p>Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist and close ally of President Donald Trump, is facing serious charges in New York over his involvement in the “We Build the Wall” campaign. However, despite the weight of the allegations, Bannon remains defiant and unapologetic, vowing to continue his fight against what he describes as a politically motivated attack on his character and mission.</p>
<p>One woman close to the story, who was involved with the project, posted on social media a statement in support of Bannon on Tuesday:</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Bannon appeared in a New York courtroom as Judge April Newbauer declined to delay his upcoming trial, which is set for December 9. Bannon is charged with defrauding supporters who donated to the online campaign aimed at funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Prosecutors claim that some of the $15 million raised was diverted for personal use by Bannon and the campaign’s president, Brian Kolfage.</p>
<p>According to ABC News, while the defense team sought to delay the trial until January to address new evidence presented by the prosecution, the judge did not grant the request. However, Newbauer left open the possibility of adjusting the trial schedule after a hearing next Monday. The prosecution asserts that the evidence will not lengthen the trial, which is expected to last about a week.</p>
<p>Bannon’s legal team, led by defense attorney John Carman, has pushed back strongly, arguing that they need more time to properly counter the new evidence. Carman also suggested that Bannon’s co-defendants in a related federal case could be called to testify in his defense, possibly shedding new light on the case.</p>
<p>ABC News reported that for his part, Bannon has consistently denied the charges and maintains that the funds he received from the “We Build the Wall” campaign were for legitimate expenses. “The money that he was taking was money he was entitled to take,” Carman argued in court, emphasizing Bannon’s belief that he was reimbursed for his work in the campaign.</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, Bannon clarified that he sees this legal battle as part of a broader political struggle. As he walked from the courthouse, Bannon took a moment to address reporters and denounce what he called “lawfare” – the weaponization of the legal system for political gain. "The people rendered their verdict on this lawfare last Tuesday,” he said, referring to the outcome of the recent election. "The hunted are about to become the hunters.”</p>
<p>Bannon’s comments highlighted his belief that the American people have already spoken out against the political establishment and its ongoing attacks on him and others aligned with the populist-nationalist movement. "Working-class people, all over the country, came together and rejected what’s going on in this court,” he continued. "The lawfare of Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Jack Smith, and Merrick Garland has been rejected by a landslide by the American people.”</p>
<p>Bannon’s defiance is not new. He has faced significant legal challenges in recent years, including a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with a subpoena related to the January 6th Capitol attack. Despite these setbacks, Bannon remains steadfast in his commitment to the causes he champions, including the “America First” agenda and a fight against what he perceives as a corrupt political system.</p>
<p>Bannon’s trial is set to be a pivotal moment in his ongoing battle with the legal system. While the outcome remains uncertain, it’s clear that Bannon intends to fight back with all the political capital and public support he can muster.</p>
