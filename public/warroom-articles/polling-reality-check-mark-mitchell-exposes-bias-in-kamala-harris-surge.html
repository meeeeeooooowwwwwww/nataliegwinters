<p>On Thursday’s WarRoom interview, Dave Brat and Mark Mitchell dove deep into the current state of political polling, exposing suspicious trends and raising questions about the media’s role in shaping public perception. Mitchell, representing Rasmussen Reports, provided a critical analysis of the polling industry’s behavior, particularly regarding the unexpected surge in Kamala Harris’s numbers.</p>
<p>Mitchell expressed concerns about the polling industry’s lack of transparency. He highlighted discrepancies in polls that seem to favor Harris and called out major polling organizations for being extensions of the mainstream media, which he believes is part of the state apparatus.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The new cycle seemed so starved of material that it allows things like New York Times Sienna to drop a very selected and limited set of three swing States that happened to be Donald Trump’s worst swing States into last Sunday’s news cycle,” Mitchell said, pointing to the selective nature of polling data presented to the public.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Diving into the numbers, Mitchell revealed some stark contrasts between the candidates. For example, when asked if Kamala Harris’s economic policies would be better or worse than Biden’s, only 22% believed they would be better, while 38% thought they would be worse. In contrast, 51% said Trump’s policies would be better than Biden’s, with 38% saying worse.</p>
<p>This shows a significant advantage for Trump regarding economic issues, which are the number one concern for voters.</p>
<p>During the segment, Mitchell began by addressing the general reliability of polls, noting that they tend to become more accurate as elections near.</p>
<p>However, he cautions that recent data shifts seem questionable, especially regarding Kamala Harris’s sudden rise in the polls.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Kamala Harris in the real clear politics aggregate is now up by almost one point,” Mitchell stated, emphasizing that this shift doesn’t align with the underlying fundamentals favoring Trump, where the Democrat candidate is often seen as “incompetent or mentally incompetent.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He explained to Brat that one of his primary concerns is the significant drop in polling activity over the last month. He points out that in the first 13 days of August, there were only 28 state polls, compared to 73 over the previous 13 days of July. This sudden decrease in polling, according to Mitchell, raises suspicions. He suggests that many polling organizations may have stopped after capturing a favorable “Kamala bounce,” which they could use to influence the narrative. “It looks like they went into the field, got a positive Kam Bounce, and then said, ‘Hey, why do we need to poll again?’” Mitchell speculates, adding that this is a sign of the industry “carrying water for the Democrats.”</p>
<p>Mitchell also addressed Harris’s poor performance on the border issue, noting that she “hit incredibly bad marks on her job as the borders are.”</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Trump holds a “lower double-digit lead” over Harris regarding the Middle East, a critical issue as tensions rise globally. Mitchell argues that the Democrats’ campaign lacks substance, noting that they haven’t even put out agenda points yet, which will make it difficult for them to sustain their current momentum. “They are not going to be able to carry out this media sugar high all the way to November,” he warns.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s analysis raises serious concerns about the integrity of the polling industry and its influence on public perception. With Trump holding strong leads on critical issues like the economy and foreign policy, Mitchell questions whether Harris’s recent polling surge is legitimate or simply a manufactured narrative designed to boost the Democrats’ chances.</p>
