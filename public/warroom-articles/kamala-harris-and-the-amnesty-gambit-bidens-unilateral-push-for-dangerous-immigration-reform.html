<p>Kamala Harris’s role in the Biden administration’s immigration policy has recently come under intense scrutiny as her office spearheads an ambitious and controversial amnesty initiative. This new push, revealed on Thursday’s WarRoom program by Rosemary Jenks of the Immigration Accountability Project, exposes a dangerous shift in strategy by the Democrats, aiming to bypass Congress in favor of unilateral action on immigration.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jenks describes this move as an unprecedented reward for illegal behavior, asserting, "The longer you have successfully broken our laws, the more you’re going to be rewarded for it.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Jenks told show host Dave Brat that starting August 19th, the Biden administration plans to accept applications for amnesty from illegal aliens who have been in the U.S. for over ten years and are married to U.S. citizens. She said the policy will also extend to those who have graduated from U.S. colleges.</p>
<p>This initiative mirrors the controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program implemented by the Obama administration in 2012, which was also criticized for its executive overreach.</p>
<p>The details surrounding the new amnesty program remain sparse, with critical questions about eligibility and the scope of criminal offenses that might be overlooked. Jenks questions whether the administration will disregard illegal voting or false claims of U.S. citizenship as part of the amnesty criteria.</p>
<p>"We don’t know what criminal offenses they’re going to waive,” she warns. This lack of transparency has fueled concerns that the new amnesty program could undermine the rule of law and further complicate immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity is a bipartisan coalition that includes both Democrats and Republicans, notably led by Democrat Tom Suozzi and Republican Morgan Luttrell.</p>
<p>Jenks expresses her dismay at this collaboration with the ultra-left National Immigration Forum, a group she believes is pushing for policies that are out of step with mainstream American values. "It is astonishing that Republican members of Congress would join forces with these left-wing groups to promote bad immigration policy,” Jenks says, highlighting a troubling alignment that could erode conservative resistance to expansive amnesty measures.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s amnesty gambit is part of a broader pattern of executive actions aimed at circumventing legislative gridlock. The administration’s efforts to enact significant immigration reforms through executive orders rather than traditional legislative channels reflect a strategic decision to push forward with policy changes despite the likelihood of congressional opposition.</p>
<p>Jenks’s critique of the administration is grounded in broader concerns about the dangers of such unilateral actions. She points to a grim reality: "Over five and a half million illegal aliens have been released into the U.S., and we have at least 362 people on the terrorist watch list who have tried to enter the country illegally.” These figures illustrate the stakes involved and the potential for increased security risks and societal strain if amnesty measures are not carefully managed.</p>
<p>In response to these developments, Jenks calls for heightened vigilance and action from the public. She urges supporters to visit the <a href="https://iaproject.org/">Immigration Accountability Project</a>’s website for more information and to mobilize against what she sees as a dangerous expansion of amnesty policies. "The destruction to this country is enormous,” Jenks asserts, framing the fight against these policies as crucial for preserving national integrity and security.</p>
<p>As the Biden administration’s amnesty initiatives unfold, the debate over immigration reform remains charged with high stakes and deep divisions.</p>
<p>Harris’s role in advancing these policies and the responses from various political actors will likely continue to shape the national discourse on immigration in the months ahead.</p>
