<p>The advertising landscape for political campaigns is undergoing significant shifts, with streaming services now accepting political ads alongside traditional TV platforms. This change coincides with a surge in campaign spending on TV, including connected TV. Influencer marketing has gained traction, with major players utilizing both paid and unpaid influencers to reach voters online.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The sophistication of the left, they got Silicon Valley, they have the Lords of easy money,” Steve Bannon, host of the WarRoom, said on Wednesday’s morning program, talking about the way the Democrats use technology against Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Political text messaging faces challenges due to declining contact rates, complex carrier policies, oversaturation, and scams. Campaigns are adopting technology earlier in the cycle, according to HGL’s 2022 Election Tech Survey. However, large mergers and acquisitions in key infrastructure raise uncertainties, particularly regarding the future of voter data infrastructure. While tech improves for down-ballot campaigns, many still lack affordable and effective tools despite experiencing electoral success, according to Higher Ground Labs.</p>
<p>Joe Hoft appeared on the WarRoom with Steve Bannon on Wednesday to discuss his findings about the long-time association of interconnected, taxpayer-assisted groups whose mission seems to be the aspiration of the United States of America.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This piece is kind of frightening to tell you the truth. This is a highly organized apparatus to make sure they crush us and they steal elections. They’re not shy about this,” Hoft told Bannon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hoft, in the piece for Gateway Pundit titled, <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2024/05/exclusive-lefts-election-industrial-complex-discovered-defined-inbox/">EXCLUSIVE: The Left’s ELECTION INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX Discovered and Defined, </a>exposed the political technolical industry landscape from 2022.</p>
<p>Hoft and Bannon discussed the current political battle in America, which centers on the clash between what Hoft calls “the Left’s Election Industrial Complex” and their pursuit of fair and transparent elections.</p>
<p>Hoft talks about his beliefs that Conservatives debate voting logistics while clandestine, leftist entities manipulate election processes.</p>
<p>Hoft’s discovery of the 2022 Political Tech Landscape Report by Higher Ground Labs chart highlights this complex labyrinth of groups.</p>
<p>Hoft and Bannon agreed that the work of the leftist groups in framing challenges to elections,  such as voter suppression and misinformation, is the actual attack on democracy.</p>
<p>Bannon has been focused on conserving the American Republic from the attacks against the Judeo-Christian West for decades.  A highly pressing matter is for people to understand how the left is operating to push Sharia supremacy.  Bannon often talks about how platforms are conspiring to promote a foreign ideology to voters, to harm the Republic using funding and technology to reach people and shape public opinion about things like Sharia Law, which is expected to impact the 2024 elections, as he talked about in this clip:</p>
<p>Hoft exposed <a href="https://highergroundlabs.com/">Higher Ground Labs</a>, led by figures with left-leaning backgrounds, and talked about how they have access to technological innovation to aid left-leaning candidates. All of this is very challenging for the America First movement.</p>
<p>According to the Gateway Pundit reporting, the group’s inception likely predates its official launch, possibly receiving government funding during the Obama administration. The organization claims to support startups aiding candidates’ electoral success. The 2022 report reveals intricate connections within the Election Industrial Complex, involving nonprofits and publicly traded companies, mirroring a military-like operation. This setup echoes concerns voiced about the erosion of democracy in America.</p>
<p>When Obama was in office, it was about the time the Sharia Supremacy movement started in America as the “Transformation of America,” the “Hope and Change” of Obama’s supporters.</p>
