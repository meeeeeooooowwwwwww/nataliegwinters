<p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and prominent attorney for Donald Trump, has been disbarred in New York amid allegations that he played a significant role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. A New York appeals court revoked Giuliani’s New York law license, citing dissemination of false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers, and the public in his capacity as Trump’s lawyer. His law license remains under review in Washington, D.C., as well.</p>
<p>Giuliani <a href="https://x.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1808178653479817701">responded</a> to the disbarment with a strongly worded statement, accusing the judicial system of being politically biased.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I’m not surprised that I’ve been disbarred by a Bar Ass’n which is a politically and ideologically integral part of the Democrat one party corrupted court system for a long time,” Giuliani posted on his social media. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He criticized Democrats judges in New York City, likening their selection process to that of a “one party Communist dictatorship” where judges are “selected by local Democrat bosses” and often run unopposed.</p>
<p>His full statement:</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised that I’ve been disbarred by a Bar Ass’n which is a politically and ideologically integral part of the Democrat one party corrupted court system for a long time. Judges, like Merchan and Engoron in NYC are selected by local Democrat bosses. These judges, just like in a one party Communist dictatorship, are not really elected but selected by the Democrat local bosses and often run unopposed. The case is based on an activist complaint, replete with false arguments, a hearing officer who was a former judge from the same corrupt Democrat selection process, and a tape with almost 1/4th of the most critical parts erased and covered up by either the Chief NY Bar "persecutor” and his staff, or the Sec’y of State of Georgia.”</p>
<p>The disbarment adds to Giuliani’s mounting legal troubles. In December, he filed for bankruptcy protection after being ordered to pay $148 million in a defamation case involving two Georgia election workers. The court, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/judge-orders-default-judgment-sanctions-against-rudy-giuliani-in-election-workers-lawsuit/ar-AA1fZR9o?ocid=BingNewsVerp">which denied Guiliani the opportunity to defend himself</a>, found that Giuliani had falsely accused these workers of committing ballot fraud, one of many claims he made in an attempt to support Trump’s bid to invalidate the election results.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyer, Barry Kamins, expressed disappointment in the court’s decision and indicated they are considering their appellate options.</p>
<p>The New York appeals court’s decision detailed several instances of what Giuliani said were false statements. Among them were claims of endemic election fraud in Philadelphia, ballots being smuggled from Long Island, thousands of non-U.S. citizens voting in Arizona, and Dominion Voting Systems machines being manipulated in Georgia.</p>
<p>Giuliani, a Republican, who has been admitted to practice law in New York since 1969, now faces the prospect of continuing his legal battles without the ability to practice law in his home state. His disbarment marks a significant attack on a man who once served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and was celebrated for his leadership during the September 11 attacks.</p>

<p>In addition to his more recent controversial activities, Giuliani’s career was marked by notable achievements, including his role as the lead prosecutor in dismantling the mob in the 1980s. He led the prosecution in the famous <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-pizza-connection-35th-anniversary-040519">“Pizza Connection”</a> case, which was dubbed by the media at the time. The case involved a massive heroin and cocaine trafficking operation run by the Sicilian Mafia in the United States and Italy, and it resulted in significant convictions that helped cripple organized crime.</p>
<p>Despite his disbarment and ongoing legal challenges, Giuliani remains a vocal supporter of Trump and continues to defend his actions related to the 2020 election. His statement in response to the disbarment underscores his belief that he is a victim of a politically motivated judicial system, a narrative he has frequently employed in his defense.</p>
