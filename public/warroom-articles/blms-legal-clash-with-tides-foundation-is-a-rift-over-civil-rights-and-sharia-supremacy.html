<p><a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/black-lives-matter-global-network-foundation-announces-6-5-million-fund-to-support-organizing-work/">Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation</a> has taken legal action against the <a href="https://www.tides.org/">Tides Foundation</a>, a prominent progressive nonprofit, in a lawsuit that has sent shockwaves through the activist community. The lawsuit, demanding a staggering $33 million, alleges that the Tides Foundation has misappropriated funds intended for BLM, redirecting them towards activities unrelated to the organization’s core mission.</p>
<p>It appears that in the world of leftist nonprofits, there is a breakdown over the definition of “Civil Rights,” with Sharia Supremacy not being considered a legit grievance to BLM.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Tides diverted funds intended for BLM to support anti-Israel protest groups and other political activities. Tides, a fiscal sponsor for various progressive organizations, including BLM, has been accused of deceptive practices and operating without proper oversight. The lawsuit highlights the complexities of managing donations and the importance of transparency and accountability in nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>According to a New York Post article, at the heart of the controversy are accusations that the Tides Foundation, known for its substantial financial resources and liberal agenda, has diverted BLM funds to support causes not endorsed by the movement, causing jealousy to rise between different groups.</p>
<p>More specifically, the lawsuit claims that money meant to support the fight against racial injustice has been used to fuel anti-Israel protests on college campuses and finance other political endeavors.</p>
<p>From a <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/blm-nonprofit-says-tides-foundation-mismanaged-33-million?utm_medium=lawdesk&amp;campaign=DEA4796E-0CD3-11EF-8E52-30A0F143A863&amp;utm_source=twitter">BloombergLaw</a> report on the matter:</p>
<p><em>“After the Black Lives Matter movement surged following the 2020 police murder of George Floyd, donations flowed to the BLM GNF nonprofit. Established in 2017 to center Black political advocacy and invest in Black communities, the organization didn’t have tax-exempt status. As a result, it enlisted the Tides Foundation, a left-leaning donor advised fund based in San Francisco, to help it accept donations, "parking” the funds with Tides.</em></p>
<div>
<p><em>Black Lives Matter said in its lawsuit that the Tides Foundation gave oral promises that the funds would be available to Black Lives Matter, as soon as it received its tax-exempt status. BLM ended its relationship with Tides in 2022, according to the complaint, and Tides has refused to transfer millions of dollars in funds to BLM, according to the complaint.</em></p>
<p><em>Tides manages over $1.4 billion in assets—more than many regulated community banks—allegedly acting like a bank without licensing, while preying on Black- and Brown-led organizations, according to the <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/bdXg">complaint</a> filed Monday by the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.</em></p>
<p><em>In a 2020 oral contract, Tides led the nonprofit to believe that donations solicited toward a "collective action fund” were meant for BLM GNF and would be easily and readily available for distribution toward Black causes at the nonprofit’s request. Instead, Tides deliberately sent part of the funds to third-party organizations without BLM GNF’s authorization, the complaint said.”</em></p>
<p>Tides categorically denies the allegations and maintains its commitment to supporting racial justice groups, the organization said in an emailed statement that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Resources in the Black Lives Matter Support Fund were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,” the statement said.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The revelation of this legal battle has ignited a firestorm on social media, with reactions ranging from disbelief to amusement. Many users have seized upon the irony of two organizations with ostensibly aligned goals finding themselves at odds in such a public and contentious manner. Some have dubbed it a case of “scam artists suing each other,” while others have humorously referred to it as “commies suing the commies.”</p>
<p>Amidst the online chatter and speculation, the Tides Foundation has vehemently denied the allegations, dismissing the lawsuit as baseless and without merit. This defiant stance sets the stage for what promises to be a protracted and closely watched legal showdown, with significant implications for both organizations and the broader landscape of progressive activism.</p>
<p>The outcome of this legal battle remains uncertain, but the implications are profound. Beyond the immediate financial stakes, the lawsuit raises important questions about transparency, accountability, and the integrity of nonprofit organizations. As entities entrusted with advancing social justice causes, both BLM and the Tides Foundation are under intense scrutiny to ensure that their actions align with their stated missions and values.</p>
