<p>Flashback to 2022: RFK Jr.’s Explosive Interview with Steve Bannon on Vaccine Mandates and Big Pharma
In a 2022 interview on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discussed his controversial book on Dr. Anthony Fauci, Big Pharma, and the COVID-19 vaccine. This discussion has resurfaced as especially timely given Kennedy’s recent public endorsement of Donald Trump for President, a move that has sent shockwaves through both the Democratic Party and the broader political landscape.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“When they say that I am promoting vaccine misinformation, they will never tell you a single piece of misinformation that I have promoted. The term ‘vaccine misinformation’ is a euphemism for any statement that departs from official orthodoxy or that questions the safety and efficacy of a pharmaceutical product, whether that statement is false or true,” Kennedy told Bannon.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy has constantly criticized the involvement of intelligence agencies like the CIA in public health matters, where he believes they have no place. He argued that censorship and control over public discourse are pervasive issues, particularly when it comes to discussions about vaccines and public health. “This is information warfare,” he said, highlighting the strategic manipulation of narratives to silence dissent and protect powerful interests.</p>
<p><strong>Kennedy’s Endorsement of Trump and the Populist Movement</strong></p>
<p>The timing of remembering this interview is particularly significant in light of Kennedy’s recent endorsement of President Donald Trump for re-election, which marks a pivotal moment for the <a href="https://warroom.org/a-populist-unity-the-irony-of-rfk-jr-endorsing-trump-and-the-promise-of-a-new-political-coalition-mike-benz-in-the-warroom/">populist movement</a> in America. Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump, despite their differing political backgrounds, underscores a unifying effort to challenge establishment politics and support “America First” policies. As Bannon noted during the interview, Kennedy’s stance is not about being anti-vaccine but about advocating for transparency and accountability—a message that resonates with many Americans across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Kennedy, long labeled by mainstream media as a leading figure in the “anti-vax” movement, clarified his position to Bannon, stating emphatically that he is not anti-vaccine but is instead pro-science and against “bad vaccines.”</p>
<p>He explained that he supports vaccines that are “properly tested in a controlled trial” and have demonstrated positive long-term health outcomes.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>He said, “If you come to me and say, here’s a vaccine that five years after you give it, more people are alive in the vaccine group than the placebo group and they are healthier, I would be 100% for that vaccine. I just want good science.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy also highlighted, to Bannon, the changing industry definition of “misinformation,” which now includes any statement that departs from official narratives or questions the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. He pointed out the absurdity of being labeled an anti-vaxxer simply for challenging the unchecked power of Big Pharma: “The term vaccine misinformation is a euphemism for any statement that departs from official orthodoxies.”</p>
<p>Kennedy has a long history of advocating for public health and regulatory accountability, a legacy that dates back to his family’s extensive involvement in public health institutions. He criticized Big Pharma for its repeated criminal behavior, noting that the four major vaccine manufacturers have paid $35 billion in penalties since 2009 for various offenses, including knowingly causing harm with their products. “The only place they can never get caught is with vaccines,” he remarked, pointing to the legal immunity vaccine makers enjoy.</p>
<p>This is an important time for America to understand the Populist movement that is on the ballot in November.</p>

<p>Kennedy’s alignment with Trump, a figure historically seen as an outsider by mainstream political elites, also highlights the growing coalition of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans rallying around populist ideals. This moment is historic not just for the populist movement but also for the Kennedy family, known for their deep ties to numerous high-profile federal agencies.</p>
<p>As Bannon emphasized during the interview, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not an anti-vaxxer. He is a critic of Big Pharma’s unchecked power and a staunch advocate for public health transparency and accountability. His recent endorsement of Donald Trump and the ensuing media storm only add to the ongoing debate about vaccine mandates, government overreach, and the role of powerful corporate interests in shaping public policy.</p>
