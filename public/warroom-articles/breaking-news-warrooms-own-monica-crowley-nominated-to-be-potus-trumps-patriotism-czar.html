<p>Monica Crowley, a long-time War Room contributor, and former U.S. Treasury official, appeared on the WarRoom with Steve Bannon on Thursday to give the details of her exciting news, as she has been nominated for a significant new role in President Trump’s second term. Dubbed the "Patriotism Czar,” Crowley’s appointment as Chief of Protocol and Assistant Secretary of State highlights her extensive experience and deep dedication to America.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is the Role of Chief of Protocol?</strong></h3>
<p>Crowley’s responsibilities as Chief of Protocol go far beyond ceremonial duties. She will oversee critical diplomatic engagements, ensuring seamless interactions between the President, Vice President, and international leaders.</p>
<p>"When heads of state land at Andrews Air Force Base, the first person they’ll see is me,” Crowley explained enthusiastically. She added, "There’s no greater responsibility than representing the United States of America to the world.”</p>
<p>Crowley will brief President Trump and Vice President Vance on global protocols and accompany them on all international trips aboard Air Force One.</p>
<h3><strong>Managing Historic Events</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to diplomatic duties, Crowley has been tasked with leading preparations for major upcoming events. These include America’s 250th birthday in 2026, the World Cup final in New York/New Jersey, and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"President Trump has entrusted me with an incredible portfolio,” Crowley said, noting the significance of these global milestones. She described her role as ensuring that the United States shines on the world stage.</p>
<h3><strong>From Treasury Official to Patriotism Czar</strong></h3>
<p>Crowley previously served as a senior official at the U.S. Treasury Department during Trump’s first term. There, she helped deliver what she calls a "blue-collar boom” through economic policies that benefited all Americans.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her time at Treasury, Crowley said, "I’m extremely proud of the work we did to create a rising economy for every single American.” She also highlighted her involvement in enforcing sanctions, stating, "We targeted bad actors effectively and made a real impact.”</p>
<p>Crowley credited her academic background—a PhD in international relations from Columbia University—and her work at Treasury for preparing her for this new challenge.</p>
<h3><strong>"Patriotism Czar”: A Fitting Title</strong></h3>
<p>The title "Patriotism Czar” was suggested by a colleague, and Crowley fully embraced it. "I absolutely love that,” she said. "It perfectly captures the spirit of this role. Representing the country I love is a true labor of love.”</p>
<p>Steve Bannon praised Crowley for her qualifications, calling her "a superstar” and "an incredible person.” He added, "President Trump picked well.”</p>
<h3><strong>A Lifelong Dedication to America</strong></h3>
<p>Crowley emphasized her deep love for the United States. "This country is my heart and soul,” she said. "I’ve dedicated my entire adult life to saving and supporting it.”</p>
<p>She also shared a lighthearted moment about her mother’s reaction to her new role. "My mom said, ‘Finally, you’re putting that Ivy League PhD to use!’” Crowley laughed.</p>
<h3><strong>Still Connecting with the War Room Posse</strong></h3>
<p>Despite her new responsibilities, Crowley remains committed to her audience. She continues hosting <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-monica-crowley-podcast/id1614718499"><em>The Monica Crowley Podcast</em></a>, which is available on major platforms like Rumble, Spotify, and Apple.</p>
<p>"I’m so grateful to Steve [Bannon], this audience, and mostly President Trump for giving me this extraordinary opportunity,” she said.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s Next for Crowley?</strong></h3>
<p>Crowley must undergo Senate confirmation for her role, and she joked about rallying the War Room Posse for support. Once confirmed, she’ll step into a role of immense responsibility, representing America on the world stage and shaping key international moments.</p>
<p>"This job is a huge thrill,” Crowley said. "I’m honored and humbled to have the chance to serve my country again.”</p>
<p>With her passion, experience, and commitment, Crowley is ready to embrace the challenge. She says, "There’s no greater honor than serving the United States of America.”</p>
