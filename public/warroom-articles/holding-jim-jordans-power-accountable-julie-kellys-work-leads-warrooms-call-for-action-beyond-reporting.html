<p>Independent journalist Julie Kelly has emerged as a prominent figure in shedding light on the practice of lawfare pushing for consequences, particularly regarding the actions of Republicans in the US House of Representatives. Some Republicans, like US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), assert that they are doing their jobs, sufficiently informing the public about civil liberties issues as if they were journalists.</p>
<p>On a recent podcast with Seb Gorka, Jordan, who is chairman of the House <a href="https://republicans-judiciary.house.gov/">Committee on the Judiciary</a>, chairman of the Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, and member of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability, appeared to be saying that he was doing enough of his job by merely reporting to the American people that there were problems with corruption deep in the heart of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In contrast, Kelly’s recent focus as an actual journalist includes dissecting the legal proceedings surrounding the events of January 6, particularly the question of whether a president can be criminally prosecuted for acts committed while in office. She highlights the skepticism among justices regarding the prosecution of a president for official acts and the potential slippery slope toward a “banana republic” style of governance. She has also been reporting on the newly exposed evidence of corruption from court documents.</p>
<p>Her work is a leading beacon for activists to understand complex issues and demand change.</p>
<p>Consider this recent post by Kelly:</p>
<p>In addition to scrutinizing the legal proceedings facing President Trump and his supporters, Kelly has uncovered evidence suggesting coordination between the National Archives and the Biden White House to bolster cases that appear to show a Criminal conspiracy against Trump.</p>
<p>This revelation challenges the Department of Justice’s narrative and raises questions about the extent of political influence in legal matters.</p>
<p>That type of reporting takes a lot of courage, which apparently our civil servants in the US House, like Jordan, do not have.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kelly’s investigations have exposed the inner workings of congressional committees, particularly efforts to combat government overreach and censorship.</p>
<p>In contrast,  Jordan emphasized to Gorka, in his recent interview,  the importance of their committee work in educating the public, but that is as far as his work as a powerful House member goes.</p>
<p>When pressed on whether reporting to the American people is enough, Jordan tells Gorka that he believes what they are doing is enough.</p>
<p>Kelly, along with Steve Bannon, Gorka, the WarRoom audience, and others, press for more than just information dissemination—there is a coordinated movement of Americans who call for tangible consequences for those who have committed crimes under the guise of legal authority.</p>
<p>Despite the progress made in uncovering wrongdoing, Kelly, Bannon, the WarRoom posee, and others remain unsatisfied with the lack of substantial repercussions for offenders.</p>
<p>Jordan doesn’t even report on those developments.</p>
<p>While information and transparency are crucial, they argue that true justice requires holding individuals accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>Through her investigations, Kelly challenges Republican lawmakers’ assertions that they have done enough for the American people.</p>
<p>As the legal battles continue for Trump and others in the America First movement, Kelly and others appear to be dug into this battle to force the US House to make much bolder moves than just acting like journalists and informing people of things.</p>
