<p>As an emergency room physician and a combat veteran, I have witnessed the dire consequences of drug trafficking on American soil—a crisis significantly exacerbated by the Biden administration’s ineffective border policies.</p>
<p>The stark increase in drug-related emergencies paints a grim picture of the situation, highlighting the urgent need for a decisive turnaround in our approach to border security and drug trafficking. My campaign for Congress is propelled by a commitment to leverage my medical and military expertise to champion policies that will block this flow of illegal drugs. The solution is clear: electing President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans. This is the only viable path to resolving this crisis and safeguarding our nation’s future.</p>
<p>Under President Trump, we saw unprecedented steps toward securing our borders, significantly disrupting the operations of drug cartels and reducing the influx of illegal drugs into our communities. His administration’s commitment to constructing physical barriers, enhancing surveillance technology, and bolstering the support for border patrol and law enforcement agencies marked a period of substantial progress in our fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<p>However, the Biden administration’s rollback of these policies has led to a resurgence in drug trafficking, undoing the gains made during Trump’s presidency. It’s evident that the current administration’s approach has failed Americans, making the re-election of President Trump and his support for pro-border security as well as MAGA Republicans critical to reinstating effective border security measures and drug trafficking interventions.</p>
<p>As dire as the situation may currently seem, the power to control our borders will be in the hands of U.S. citizens in this upcoming election. The following are steps the American people can take to reclaim our borders:</p>
<p>1. Re-Elect President Trump: His proven track record on border security and his unwavering stance against drug cartels are essential for reversing the current tide of drug trafficking into our country.</p>
<p>2. Support Pro-Border Security Republicans: We must electrepresentatives who will support President Trump and are committed to reinstating the president’s border policy and expanding on it to further secure our border.</p>
<p>3. Advance Comprehensive Security Measures: Beyond physical barriers, we must invest in advanced surveillance technologies and increase the personnel and resources available to Border Patrol and customs officials.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s drug trafficking crisis is a clear demonstration on why we must reject liberal, open-border policies and turn to experienced and decisive leadership that only President Trump and like-minded Republicans can provide. As someone who has seen the devastating impact of this crisis firsthand, both on the battlefield and in the emergency room, I am convinced that the restoration of strong border security and effective drug trafficking policies under a Republican administration is imperative.</p>
<p>The numbers don’t lie. Under Joe Biden’s disastrous leadership, criminals are smuggling drugs across the border in record numbers. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized approximately 140,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 81,000 pounds of cocaine, and 27,000 pounds of fentanyl in 2023. As a physician, this is heartbreaking to see. That amount of fentanyl is enough to provide the whole U.S. population with a lethal dose. And until we have a president in office who truly caresabout the American people, this will only get worse.</p>
<p>House Republicans made the right call to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He followed Biden’s bidding and opened our border knowing the consequences – countless more American deaths. However, one impeachment is not enough. We must retake our government from those who wish us harm.</p>
<p>As your representative in Congress, I pledge to fight tirelessly for the re-election of President Trump and to support pro-border security Republicans who are dedicated to eradicating this scourge from our communities. Together, we can restore security, protect our citizens, and ensure a brighter, safer future for all Americans.</p>
