<p>Three years ago, the United States had a growing American populist movement. Host of the WarRoom Steve Bannon has been an influential leader, daily broadcasting strong critiques of foolish government policies and reminding his viewers of the impact of these policies on everyday citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The vast majority of pressure put on by illegal aliens is among the Hispanic and African-American community,” Bannon said. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the video below, he points out that businesses, particularly those represented by entities like the Chamber of Commerce, benefit from the influx of illegal labor because it allows them to pay less than market wages, avoid healthcare costs, and sidestep other financial responsibilities that would typically apply to legal workers.</p>
<p>This, according to Bannon, is a deliberate strategy to keep wages low and maximize profits at the expense of American citizens.</p>
<p>In the following flashback to 2021, Bannon argues that bad government financial policies disproportionately affect minority communities and lower-income groups, not just the “white kids” often mentioned in political rhetoric.</p>
<p>Bannon’s response to the claim, which he read at the opening of the segment,  that only white children are impacted by these policies, and that is why white people care,  was pointed:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Sir, you are horribly incorrect. It’s not white kids. It’s Hispanic, African-American, every kid in this country.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>By broadening the focus to all citizens, regardless of race, Bannon emphasizes that populism is about protecting and empowering every American, not just a select group, or tribe or racial set.</p>
<p>Bannon, in the video, believes that the most significant pressure from illegal immigration and other governmental failures falls on minority communities and he argues that these communities are most affected because they are often at the lower end of the economic spectrum, where competition with illegal immigrant labor is most intense.</p>
<p>Bannon’s argument is that populism is color-blind and inclusive, focused solely on the interests of American citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Populism is color blind. It doesn’t care about your religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual preference. Here’s what it cares about: it cares that you’re a citizen of this country,” he said. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>By framing the issue in this way, Bannon is challenging both the left and right-wing establishments, which he sees as using race to divide the populace and distract from the economic exploitation facilitated by their policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bannon points to economic indicators under the Trump administration to support his claims about the benefits of populist policies.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> “Donald Trump saw the lowest Hispanic unemployment, lowest African-American unemployment, with wage increases, particularly for people without high school educations—blue-collar over white-collar,” Bannon noted.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>According to Bannon, these achievements demonstrate that when the government focuses on citizen-oriented policies, all Americans, especially those in the working class, benefit.</p>
<p>As Bannon sees it, the populist movement is not about racial or cultural identity but about economic justice and fair opportunity for all citizens. He urges his listeners to reject the false dichotomy of race and instead focus on the common struggles facing American citizens, especially those most impacted by governmental failures and the elites’ self-serving policies.</p>
<p>Bannon’s remarks highlight the need for a government that prioritizes its citizens over the elite’s and corporate donors’ interests. He calls for a populist-nationalist movement that transcends race and identity politics and focuses instead on the economic and social needs of all Americans.</p>
<p>By doing so, he believes that a more inclusive, prosperous, and fair society can be achieved, one that works for the people rather than against them.</p>
