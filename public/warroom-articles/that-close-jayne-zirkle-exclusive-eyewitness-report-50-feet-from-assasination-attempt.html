<p>As of 9 PM on Saturday, ABC News reported that Donald Trump had been rushed off stage during an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a possible assassination attempt on the former president.</p>
<p>The featured image of this article is a snapshot of Trump as he approached his speaking spot, taken on Saturday at the PA rally by Corey Check as Trump stopped for the photo. Check has given the WarRoom an exclusive on his eyewitness story.</p>
<p>Secret Service agents are seen on media coverage as they swarmed Trump and ducked behind the podium where he had been speaking. Blood could be seen on Trump’s right ear as agents surrounded him and led him off the stage to a waiting vehicle to whisk him away. Trump is “fine,” a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The alleged shooter is dead. One spectator is dead, while two are in serious condition, according to officials.</p>

<p>In the harrowing account from the Trump MAGA Rally, by phone,  Check recounted to WarRoom correspondent Jayne Zirkle his experience of being near the deadly shooting incident that is now being called an assassination attempt.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This is the most shook up you’ve ever been in your life. And you were about 50 to 60 feet away from someone that was shot. I heard something go off because I thought it was fireworks, but then I heard, ‘Get down!’ and I knew what this was,” Check told Zirkle.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Check described Zirkle as being about 50 to 60 feet away from where someone was shot, vividly recalling the scene as he stood in the front bleacher area. Despite the initial confusion, thinking the noise was fireworks, he said he quickly realized the gravity of the situation as people screamed. The Secret Service ordered everyone to get down.</p>
<p>“The Secret Service yelled at everyone to get down. I saw the gunman pull out a gun, and everyone got down.I remember that red, white, and blue banner next to me, and the image of the gunman holding his gun before he was shot down.”  gunman was apparently on a roof somewhere, and he was shot dead on the roof.”</p>
<p>Check detailed the chaos that ensued, noting the image of the shooter on the roof and the red, white, and blue banners that framed the scene. He remembered a moment of terror and solidarity as the crowd chanted “USA, USA” once they knew Trump was safe. Despite the traumatic event, Corey and other attendees joined in prayer, seeking comfort amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>Reflecting on security measures, Corey expressed concerns about how the gunman managed to get on the roof and pointed out the vulnerability of the open metal gates behind the bleachers. As the interview concluded, Corey was relieved to be safe but remained shaken by the experience, highlighting the need for heightened security at such events.</p>
<p>“Once the shooting was done, a bunch of us got up and started chanting ‘USA, USA’ for about 10 seconds. Many people were crying. I joined strangers in saying prayers, hoping we lived through it. When we were told to get out, I don’t know what happened to the person who was shot, but my buddy was assisting someone. My concern is how the gunman got on the building. The metal gates behind the bleachers were completely open,” Check said.</p>
<p>In a statement to his social media, Trump posted on TruthSocial that he was shot “with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,” during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement for the rapid response and extended his condolences to the family of the person who was killed and the other person who was injured.</p>
<p>“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country,” Trump said.</p>
