<p>President Joe Biden has awarded EcoHealth Alliance – a controversial non-profit that partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on manipulating viruses similar to COVID-19 – with new multi-million dollar grants for pandemic-related research.</p>
<p>Run by notorious COVID-19 "natural origins" propagandist and Chinese Communist Party-funded <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/03/25/whos-peter-daszak-authored-ccp-studies/">researcher</a> Peter <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/06/21/scalp-daszak-recused-from-covid-commission-after-repeated-national-pulse-exposes/">Daszak</a>, EcoHealth Alliance received millions of dollars from Anthony Fauci's National Institute of Health (NIH) agency for work on "<a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/06/08/daszak-reveals-chinese-colleagues-manipulating-coronaviruses/">killer</a>" viruses. Summaries of their joint research â€" recently <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/05/15/wuhan-lab-erases-nih-ties-gof-research/">wiped</a> from the Chinese lab's website â€" reveal scientists creating "chimeric" viruses that spread in humans at rates "equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV."</p>
<p>War Room can now reveal that EcoHealth Alliance has received a new $3 million "Combatting Weapons of Mass Destruction" <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_HDTRA12310006_9761">grant</a> from the Department of Defense's (DOD) Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) aimed at "reducing the threat of viral spillover from wildlife in the Philippines." EcoHealth Alliance's work in China was carried out under the same alleged objective of combatting "viral spillover."</p>
<p>The grant started on December 12th, 2022 and is set to extend through December 11th, 2025.</p>
<p>The grant is part of a program "to support the advancement of fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences with an emphasis on exploring new and innovative research for combating or countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)."</p>
