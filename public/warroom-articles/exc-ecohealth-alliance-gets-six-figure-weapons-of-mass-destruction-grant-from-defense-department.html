<p>EcoHealth Alliance â€" an American non-profit whose work on coronavirus with the Wuhan Institute of Virology has stirred controversy â€" received a new six-figure grant from the U.S. Department of Defense, War Room can reveal.</p>
<p>EcoHealth Alliance previously manipulated "<a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/06/08/daszak-reveals-chinese-colleagues-manipulating-coronaviruses/">killer</a>" bat coronaviruses with striking resemblances to COVID-19 to become deadlier to humans alongside its Chinese Communist Party-controlled partner, using <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/05/14/exc-navarros-9-indisputable-facts-linking-fauci-to-covid-19-origin/">taxpayer</a> funds from Anthony Fauci's National Institutes of Health (NIH) agency to do so.</p>
<p>Amidst refusing to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/25/one-person-who-might-know-what-really-happened-wuhan/">comply</a> with several congressional investigations into its "gain-of-function" research in Wuhan, EcoHealth Alliance has continued to receive taxpayer-backed grants from various federal agencies.</p>
<p>Most recently, EcoHealth Alliance received a <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_HDTRA12110023_9761">grant</a> totaling $115,000 from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is under the control of the Department of Defense (DOD).</p>

<p>The non-profit was given the funds on September 30th as part of a nearly $400,000 project that was first launched in July 2021 and set to conclude in September 2024.</p>

<p>A federal database reveals the grant is for "combating weapons of mass destruction." The DTRA <a href="https://www.dtra.mil/WhoWeAre/">classifies</a> weapons of mass destruction as "chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents with the potential to hold U.S. and allied interests at significant risk."</p>
<p>The DOD-run program reportedly seeks to have EcoHealth Alliance "predict biothreat impacts from early-stage data via transfer learning."</p>
<p>No further details about the nature of the research supported by the grant, however, were provided.</p>
<p>EcoHealth Alliance's relationship with the Pentagon <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/01/pentagon-gave-millions-to-ecohealth-alliance-for-wuhan-lab/amp/">dates</a> back to at least fiscal year 2014 when it began working on a program labeled "Scientific Research â€" Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction". The program ultimately led to nearly $34 million in taxpayer funds being funneled from the DOD's DTRA to support EcoHealth Alliance.</p>
<p>The unearthed grant follows EcoHealth Alliance receiving a <a href="https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/press-release/ec-republicans-to-nih-why-resume-taxpayer-supported-grant-funding-to-ecohealth/">recent</a> grant from Fauci's NIH agency despite President Donald Trump terminating the non-profit's taxpayer-supported projects after its close ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology were revealed. EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak has also been accused of playing a <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/04/06/revealed-who-picked-peter-daszak-as-a-covid-investigator-the-chinese-communist-party-of-course/">key</a> role in discrediting the "lab leak" theory surrounding COVID-19's origins.</p>
