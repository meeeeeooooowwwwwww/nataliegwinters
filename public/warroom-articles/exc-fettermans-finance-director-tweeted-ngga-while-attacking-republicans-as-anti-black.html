<p>In a stunning display of hypocrisy, a Finance Director for Democratic Pennslyvania Senate candidate John Fetterman, Kelsey Denny, repeatedly used racial and gay slurs on social media, War Room can reveal.</p>
<p>The unearthed posts, which include words such as “n*gga” and “f*g,” appear to be at odds with more recent posts from the Fetterman aide promising to <a href="https://archive.ph/mo5kA#selection-645.192-645.234">“fight for the lives of the Black community”</a> against <a href="https://archive.ph/0tqCV">Republicans</a>.</p>
<p>Denny has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-denny-003093161/details/experience/">worked</a> on the Fetterman campaign since 2021, beginning as a Senior Finance Associate before being promoted to the Regional Finance Director for Western Pennsylvania. She is also a former Finance Assistant for Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock.</p>
<p>In April 2014, a Twitter user <a href="https://archive.ph/vsxTn">shared</a> a photo of Denny from the messaging platform Snapchat captioned “N*gga pls I am swag.” In response, Denny replied “HAHAHHAHA I hate you I’m so ratchet.”</p>

<p>In a post from 2012, Denny also tweeted “hahahahahahahahaha I changed that!! Freaking <a href="https://archive.ph/ceJJc">Mexicans</a>.”</p>

<p>Denny has also used the slur “f*g” and  “f*git” in posts from 2013 and 2014, including replying to a user “bc u a <a href="https://archive.ph/1M3eS#selection-715.0-719.14">fagboi</a>” and “HBD ur both <a href="https://archive.ph/OYn2c#selection-645.0-650.0">fagits</a>.”</p>
<p>She also shared an <a href="https://archive.ph/oioB9">image</a> captioned “U r in fact… a fagit” and <a href="https://archive.ph/dgkmv#selection-645.0-662.0">tweeted</a> “w<span>e’ve got a faguette on the loose.”</span></p>

<p>“<span>Why does Katie send me snapchats of her nose….. </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/queerbag?src=hashtag_click">#queerbag</a>,” she <a href="https://archive.ph/on9wA">tweeted</a> in 2012.</span></p>

<p>Despite posting these slurs, Denny has publicly used her Twitter account to supposedly advocate on behalf of “black and brown communities.”</p>
<p>“Police were created to patrol and kill black and brown communities, never to protect,” Denny <a href="https://archive.ph/XOpVV#selection-645.162-645.249">tweeted</a> while explaining her decision to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. Vice President Kamala Harris also promoted the far-left bail fund, which has stirred <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-bail-fund-promoted-kamala-harris-freed-convict-now-charged-murder">controversy</a> for freeing convicts charged with murder.</p>
<p>“How many black individuals have died at the hands of our militarized police force?” she <a href="https://archive.ph/M44KD#selection-645.0-645.82">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>The unearthed posts also follow the Fetterman <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-gun-violence-race-and-ethnicity-philadelphia-mehmet-oz-4b2f3d7242b9a542a6672dc4b4a08635">campaign</a> attacking Republican challenger Dr. Mehmet Oz as <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-09-20/oz-fetterman-senate-race-jail-sentences">“racist.”</a> The Fetterman campaign has previously dealt with racism allegations due to the candidate brandishing a shotgun to stop and detain an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/politics/fetterman-ads-black-jogger-gun.html">unarmed</a> Black jogger in 2013.</p>
