<p>The Iowa caucus proved that the American people want Donald John Trump to be their president again. All factions of the Republican party must coalesce around President Trump so we can defeat Joe Biden in November. We must fight to have Donald Trump become the next president of the United States, especially after Biden has used every tool at his disposal to destroy our country! We must all step up and do our part in this battle.</p>
<p>With the election starting in earnest with Iowa’s Republican primary, I decided that I needed to be there to support President Trump. I drove out to Ankeny, Iowa, in weather 24 below zero to do my part to fight for our president. When I was there to campaign for President Trump, I heard again and again from Americans how he had changed their lives for the better. The experience of going to Iowa has reaffirmed my steadfast belief that Donald Trump is the only one who can lead us going forward.</p>
<p>As I have stated before, all of President Trump’s GOP challengers must drop out of the race and endorse a leader who brought this country prosperity we had not seen in decades. He is a bold leader who brought stability across the globe through strong America First policies and continues to bring peace to the Middle East with his Abraham Accords. President Trump is a leader who we know will fix the broken system that Joe Biden created.</p>
<p>When we look toward our now nonexistent southern border, we are witnessing what occurs under liberal policies. While other Republicans claim to know how to solve the border crisis, President Trump actually did it. His policies kept illegal border crossings at bay by prioritizing the safety of U.S. citizens and U.S. communities.</p>
<p>President Trump’s opponents love to point to accomplishments that they claim to have personally achieved but in fact were only successful due to President Trump’s tenure in the White House. It was due to his backing that his two closest GOP challengers (both still behind by more than 20 points) were able to achieve the heights that they did.</p>
<p>We have already seen what the other Republicans stand for. They have explained to the country what their vision is, and in not just Iowa but in every poll, the country keeps choosing President Donald J. Trump. This is not a close race – polls have him up by 20+ points. Nothing has changed since I first called on these challengers to drop out after the debate on November 8.</p>
<p>By staying in the race, these pretenders only serve to strengthen Joe Biden. This man is a corrupt president, who despite all his failings, has no real competition in the Democratic primary. This has allowed him to begin preparing for the general election and forcing President Trump to waste resources against candidates who have no business running in this race.</p>
<p>I believe that President Trump’s challengers have an opportunity to prove they are good Republicans who want what is best for this country, and in another election cycle, they may make good candidates for president. However, this is not their moment. They are simply in denial of the inevitable, that President Trump will be the Republican nominee.</p>
<p>I am again calling on the Republican candidates to drop out as we must coalesce around President Trump and work together to defeat Joe Biden in November so we can save our country!</p>
