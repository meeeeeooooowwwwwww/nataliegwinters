<p>A complaint was filed against US Special Counsel Jack Smith with the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility, accusing him of illegal election interference by hastening the prosecution of President Trump to affect the 2024 election.</p>
<p>According to US Rep Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Smith allegedly violated DOJ policy by seeking a speedy trial and bypassing standard procedures, evident in his pursuit of an early trial date and a pretrial writ of certiorari.</p>
<p>A pretrial writ of certiorari is significant because it allows a case to bypass the normal appellate process and be heard directly by a higher court, typically the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In the context of the complaint against Jack Smith, seeking a pretrial writ of certiorari before judgment is critical because it accelerates the legal process, potentially leading to a faster resolution of the case. This could have significant implications, especially in cases with political undertones, as it could expedite the trial and influence the outcome before an impending event such as a presidential election.</p>
<p>By attempting to obtain a pretrial writ of certiorari, Smith is being accused of aiming to expedite the legal proceedings against President Trump so that they impact the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Stefanik said, Smith disregarded a court-ordered stay, serving discovery documents despite the stay’s mandate.</p>
<p>In her letter, she calls for an investigation into Smith’s conduct, asserting it undermines the Justice Department’s integrity and constitutes an attempt to sway the election.</p>
<p>During a Tuesday morning press conference, Stefanik made statements highlighting her concerns over what is perceived as a politically motivated prosecution led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg against former President Trump.</p>
<p>She alleges that the case against Trump is “weak and baseless” and “that the American people know it.”  Stefanik alleges that Bragg’s motives against Trump are driven by partisan motives rather than legal merit because he bypassed the case until the emergence of someone named Michael Colangelo from Democrat Joe Biden’s team began pushing it.</p>
<p>“It is crystal clear from the opening arguments in this case and the evidence that this weak case is blatant lawfare and election interference during the height of the presidential campaign,” Stefanik said Tuesday morning to open her press conference.</p>
<p>As reported in the WarRoom to Steve Bannon, Colangelo is the very same person who made the opening statement:</p>
<p>Stefanik repeated that Bragg’s actions constitute unfair election interference, particularly given the trial’s timing during a presidential campaign and amidst a crime crisis in New York.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mike Davis from Article Three project gave his reaction to Stefanik’s statements, saying that the Stefanik complaint against Smith alleges violations of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting prosecutorial decisions based on elections.</p>
<p>In more detail about the timing, Davis said that Stefanik’s letter outlines Smith’s alleged interference in the 2024 election by rushing to prosecute Trump, adding that despite waiting 30 months to bring charges, Smith demanded a trial within five months, despite the case’s complexity.</p>
<p>“He sought an extraordinary petition for cert before judgment, then changed position, suggesting blatant election interference,” Davis said.</p>
<p>The news of the complaint comes on the same day the judge in the case has fined Trump $9,000.00 and threatened a presidential candidate with jail time.</p>
<p>Davis taunts the judge to imprison Trump, alleging civil rights violations and calling the case corrupt. Watch the full Davis segment for more context:</p>

<p>Multiple people have cited the involvement of a Biden-appointed official, Colangelo, in Bragg’s office numerous times as evidence of political bias. Additionally, the statement criticizes the judge’s connections to Biden and alleges unconstitutional actions, such as a gag order.</p>
<p>Stefanik ended her Tuesday remarks by announcing an official complaint against Joe Biden’s special counsel for alleged election interference and calls for an end to what is characterized as unjust political witch hunts against Trump.</p>
