<div>As investigations into the origins of COVID-19 and Dr. Anthony Fauci's response to the pandemic appear increasingly likely, he claimed the Chinese Communist Party "failed the world" when it came to COVID-19.</div>
</div>
<div>In an apparent last-ditch effort to get ahead of these investigations, he was uncharacteristically critical of Chinese authorities, saying they provided him with "incorrect" information and failed to act "transparently."</div>
<div>
<div>According to <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/covid19-coronavirus-anthony-fauci-china-failed-world/9fc0cb15-7a7f-46fd-a61d-8e3d74ff92d6">9News</a>:</div>
<div>America’s top doctor, Dr Anthony Fauci, has criticised China for “failing the world” by not being “transparent” about the origin and spread of <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/covid-19">COVID-19</a>.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Fauci accused Beijing of providing “incorrect” information about how the virus was being transmitted.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>“For the first week or so, we were getting information that it was not readily spread from human to human, which was incorrect,” he told 9News.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Numerous studies have found the virus started in a wet market in the <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/china">Chinese</a> city of Wuhan.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>“We didn’t get a lot of transparent information from them; they were building 1000-bed hospitals literally overnight,” Fauci said.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>“For them to do that, we were saying something must be going on bad there.”</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Asked if China had “failed the world”, Fauci replied “Yes, I believe they did”. “They should have been more transparent. But they weren’t,” he said.</div>
