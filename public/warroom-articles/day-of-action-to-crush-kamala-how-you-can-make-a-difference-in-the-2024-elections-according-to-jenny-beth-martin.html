<p>Jenny Beth Martin, a leading figure in the conservative Tea Party movement, appeared on Thursday WarRoom with Dave Brat and emphasized the critical importance of grassroots involvement in the upcoming 2024 elections.</p>
<p>With so much at stake, Martin shared numerous ways people can get involved, whether they live in key swing states or not. Her message was clear: everyone has a role in ensuring that conservative values are upheld in the coming election cycle.</p>
<p>Martin highlighted several organizations and initiatives to mobilize voters and ensure election integrity.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>She also stressed the significance of a “National Day of Action” set for August 22, coinciding with Kamala Harris’s speech at the DNC Convention.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I want everyone to go sign up for that,” Martin urged viewers, pointing them to<a href="https://www.teapartypatriots.org/citizensfund/mtv/"> MarchToVictory.com</a>, a central hub for conservative activism.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>One key activity Martin encouraged people to participate in is a postcard campaign aimed at key voters. "Even if you don’t live in a swing state, you can send out postcards to ensure crucial voters turn out,” she explained. The postcards are pre-addressed; volunteers simply need to write personalized messages, with sample messages provided for guidance. This initiative is designed to make it easy for anyone, regardless of location, to get involved in the election process.</p>
<p>In addition to the postcard campaign, MarchToVictory.com offers a variety of other volunteer opportunities. Martin mentioned phone banking, poll watching, and even hosting house parties as ways to contribute. “We will have a guide to show you how to do a house party and have a few friends over to do some of the activities,” she said. These activities include writing postcards, making phone calls, and discussing strategies to get out the vote. Martin emphasized that these efforts are crucial for building a sense of community among conservatives and making a tangible impact on the election.</p>
<p>While her organization isn’t heavily involved in door-to-door canvassing, Martin pointed to other groups taking on this critical task. She mentioned <a href="https://www.tpaction.com/">Turning Point Action</a> and <a href="https://americafirstworks.com/">America First Works</a> as two organizations actively working on the ground. Additionally, she praised <a href="https://sbaprolife.org/">SBA Pro-Life America</a> for its door-to-door efforts and highlighted <a href="https://www.momsforliberty.org/">Moms for Liberty</a> for their work in rallying parents to get involved.</p>
<p>Martin also reassured viewers that despite concerns about a lack of ground game, many national and local groups are making a significant difference.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Rest assured that there is a lot of work going on on the ground,” she said, emphasizing the collective effort across various organizations.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond her own initiatives, Martin mentioned a new PAC started by Jessica Anderson, formerly with Heritage Action, as another way people can get involved. This further underscores the broad range of opportunities available for those looking to make a difference.</p>
<p>For those interested in joining the cause, Martin directed viewers to visit MarchToVictory.com or follow her on social media at @JennyBethM.</p>
<p>Her message was clear: whether through writing postcards, making phone calls, or joining a door-to-door effort, every action counts in the fight to win the White House, hold the House, and secure the Senate in 2024.</p>
<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Jenny Beth Martin’s call to action is more relevant than ever. With numerous ways to get involved, her advice serves as a rallying cry for conservatives to engage in the political process and ensure that their voices are heard.</p>
<p>Whether you’re in a swing state or not, now is the time to find your place in the movement and make a difference.</p>
