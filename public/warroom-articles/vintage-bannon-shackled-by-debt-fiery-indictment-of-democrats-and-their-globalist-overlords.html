<p>Before Steve Bannon was forced to surrender as a political prisoner, he delivered remarks to the WarRoom audience that exposed precisely why the Democrats wanted to see him censored and shackled in a Federal correctional facility for the last four months leading up to the historic 2024 election.</p>
<p>Using his expertise as a financial expert, Bannon has deconstructed the corporate media’s messaging on government spending so that every layperson can understand and vote accordingly.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon has frequently stated, "The citizens of the United States should not be in bondage to anything. Any institution. Any instrument like money. Nothing.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The following is a flashback, some vintage Bannon, from late June 2024, where Bannon ripped apart the corporate media’s messaging and trashed an Axios article meant to gaslight voters:</p>
<p>Bannon’s comments on the Democrats’ foreign funding and what he describes as “bondage for the American people” are a powerful critique of the current political landscape. Bannon, known for his fiery rhetoric and unapologetic defense of populism, has consistently voiced concerns about the influence of globalists and foreign interests in American politics. He argues that this influence is detrimental to the sovereignty and well-being of the United States and its citizens.</p>
<p>During the June broadcast of the WarRoom, Bannon argued that the Democratic Party has become a tool for globalist interests, funded by foreign billionaires who seek to undermine the American way of life. In his view, this foreign funding creates a situation where the American people are placed in “bondage” to global financial systems and markets.</p>
<p>Bannon believes that this financial bondage is a new form of slavery, where Americans are shackled by debt and fiscal irresponsibility orchestrated by political elites in cahoots with globalists. He passionately claims, “These Federal spending [programs] are bondage. It’s the new slavery. It’s bondage to world debt markets and world capital markets.”</p>
<p>Bannon has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s economic policies, accusing him of leading the country into massive debt. According to Bannon, the Biden administration’s approach to fiscal policy is reckless, causing inflation and hardship for ordinary Americans. He contrasts this with what he sees as the “golden age” of the Trump administration, citing low inflation and interest rates as indicators of economic prosperity.</p>
<p>In a pointed critique on that program, Bannon emphasized, “They are telling bald-face lies about how much debt Joe Biden’s front versus Donald Trump, and we’re getting experts to break that down.” He specifically calls out Axios, a media outlet, for perpetuating what he sees as misinformation about the national debt under Biden.</p>
<p>Bannon is not just a critic but a strategist who calls for decisive actions. He advocates for a government shutdown to force a national conversation about fiscal responsibility. He argues that the American people need to wake up to the reality that they are being manipulated and financially enslaved by policies that benefit only the wealthy elite.</p>
<p>Bannon’s call to action is clear: “Shut the freaking government down and force a national conversation because I guarantee you when we show the American people that they’re held in bondage by this irresponsible fiscal madness that only enriches the wealthy, they’ll demand change.”</p>
<p>Bannon blamed globalists for gutting the American middle class and creating an economy that favors the Fortune 100 CEOs at the expense of ordinary citizens. He accuses these global elites of caring more about profits and control than about the well-being of American workers. “Globals, bring jobs back to America. You suck. The money comes. You send it back. Return to sender. We don’t want your greasy stolen money,” Bannon passionately states.</p>
<p>Bannon is also highly critical of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which he claims has been embraced by Democrats to justify endless spending without concern for deficits. He believes that MMT is a dangerous ideology that ignores the real-world consequences of unchecked government spending. “They embrace modern monetary theory. That deficits don’t matter. It don’t matter, and now they’re scared,” Bannon argues, emphasizing that the American public is beginning to see through these economic illusions.</p>
<p>To bolster his arguments, Bannon cites economists and frequent WarRoom guests like Steve Moore, E.J. Antoni, <a href="https://warroom.org/its-as-bad-as-the-1970s-economic-divide-and-the-pathway-out-scott-bessent-analyzes-the-u-s-economy-with-don-jr/">Scott Bessent</a>, and Dave Brat. He believes these experts provide a clearer picture of the country’s economic challenges and the dangers of the current fiscal policies. “I’m gonna get Steve Moore, Scott Bessent, E.J. Antoni, and Dave Brat, because here’s what’s happened in the last 24-40 hours,” Bannon states, indicating his reliance on these voices to dismantle the narratives he sees as misleading.</p>
<p>Bannon’s fiery defense of the American people appears rooted in his belief that foreign interests and globalist agendas are compromising the nation’s sovereignty and economic future.</p>
<p>He sees this as a betrayal of the United States’ foundational values and calls for a radical reevaluation of its fiscal policies. His comments serve as a rallying cry for those who feel disenfranchised by the current political and economic systems, urging them to demand accountability and change.</p>
