<h4>In a recent conversation, Jack Posobiec and Monica Crowley highlighted significant issues surrounding the assassination attempt against President Trump on July 13th, focusing on the role of local police and the broader implications of the Democrats’ defunding agenda. Posobiec revealed disturbing details about how local law enforcement was underutilized and overshadowed, raising critical questions about the impact of defunding policies on national security.</h4>
<p><span><strong>Bottomline: </strong>Democrat Presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s position on Defunding the Police:  <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-embarrassment-of-democrats-wearing-kente-cloth-stoles"><strong>The Embarrassment of Democrats Wearing Kente-Cloth Stoles </strong></a>Her sister,Maya Harris-West, wrote a 2003 manual on Defunding the Police: <a href="https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/organized-for-change"><strong>Organized for Change: The Activist’s Guide to Police Reform.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong>The Disregard for Local Law Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Jack Posobiec’s discussion on the assassination attempt underscored a crucial point about the involvement of local police. According to Posobiec, the tragedy on July 13th involved severe security failures, with local police being sidelined despite their critical role. He pointed out that the local law enforcement agencies in Butler, Pennsylvania, were crucial in responding to the incident but were overshadowed by federal agencies like DHS and the Secret Service.</p>
<p>Posobiec explained, “We revealed twelve independent security failures on the day of the attack. Many of these failures involved local law enforcement agencies who were not given the resources or recognition they deserved.” This statement highlights a broader issue where local police are often underfunded and undervalued, despite their pivotal role in ensuring public safety.</p>
<p><strong>The Democrats’ Defunding Agenda</strong></p>
<p>The conversation between Crowley and Posobiec also touched on the controversial topic of police defunding, a policy pushed by some Democrats that has led to a significant reduction in local law enforcement resources. This agenda has raised concerns about public safety and national security, especially in light of high-profile incidents like the assassination attempt on Trump.</p>
<p>Posobiec criticized the defunding movement, stating, “Local police are often the first responders in critical situations. By defunding them, we are stripping our communities of essential protection and making them vulnerable.” This criticism aligns with broader concerns about how defunding policies impact law enforcement’s ability to respond to emergencies and maintain public order effectively.</p>
<p><strong>The Cover-Up and Its Implications</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the issues with local police, Posobiec and Crowley discussed the broader implications of the assassination attempt and the perceived cover-up by federal agencies. Posobiec highlighted how the Secret Service and DHS obstructed efforts to investigate the incident fully. He said, “The mainstream media seems uninterested in the local law enforcement’s role, and there is a deliberate effort to cover up what really happened on July 13th.”</p>
<p>This obstruction not only hinders justice but also undermines trust in the institutions responsible for safeguarding the public. Posobiec’s investigation revealed that despite the involvement of local police, their contributions were minimized, and their challenges in handling the situation were not adequately addressed.</p>
<p><strong>The Need for a Balanced Approach</strong></p>
<p>The discussion underscores the need for a balanced approach to law enforcement funding and oversight. As Posobiec and Crowley highlighted, local police play an essential role in maintaining security and responding to emergencies. However, the defunding agenda risks undermining their effectiveness and compromising public safety.</p>
<p>Posobiec concluded, “The push to defund local police is not just a policy issue; it’s a matter of national security. We must ensure that our local law enforcement agencies are adequately funded and supported to protect our communities effectively.”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The conversation between Monica Crowley and Jack Posobiec sheds light on the critical role of local police in responding to high-profile incidents and the detrimental effects of defunding policies. By emphasizing the importance of supporting and adequately funding local law enforcement, Posobiec and Crowley argue for a reevaluation of current policies to ensure that our communities remain safe and secure.</p>
