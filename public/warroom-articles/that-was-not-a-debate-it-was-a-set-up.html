<p>Donald J. Trump riding down that golden escalator changed a lot in this country. But perhaps the greatest thing of all was Americans no longer had to settle for leaders who lie to them.</p>
<p>I hate being lied to, and I think millions upon millions of Americans feel the same way. With President Trump, we finally had someone running for office who told the truth. True to form, he was the only person on stage Thursday night that was real. Everything else was a lie. What we witnessed on CNN was not a debate. It was a set up.</p>
<p>Something was up when the Democrat candidate, who last time they barely let leave the basement, agreed to a live CNN debate in <span>June</span>, the earliest ever. In what’s left of his skull full of mush, Biden is still the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cd977f7ff301993f7976974ba07c5495#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20_%20Sen.,he%20finished%20near%20the%20bottom."><span>top law student</span></a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/fact-check-biden-driving-18-wheeler/index.html"><span>truck driving</span></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/biden-south-africa-arrest-mandela.html"><span>arrested with Nelson Mandela</span></a> savant who will take you "behind the barn.” This is the same deranged pompous idiot who has been challenging voters to I.Q. tests and push up contests for four decades. Of course he thinks he can still debate. The question is, who let him think he could?</p>
<p>Nothing about Biden has changed since 2020. He wasn’t cognitively fit then, and he certainly isn’t now. All that changed were the talking points and marching orders. A media that has been propping up a <a href="https://x.com/dom_lucre/status/1800319301335093744?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>husk</span></a> for four years suddenly let go.</p>
<p>Never was a more appropriate term applied than when President Trump dubbed them "Fake News.” Watching the "debate” had an eerily similar feeling to Nov. 3, when Fox refused to call Ohio, Florida, and Texas for Trump, but immediately called Arizona for Biden, to make it seem as if President Trump wasn’t actually winning in a landslide. As the words were coming out of the anchor’s mouths, you could almost see the puppet strings. It was the same thing Thursday evening. What you were watching was not what was really happening. Everything was choreographed — down to the mute buttons on the microphones. They did the same routine of hiding Biden out for a week, pumping him full of God knows what, rigging all the rules in his favor. But it wasn’t setting him up for success. It was giving him a false sense of security, and setting him up to fail.</p>
<p>And when it was all over, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox had the chyrons ready: "SOURCES: ‘AGGRESSIVE PANIC’ FOR DEMS AFTER BIDEN’S PERFORMANCE TONIGHT.”</p>
<p>Biden has been tripping up Air Force One for three years now<span>. </span>But suddenly <span>now</span> Biden is unfit? If all the liars and frauds in the Fake News are being sincere, why aren’t they calling for his resignation immediately? If you can’t run for president, you can’t be president. And then maybe they could ask, who the hell has been running the country all this time?</p>
<p>But of course they are not being sincere. They are reading a script. If you can be <a href="https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/"><span>installed</span></a>, you can be uninstalled. And Biden has outlived his usefulness. They tried to do it the easy way. <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/the-hill/biden-hosts-obama-for-lunch-at-the-white-house/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=t.co"><span>Sending</span></a> Obama to the White House for lunch. Not so subtle <a href="https://x.com/davidaxelrod/status/1721189538880516252?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>tweets</span></a> from David Axelrod. It was only a matter of time that they would resort to more Machiavellian measures.</p>
<p>So pardon me if I’m not giddy at Biden’s demise. Biden was always irrelevant. He’s just another corrupt, senile puppet, in a long line of corrupt puppets. A figurehead of a corrupt system that is about to replace a nominee without a single vote from the People. Talk about a "threat to Democracy.”</p>
<p>"Our Country is being destroyed,” President Trump said, in one of his most powerful moments. "As you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time at this debate. There shouldn’t be a debate.”</p>
<p>President Trump is right. Our Country is being destroyed while the puppet masters replace another puppet.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we must bring back the only thing in our politics that is real. Bring back Trump.</p>
