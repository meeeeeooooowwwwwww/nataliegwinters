                        <div class="article-content">
                            
<div>
<p>Congressional leaders were <a href="https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/Scan%2520Jan%252024,%25202024%2520at%25203.43%2520PM.pdf">warned</a> recently by ten retired FBI executives that we are being invaded. These former G-men put it very starkly:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In its modern history the U.S. has never suffered an invasion of the homeland and, yet, one is unfolding now. Military aged men from across the globe, many from countries or regions not friendly to the United States, are landing in waves on our soil by the thousands – not by splashing ashore from a ship or parachuting from a plane but rather by foot across a border that has been accurately advertised around the world as largely unprotected with ready access granted.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be difficult to overstate the danger represented by the presence inside our borders of what is comparatively a multi-division army of young single adult males from hostile nations and regions whose background, intent, or allegiance is completely unknown.”</p>
<p>In the face of such threats, United States Senators are, like the ancient, lunatic Roman emperor Nero, fiddling while the proverbial Rome burns. As an important new organization in Washington, Rosemary Jenk’s Immigration Accountability Project, has <a href="https://iaproject.org/portfolio/">exposed</a>, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma has in recent months – like a dutiful member of the controlled opposition – been helping his Democratic colleagues under Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s direction negotiate a deal that would, among other travesties, allow 5,000 more illegal aliens to cross the southern border <i>every day.</i></p>
<p>That would translate into another 1.8 million asylees getting into the country, on top of the 10 million estimated to have been let in since Joe Biden’s inauguration. Understandable resistance in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to such an unacceptable initiative means the American Neros are ensuring that border remains wide open.</p>
<p>What makes this protracted exercise not just insane but mortally perilous is the fact that among those illegal entrants are an untold number of Chinese nationals believed to be PRC People’s Liberation Army personnel. Five U.S. Senators <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/672573409/Letter-to-DHS-on-Chinese-Nationals-at-the-Border">wrote</a> about this to the man who, along with President Biden, must be impeached for deliberate malfeasance in destroying the border: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.</p>
<p>The Senators estimated that in Fiscal Year 2023 alone, nearly 95 percent of at least 18,000 Chinese nationals who have illegally entered the United States are unaccompanied adults, with "some of these individuals having ties to the Chinese Communist Party’s People’s Liberation Army.” The Senators correctly observe that, "This trend poses a significant threat to our national security and warrants immediate attention and action from the Department of Homeland Security.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the total numbers of such hostiles allowed to be inserted here are not known with certainty. For example, the <i>New York Times</i> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/china-migrants-us-border.html">reported</a> that 24,000 entered in the last year. The <i>New York Post</i>
<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/02/news/chinese-nationals-crossing-into-us-reaches-new-high/">says</a> that there has been a 7000 percent increase since 2021.</p>
<p>To be sure, the so-called "fact-checker” <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/may/19/tiktok-posts/no-evidence-that-chinese-immigrants-at-us-southern/">Politifact</a> contends that "[There is] no evidence Chinese immigrants at U.S. southern border are ‘troops,’” Yet, Michael Yon, an Army veteran who has gone on to become one of America’s most highly regarded and accomplished combat journalists, is among those who have closely observed and even interacted with such nationals from China. He has <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-countdown-to-the-ccps-shooting-war-the-latest-indicators/">concluded</a> that some are "obviously” military personnel. </p>
<p>Another eyewitness is a newly arrived immigrant from Iran who <a href="https://t.co/2OWenzgaBY">shared</a> with Real America’s Voice reporter Ben Bergquam shortly after he entered our country illegally that the vast majority of the Chinese whom he saw doing the same were military age, traveling without family members and potential threats.</p>
<p>To make matters even more outrageous, we learned recently that the Biden administration is not only failing to prevent such threats from metastazing. It has actually been facilitating them. The <i>Daily Caller </i>has <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/02/dcnf-reporter-describes-how-chinese-illegal-immigrants-get-fast-tracked-to-us/?pnespid=srM6EDRAb7lH1_Kb_CnlGpPT5h_8CIAuPeu8mfpxqgBmfm_SKKcMKQQHkAZuW7FPN0XI3NAL">reported</a> that, in April 2023, key Customs and Border Patrol personnel were directed to <i>cut back on the vetting</i> of illegal aliens from China, reducing the number of questions they are asked from 40 to just 5. The <i>Caller</i>’s Phillip Lenczycki added that, according to one such officer and another source outside CBP, "In effect, this has…increased the speed at which the agents are processing and admitting Chinese illegal immigrants into the United States….It has lowered the bar for them to enter.”</p>
<p>Matters are made worse, and potentially catastrophically so, by three other factors:</p>
<p>1) Veteran CIA undercover operative Charles "Sam” Faddis has <a href="https://andmagazine.substack.com/p/i-guess-we-know-now-what-31-million">revealed</a> that the forensic practice of scrutinizing the cell phones carried by these Chinese men for evidence of their background and contacts has also been eliminated.</p>
<p>2) As with millions of other illegal immigrants, once here, these apparent enemy soldiers have been disseminated all over the country <i>at taxpayer expense</i>. As a result, we are evidentlyclueless also their whereabouts and capacity to engage in espionage, sabotage against critical infrastructure and institutions, assassinations, etc. And,</p>
<p>3) There is reason to believe that such skilled hostiles have not been tasked with simply creating chaos here on the home front. Unfortunately, they may have a <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-what-could-possibly-go-wrong-the-ccps-covert-biolab-program-in-america/">far more terrifying mission</a>: causing mass destruction inside the United States.</p>
<p>How might that be accomplished? At the end of 2022, an observant building inspector in Reedley, California providentially discovered what turned out to be an illegal CCP-operated and -funded laboratory replete with samples of twenty deadly diseases, including ebola. <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/reports/investigation-reedley-biolab-report">Congressional investigators</a> believe other such Chinese biolabs may still be operating elsewhere in America.</p>
<p>You might have expected these revelations would be treated as a first-order national security emergency. After all, <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-red-alert-if-taiwan-votes-for-freedom/">a shooting war</a> with Communist China is distinctly in prospect and the possibility that even <i>one</i> such lab might arm thousands of Chinese special forces <i>here</i> should have set in motion an urgent and comprehensive federal response. </p>
<p>The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/videos/select-committee-depth-video-outlining-investigation-biolab-reedley-california">found</a> that the FBI and Centers for Disease Control have instead been astoundingly indifferent to the discovery of this lab and its myriad pathogens. It took months and numerous, repeatedly spurned requests from Reedley officials to get the two agencies involved. Even then, the CDC declined to sample unmarked packets found in a freezer labeled "Ebola.” </p>
<p>Incredibly, Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/cleanup-suspicious-california-biolab-ties-china-finally-underway">reports</a> the Reedley facility’s contents are being destroyed without public disclosure about the peril they posed – an action that certainly appears to be a deliberate effort to conceal from the American people a mortal danger via thecriminal destruction of evidence.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the criminality underway at the hands of the federal government could be among the most egregious in our nation’s history if the Chinese military personnel Team Biden has allowed into the United States are able to marry up with, <i>and begin disseminating</i>, weaponized biological agents, possibly freshly produced in the Reedley lab’s as-yet-undiscovered counterparts elsewhere across America.</p>
<p>We are on notice that the Chinese Communist Party has exactly such an outcome in mind. As we document in our new <a href="https://theindictmentbook.com/">bestseller</a>, <i>The Indictment: Prosecuting the Chinese Communist Party &amp; Friends for Crimes Against America, China and the World</i>, two decades ago, the then-Defense Minister of China, General Chi Haotien, told CCP party cadre in a secret speech that the PRC leadership’s plans to use biological weapons to <i>depopulate the United States so that it can be colonized by the Chinese</i>.</p>
<p>All this makes the more unconscionable and treacherous the Senate’s failure to reach agreement with the House of Representatives on <i>immediately </i>shutting down the southern border and taking <a href="https://warroom.org/red-alert-xis-arson-is-coming-to-america/">other steps</a> to compel the Biden administration to counter, <i>not ignore</i>, the CCP biowarfare threat inside the United States.</p>
<p>It’s past time for American Neros to become, instead – or be replaced by – American <i>heroes</i>.</p>
