<p><span>Steve Bannon host of the War Room talks about Lula da Silva the president of Brazil’s global war on Trumpism following breaking news of his call to end the trade dominance of the US dollar. Lula’s recent visit to Beijing further confirms his close ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</span></p>
<p><span>"Lula is an agent of the Chinese Communist Party, he’s in Beijing. The first thing he says in Beijing is we have to get off the dollar. We need to go the yuan, we to an alternative currency to break the United States of America. He’s a marxist he’s on their payroll.”</span></p>
