<p>In a surprising twist, House Republicans, led by Chairman Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) of the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight, are intensifying their efforts to challenge the legitimacy of the January 6th Select Committee. Coordinated actions by House Republicans come in response to recent developments surrounding the prosecution of former Trump advisors Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, both sentenced for contempt of Congress related to the committee’s investigations.</p>
<p>"My Committee has spent the past year and a half turning over every rock, examining every shred of evidence, and investigating the entirety of operations of Vice-chair Liz Cheney and Chair Bennie Thompson’s Select Committee on January 6th,” Loudermilk told the Caller about his findings, adding:</p>
<p>"We have resoundingly discovered they were not completely truthful with the American people. They had little regard for House rules and no regard for transparency. They surpressed key pieces of evidence, cherry-picked evidence that supported their narrative, and played a 20 Million dollar blame-game to frame President Trump and Republicans.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Speaker confirmed that significant actions would be taken on behalf of Steve Bannon, the host of the WarRoom program.</p>
<p>The action from Republicans is unfolding just days before Bannon is ordered to surrender himself to federal prison to serve a four-month sentence.</p>
<p>On Monday, Jim Banks (R-IN) set the stage with a pointed letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), expressing gratitude for supporting Loudermilk’s investigation into the committee’s conduct. Banks criticized the committee for alleged partisan biases, procedural violations, and issues with its subpoenas, highlighting discrepancies from traditional congressional norms and raising concerns over evidence destruction. He specifically urged support for an amicus brief to aid Bannon’s appeal, emphasizing fairness and procedural integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Read the Banks letter: <a href="https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bannon_ltr_real_final.pdf">bannon_ltr_real_final</a></strong></p>
<p>These efforts culminated in the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) voting 3-2 to officially declare the Jan. 6 Committee and all its subpoenas as illegitimate, exposing a deepening partisan divide over the committee’s actions and setting the stage for a significant legal confrontation.</p>
<p>In a move that further escalated the conflict, BLAG directed the House Office of General Counsel to file an amicus brief supporting Bannon’s appeal to the Supreme Court. This decision aligns with Loudermilk’s stance that the committee’s actions lacked legal grounding, particularly noting violations of House rules concerning consultation with minority members.</p>
<p>In anticipation of filing the amicus brief, Loudermilk referred to his committee’s findings that the Jan. 6 Committee operated with insufficient transparency and allegedly suppressed critical evidence. He pointedly criticized the committee’s methods as partisan and manipulative, aiming to frame President Trump and Republicans without factual basis.</p>
<p>Loudermilk’s office clarified that the appointment of Vice Chair Liz Cheney did not meet the legal requirement of consulting with a ranking member from the minority party, reinforcing the argument of procedural irregularities in the committee’s operations. The Vice-Chair is not the ranking member, and Cheney was selected by former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Loudermilk’s office told the media.</p>
<p>The significance of these developments extends beyond Bannon’s case, reflecting broader Republican discontent with the committee’s authority and methods left by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Loudermilk hinted at forthcoming legislation nullifying the committee’s work, underscoring ongoing efforts to challenge its legitimacy in legal and legislative arenas.</p>
<p>The Bannon case highlights a pivotal moment for increased congressional oversight and the limits of legislative authority, which Bannon’s program, WarRoom, will discuss as events develop.</p>
