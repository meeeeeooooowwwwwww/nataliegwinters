<p>Joel Pollak Senior Editor of Breitbart News joins Steve Bannon’s WarRoom to discuss how Biden is using the terrorist organization Hamas as leverage against Israel. Following the October 7th attacks the views of Israelis on Palestine has shifted. Israelis do not want any Palestinian state on their border that could unleash further attacks. Pollak spoke with an Israeli government official who said the withdrawal of troops from southern Gaza should not be read too far into regarding Netanyahu giving into pressure from the Biden administration to withdraw troops and not finish the job eradicating Hamas. They expect a more special focus operation as the Israelis enter the last Hamas stronghold, Rafah.</p>
<p>Biden’s move to call for a ceasefire was taking the side of Hamas who has expressed they will not release hostages until a ceasefire happens. Biden undetermined the joint position on the U.S. and Israel on hostage release before ceasefire, strengthening Hamas’ bargaining power. This is not the first time Biden has deterred the destruction of Hamas, he previously discouraged Israel’s operations in the city of Kahn Yunis.</p>
<p>Pollak explains that Biden is using the war for a larger political purpose such as leveraging broader deals in the Middle East that have fallen apart since President Trump left the White House. While Trump weighed common interests of the Saudis and Israelis Biden is attempting to force Israel to accept a Palestinian State.</p>
