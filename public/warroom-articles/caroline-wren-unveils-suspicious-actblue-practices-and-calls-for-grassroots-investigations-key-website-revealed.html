<p>On Friday, Ben Harnwell and Caroline Wren raised significant concerns about the ActBlue platform, highlighting its potential for massive financial misconduct and calling for immediate investigations into the alleged corruption. This discussion, which has gained traction online, scrutinizes the operations of ActBlue, a significant fundraising platform used by the Democratic Party. Wren offered a call to action to the WarRoom audience to start investigations at the grassroots level:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"There is actually a website, that’s really incredible called <a href="https://electionwatch.info/">ElectionWatch.info</a>, where you can go and search, you know, some of the top ones that they’re flagging as this does not seem real. You can search by your state, your neighborhood and go and look, and if you see, like, a neighbor of yours and that in thinking, hey, that person, uh, would never make that type of donation. Politely, kind of ask them, say, did you know that you gave this number of donations?” Wren told Harnwell.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Wren began her report by explaining the context of the controversy saying, “Earlier this week, the Kamala Harris campaign reported over $100 million in donations via ActBlue within just 36 hours after Biden’s departure from the race,” she said.</p>
<p>Notably, she pointed out that 60 percent of these donations came from first-time Democratic donors. This, Wren argued, seemed unusually high and raised suspicions about the legitimacy of the reported figures.</p>
<p>Wren criticized ActBlue’s practices, suggesting that the platform might be involved in a substantial money laundering scheme. She detailed several red flags: "We’ve seen numerous reports of ActBlue processing donations through what some are calling ghost accounts or Smurfs, allegedly laundering hundreds of millions of dollars.” These transactions often involve small amounts—like 40 cents or a dollar—that, when accumulated, lead to significant sums of money.</p>
<p>She expressed frustration with the lack of action from federal authorities. "It’s very frustrating that the DOJ isn’t investigating this, and where are the Republican AGs? They should be opening investigations into ActBlue’s operations in their states,” Wren asserted. She emphasized the need for accountability and transparency, suggesting that investigations by state AGs could be a starting point.</p>
<p>Wren cited an example from a Carolina Journal report to illustrate her point. "A report from 2023 showed an elderly man on a fixed income who, according to records, had made 1,900 transactions through ActBlue. He claimed to have only made two donations in his life,” she said. This discrepancy, she argued, underscores the platform’s questionable practices.</p>
<p>She also criticized changes in ActBlue’s credit card processing methods, noting that they had removed security features like the CVV code, which she believes adds to the platform’s dubious nature. Wren argued that these practices contribute to the suspicion of widespread financial misconduct. "It’s just sketchy,” she said, "and it raises concerns about a massive money laundering operation.”</p>
<p>Wren warned of the broader implications of this potential corruption. "If this money is being laundered from foreign entities, including China, Ukraine, and Russia, it poses a severe threat to the integrity of our elections,” she said. She cited James O’Keefe’s recent lawsuit alleging that over 60 percent of the laundered money comes from China, underscoring the severity of the issue.</p>
<p>While Wren remained skeptical about the DOJ’s willingness to tackle the issue, she called for grassroots action and vigilance. "The most significant outcome could be stopping this pipeline of money. We need citizen journalists and ordinary people to investigate and expose these practices,” she urged. She recommended using resources like ElectionWatch.info to track suspicious donations and advocate for transparency.</p>
