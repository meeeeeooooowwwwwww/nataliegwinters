<p><span>President Trump delivered remarks to supporters on March 4th at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference held in National Harbor, Maryland. During his speech, he highlighted policy plans and promises for his second term in the White House.</span></p>
<p><span>Read below the speech breakdown of President Trump’s second-term agenda from the </span><a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/b88ad447-1abb-44f7-8a37-c479ba44cf34"><span>Trump 2024 campaign</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<p><b>War and Peace. </b><span>"I am the only candidate who can make this promise: I will prevent World War Three."</span></p>
<p><b>Border: </b><span>"Three years ago, we had the safest border in the history of our country—and I will quickly do that again.</span></p>
<p><span>"When I am back in the White House, the very first reconciliation bill I sign will be for a massive increase in border patrol, and a colossal increase in the number of ICE deportation officers."</span></p>
<p><span>"Under my leadership, we will use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American History."</span></p>
<p><span>"I will ask every state and federal agency to identify every known or suspected gang member in America, and every one of them that is here illegally, we will pick them up, and we will throw them out of our country, and there will be no questions asked."</span></p>
<p><span>"To stop the flow of deadly drugs, it will be my policy to take down the cartels just as I took down the ISIS caliphate that everybody said was impossible to do."</span></p>
<p><b>Law and Order:</b><span> "In cities where there has been a complete breakdown of public safety, I will send in federal assets, including the National Guard, until law and order is restored."</span></p>
<p><b>Homelessness:</b><span> "I will end the scourge of homelessness taking over our cities and suburbs. We will take the homeless, drug addicted, and severely deranged, get them off our streets, and create Tent Cities, where we will get them the help they so clearly need."</span></p>
<p><b>Eradicating Marxism from the Government.</b><span> "On Day One, I will revoke Joe Biden's crazy executive order installing Marxist Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Czars in every federal agency, and I will immediately terminate all staffers hired to implement this agenda. I will urge Congress to create a restitution fund for Americans who have been unjustly discriminated against by these Biden policies. And we will ban all racial discrimination by the government."</span></p>
<p><b>Champion of Parent's Rights.</b><span> "I will fight for PARENTS' RIGHTS, including universal school choice, and the direct election of school principals by the parents. If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to vote to fire them and select someone who will."</span></p>
<p><b>Promoting Patriotic Education. </b><span>"Continuing the work of the 1776 Commission, we will teach OUR values and promote OUR history and OUR traditions to our children."</span></p>
<p><b>Protecting Our Youth.</b><span> "I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilation of our youth—and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states."</span></p>
<p><b>Protecting Women’s Sports.</b><span> "We will keep men out of women's sports."</span></p>
<p><b>Smashing the Censorship Cartel. </b><span>"I will destroy the illegal censorship regime and bring back FREE SPEECH in America."</span></p>
<p><b>America First Trade Policy: </b><span>"I will create a true national trade policy like the kind that made America the world's economic powerhouse."</span></p>
<p><b>Total Independence from China. </b><span>"Because economic security is national security, I will revoke China's Most Favored Nation trade status. I will implement a 4-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and gain total independence from China.</span></p>
<p><b>China Accountability for Virus. </b><span>"And I will hold China financially accountable for unleashing the China Virus upon the world.”</span></p>
<p><b>Withdraw from W.H.O. </b><span>"I will again withdraw from the W.H.O.—which stands for "We Hide Outbreaks."</span></p>
<p><b>Energy Independence. </b><span>"Under my leadership, will regain energy independence, as we had three years ago."</span></p>
<p><b>Term Limits. </b><span>"I will fight for a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.</span></p>
<p><b>Using All Lawful Tactics to Win Elections:</b><span> "I will move heaven and earth to fully and finally secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with only paper ballots. But until that day comes, Republicans must compete using every lawful means to win. That means swamping the left with mail-in votes, early-votes, and Election Day votes. Where we can't get rid of drop boxes, we need them in every church and veteran center. And until we can eliminate ballot harvesting, we will become MASTERS at ballot harvesting—beating the Democrats at their own game, except we will do it LEGALLY.</span></p>
<p><b>Bringing Forth a Quantum Leap in American Standard of Living.</b><span> "It is not enough just to stop the forces tearing America DOWN—I want once again to build America UP. It is time to start talking about GREATNESS for our country again. Our objective will be a quantum leap in the American Standard of Living, especially for our young people."</span></p>
<p><span>"We will hold a competition to build new Freedom Cities on the frontier to give countless Americans a new shot at home ownership and the American Dream."</span></p>
<p><span>"I will challenge the governors of all 50 states to join me in a great beautification campaign. We will rename our schools and boulevards not after communists but after patriots. We will get rid of ugly buildings, and return to the magnificent classical style of Western Civilization.”</span></p>
<p><span>"We will support Baby Bonuses for a new Baby Boom."</span></p>
