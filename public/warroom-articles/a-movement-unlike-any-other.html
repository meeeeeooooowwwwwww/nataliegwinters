<p>Tens of thousands of people lined the streets in the supposedly blue suburbs of Philadelphia in Bucks County, Pennsylvania not for a rally, but for a glimpse of President Donald J. Trump working the McDonald’s fry station and manning the drive-thru. Afterwards, President Trump held a packed town hall hosted by former ESPN anchor Sage Steele in Lancaster, followed by Acrisure Stadium erupting in <a href="https://x.com/blairbrandt/status/1848181051471942113?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>chants</span></a> of U-S-A when President Trump arrived at the Pittsburgh Steelers game Sunday night.</p>
<p>And they say this race is "tied.”</p>
<p>That was just on Sunday. Last week, President Trump delivered a <a href="https://x.com/trumpwarroom/status/1847101222043398439?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>masterclass performance</span></a> at the Alfred E. Smith dinner. He had the entire room rolling, a room that was half full of corrupt people who have tried to destroy him. Kamala Harris didn’t even bother to show up, the first no-show of a presidential nominee since Walter Mondale. If we had true elections in this country, instead of election "seasons” using wide open systems designed to be manipulated at every turn, she would probably see the same result as he did.</p>
<p>Yet the Real Clear Politics average as of this writing has Kamala Harris up 0.9 points. But here’s the thing: when you take the average of a bunch of garbage Fake News polls, you’re going to get a garbage result.</p>
<p>And thank God it doesn’t matter. As Charlie Hurt said, "they have completely lost control of the narrative.”</p>

<p>Maybe we’re just not suicidal as a country, because who could possibly want four more years of this? But truly, we love President Donald J. Trump because he loves us. The respect and care he has for the common American is unlike anything we’ve ever seen from a world leader. There is no one like him, and there will never be again.</p>
<p>Despite spying on him, framing him, smearing him, trying to bankrupt him, arresting him, shooting him, and <a href="https://warroom.org/how-do-i-know-theyre-going-to-cheat-because-they-already-are/"><span>every other form of election interference you can think of</span></a>, President Trump is more popular and more loved than ever before. America is eagerly awaiting his return to the White House.</p>
<p>They haven’t just lost the narrative, they’ve lost the populace. If they try to claim the least popular Vice President in history, an installed candidate who has never received a single vote for president, with no crowds, no ability to perform <a href="https://x.com/collinrugg/status/1842333833863291392?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>without a script</span></a>, who has to <a href="https://x.com/collinrugg/status/1831437129538531714?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>bus people in</span></a> for every rally and <a href="https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1837700599342620713?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>can’t even fill a livestream</span></a> on Zoom, who has helped preside over an invasion of our country, the destruction of the economy, the depletion of our energy reserves, the humiliating and disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal leading to war and chaos around the world, who left people to drown in North Carolina, <a href="https://x.com/joma_gc/status/1841584766686007417?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>offer Hurricane victims $750</span></a>, only to finally show up with a <a href="https://x.com/sarahiscensored/status/1844605254370775053?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>C-17 full of supplies for a photo-op</span></a> that was never sent, who will lie about anything, even holding a job at McDonald’s, gets the "<a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1351909028901900289?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>most votes in history</span></a>”…</p>
