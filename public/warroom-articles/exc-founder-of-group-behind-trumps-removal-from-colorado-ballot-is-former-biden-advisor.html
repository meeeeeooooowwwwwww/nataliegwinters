<p>The founder of the group that brought the lawsuit responsible for President Donald Trump’s removal from the 2024 Colorado ballot is a former advisor to President Joe Biden, War Room can reveal.</p>
<p>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a self-identified “nonpartisan” watchdog, brought the Colorado lawsuit against Trump on behalf of “six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters including former state, federal and local officials.”</p>
<p><span>In addition to financial links to far-left mega donor George Soros and Joe Biden’s campaign, CREW’s founder and former Executive Director Melanie Sloan also retains link to President Biden. These mounting conflicts of interest continue to indicate that the removal of President Trump from Colorado’s ballot was a politically motivated hit job aimed at interfering with the 2024 election in favor of Biden.</span></p>
<p>Sloan served as the <a href="http://www.summerstrategies.com/leadership-melanie-sloan">Nominations</a> Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee under then-Chairman Joseph Biden (D-DE) before founding CREW in 2003. She later left CREW in 2014 when longtime Clinton operative David Brock became the chairman of CREW’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Sloan also has a long history of defending Biden family corruption in mainstream media outlets. Sloan, for example, was quoted in an Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-europe-business-c49555d51eb243e09a42f7577fc5937f">article</a> “Ukrainian Energy Firm Hires Biden Son as Lawyer” defending Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board. As the 2014 article noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But "unless there’s solid evidence that Hunter Biden got his job to influence American foreign policy, there’s no clear line that’s been crossed,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA4C0YU/">article,</a> “White House Says No Issue With Biden’s Son, Ukraine Gas Company,” Sloan peddled a similar defense of the then-Vice President’s son corrupt business activities. As the 2014 article explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It can’t be that because your dad is the vice president, you can’t do anything,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div>Sloan has even been quoted in a 2008 <em>New York Times</em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/fashion/23biden.html">article</a> celebrating how Dr. Jill Biden’s occupation didn’t post a conflict of interest:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“If she chooses to work, Dr. Biden’s chosen profession is unlikely to raise any red flags. "It’s almost impossible for me to imagine what kind of conflict there could be with a teacher,” said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group.”</p>
