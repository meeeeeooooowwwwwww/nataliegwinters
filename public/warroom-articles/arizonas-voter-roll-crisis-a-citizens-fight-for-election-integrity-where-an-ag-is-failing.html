<h5>A shocking 1.2 million inactive voters remain on Arizona’s voter rolls, prompting serious concerns about election integrity.<a href="https://x.com/realAlexKolodin"> Attorney Alexander Kolodin</a>, representing the advocacy group Citizen AG, is challenging state officials in court to ensure compliance with federal laws. His lawsuit aims to hold the Secretary of State accountable for failing to properly maintain voter lists. This case could have significant implications for upcoming elections in Arizona and beyond.</h5>
<h3>The Alarming Discovery</h3>
<p>In a recent discussion on the WarRoom with Steve Bannon, Kolodin revealed a startling truth: “Our public records request showed no proof that the Secretary of State has been removing ineligible voters from the rolls.” This revelation highlights a critical failure in the system designed to ensure fair elections. With 1.2 million individuals on the rolls, many of whom should no longer be eligible, the integrity of future elections is in jeopardy.</p>
<h3>Why Are These Voters Still Listed?</h3>
<p>Kolodin explained that several categories of voters should be regularly removed from the rolls. This includes individuals who have died, those adjudicated as insane, and those who have moved out of state. “The law requires that these voters be removed on an ongoing basis,” he noted. However, the response from Secretary of State Adrian Fontes was concerning. Kolodin received an answer that indicated a lack of documentation or action on this critical issue. "I have no documents to show anything that I’ve been doing to take these folks off the rolls,” was the Secretary’s response, which only fueled Kolodin’s determination to pursue legal action.</p>
<h3>The Lawsuit Explained</h3>
<p>In light of the Secretary of State’s inadequate response, Citizen AG filed a lawsuit to demand accountability and transparency. Kolodin explained, “We had to go into court to request emergency relief that these documents be produced to our clients.” This legal move aims to ensure that voters who are unlawfully listed cannot cast their votes. Kolodin emphasized the importance of this case: "With a major presidential election coming up, we want to check against our files and ensure nobody votes unlawfully.”</p>
<h3>The Judge’s Response</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the court took the matter seriously. Kolodin noted that the judge in this case actively questioned the Attorney General’s office about the Secretary of State’s failure to fulfill his responsibilities. "The judge seemed to understand the gravity of the situation,” Kolodin said, signaling a potentially positive outcome for those advocating for election integrity.</p>
<h3>Implications for Voter Integrity</h3>
<p>The ramifications of this lawsuit extend far beyond Arizona. As Kolodin pointed out, "In a state decided by margins of just 10,000 to 20,000 votes, 1.2 million inactive voters is a massive number.” If ineligible individuals are allowed to vote, the credibility of the entire electoral process could be compromised. With such high stakes, it’s crucial that citizens pay attention.</p>
<h3>What Citizens Should Know</h3>
<p>Voter roll maintenance is not just an administrative task; it’s a cornerstone of democracy. Kolodin stressed, "We need to ensure that the voter rolls reflect the true, living population.” Citizens are urged to stay informed about this lawsuit and engage in discussions about election integrity. Following the developments can empower voters and foster accountability in the electoral process.</p>
<h3>Why You Should Follow This Case</h3>
<p>Kolodin’s fight is not just about numbers; it’s about preserving the integrity of elections for every citizen. "Knowing the truth empowers voters,” he said. As this case unfolds, it could set important precedents for how voter rolls are managed across the country. Keeping track of this lawsuit is essential for anyone concerned about fair and transparent elections.</p>
