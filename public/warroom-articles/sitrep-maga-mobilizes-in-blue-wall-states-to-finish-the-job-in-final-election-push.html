<h3>MAGA Eyes Victory in Key Battleground States</h3>
<p>Steve Bannon, Jack Posobiec, and Sam Faddis joined War Room on Sunday’s mobilization Sunday special to discuss MAGA’s final push in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These battleground states are crucial for MAGA’s strategy, and the panel emphasized that victory depends on turnout and canvassing. “This is a historic realignment,” said Faddis. "Trump’s going to win by several points.”</p>
<h3>Trump Support Strong on the Ground in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Posobiec reported from Pennsylvania, observing enthusiastic Trump support among young voters and college crowds. "I wore a Kamala Harris hat at Penn State, and they booed me out of the bars,” he said, illustrating local resistance to the Democratic ticket. Posobiec also highlighted how major media downplays MAGA’s momentum, adding, "The New York Times doesn’t want to focus on election integrity at all.”</p>
<p>Posobiec referred to this video post:</p>
<h3>Closing the "Blue Wall” with Key Allies</h3>
<p>Faddis urged MAGA supporters in Pennsylvania to “finish the job.” With the race tightening, he stressed the need for full-spectrum voter engagement, from friends to neighbors. “You see the finish line ahead,” Faddis said, “but you don’t slow down. You sprint.” He believes that if MAGA mobilizes enough, they’ll break through the blue wall, claiming, “Not only is Trump going to win, but by several points.”</p>
<p>To mobilize this effort, Faddis noted the coordination between grassroots activists and prominent conservative figures like Elon Musk, Miriam Adelson, Chris Buskirk, Charlie Kirk, and Ralph Reed. "You’ve got the precinct strategy guys, and later we’ll have Dan Schultz from Arizona, who’s done an amazing job building volunteer bases,” Bannon added.</p>
<h3>Connecting with Pennsylvania’s Patriot Network</h3>
<p>For those looking to stay engaged, Faddis pointed out resources for Pennsylvania activists:</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Patriot Coalition: "You can go to <a href="https://pennsylvaniapatriotcoalition.com/">PennsylvaniaPatriotCoalition.com</a>,” he said.</p>
<p>"We’re also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1103629663684531/">Facebook</a> and Substack, where we put a lot of time into covering Pennsylvania-specific stories on election integrity and broader national issues that affect this election.”</p>
<p>Online Magazine: The coalition’s Substack magazine explores critical topics, such as local election integrity efforts and concerns about Tim Walz’s connections to foreign influences.</p>
<h3>Building Momentum for Election Day</h3>
<p>Faddis emphasized the power of one-on-one outreach. “Don’t just talk to those who already agree with us,” Faddis said. "Reach out to those undecided.”</p>
<p>Posobiec encouraged people to put their MAGA hats on and go out to popular areas to encourage people to vote.</p>
<p>The team encouraged canvassing and motivating voters right up to Election Day to ensure high turnout.</p>
<h3>Final Message: "Dominate the Field”</h3>
<p>In closing, the panel highlighted the stakes, with Bannon noting, "This is our country, and we’re taking it back.” MAGA supporters are being called to dominate the field through Tuesday, creating a "full-spectrum MAGA dominance” to secure victory and counter what they see as "media narratives designed to suppress their vote.”</p>
