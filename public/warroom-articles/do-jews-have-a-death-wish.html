<p>American Jews have been committed to their own destruction for decades. It has finally caught up with them. Will they break the cycle and free themselves of Stockholm Syndrome?</p>
<p>There are two dates coming up that will show how serious Jews are about their future. On June 25th, there’s a Democrat primary between an <a href="https://x.com/TheEliKlein/status/1804625368365625540?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">anti-semite (Jamaal Bowman)</a> and George Latimer (who seems pretty awful). Nonetheless, will Jews send a "fuck you” message to Bowman and vote Latimer? Then, there’s November 5th. Will Jews get it together and help elect Trump so that they can help themselves?</p>
<p>More than any other faith, Jews consistently vote for and donate to Democrat candidates that hate them. <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/413776/80-of-jews-vote-democratic-far-more-than-other-faiths/">80%</a> of Jews identify with the Democratic Party.  It’s inconceivable to anyone with brain activity above plant life why the very people who were nearly exterminated by Nazis align with a party that supports Nazis, Communists, Fascists, Islamists, Marxists, illegals, criminals, and anti white politicians, candidates, and causes.</p>
<p>Perhaps Jews vote like they’re suicidal <em>because </em>of the Holocaust. Many of the few that survived turned their backs on G-d. How could the once devoted go on believing in divine providence when their master left them for a fate worse than death? The diaspora meant that Jews, specifically the ones who came to America, as well as the ones already here, rejected religion and became increasingly more secular. This is likely due to physical and emotional distance, both from Europe and the Middle East, where their land was stolen and their loved ones killed, survival instincts, and compartmentalizing trauma.</p>
<p>Per a Gallup Poll, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/111424/obama-winning-over-jewish-vote.aspx">74%</a> of American Jews voted for Obama. Here’s a short list of how Obama fucked the Jews. On December 28, 2016, his administration abstained from the U.N. Security Council’s vote on an <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/rubio-president-obama-cements-legacy-as-most-anti-israel-u-s-president-in-history/">anti-Israel resolution</a>, abetting radical, anti-Semitic forces at the U.N., cementing his legacy as the most anti-Israel U.S. president in history. Obama legitimized <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2013/e0707r-summary.pdf">CAIR</a>, which the FBI implied is a front group for Hamas, and which his AG Eric Holder chose <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2011/04/holder-doj-nixed-cair-leaders-prosecution-035327">not to prosecute</a>. Obama advocated for Israel to "go back to the pre ‘67 borders.” Obama’s talk about "occupation” and other deeply anti Israel, anti Judeo Christian American rhetoric and actions even led Democrat Alan Dershowitz to posit, “I think <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/alan-dershowitz-calls-obamas-deep-hatred-israel-ashamed">[Obama] always had a deep hatred of Israel </a>in his heart.”</p>
<p>Then there’s Biden, whose administration is staffed with former Obama nightmares. He presides over an illegal invasion at the southern border giving us Islamic terrorists. The Biden administration appointed CAIR to combat snti-semitism (no joke). Jew haters have been promoted to power positions in all aspects of government, from the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/dhs-officer-pro-hamas-posts-1839670">Department of Justice</a>, to immigration, to education, to military, to medicine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pId5ofskyhk">Biden has threatened Netanyahu</a>, giving money to Iran who supports Hamas. Truly, the ways in which Biden has fucked the Jews are endless, and we haven’t yet reached the bottom.</p>
<p>From the "Squad”, to DSA candidates in New York City Council, hating Jews and supporting an Islamist rape machine is commonplace.</p>
<p>Let’s get into academia, owned by the Left. Is there a person alive who hasn’t seen jihadis hijack school campuses and academia across the nation? NYC Department of Education, David Banks, presides over what has turned into a Hamas outpost. He called members of the Hillcrest High School community, who hunted a Jewish teacher, "<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTGV9FlEhxk">amazing</a></strong>.” New York City public school <strong><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/us-news/nyc-teacher-group-behind-anti-israel-protests-gets-thousands-from-soros-fund/">teachers are behind anti-Israel walkouts.</a></strong> Over in Brooklyn, PS 682 saw a Jewish family get pummeled at <strong><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/23/us-news/nyc-jewish-family-pummeled-at-5th-grade-commencement-by-attendees-shouting-free-palestine-mom-says/">5th-grade commencement</a></strong> by attendees shouting ‘Free Palestine.” This all makes perfect sense; the linchpin to DEI is being anti Judeo Christian because it is part of the "white construct” – meaning civilized society and advancement.</p>
<p>October 7 was a wake-up call to many Jews – but it might be too late. <em>Voting Trump won’t be enough. </em>The panacea is a total rejection of Democrat candidates and causes. It is a total rejection of donating to academia. It is a total rejection of donating to <em>Jewish charities </em>that fuck the Jews by supporting Democrat candidates and causes, like illegals, DEI, BLM, Socialist public housing, and climate, because anything that upends the Judeo Christian American ethos creates an environment to upend the Jews.</p>
<p>Here’s the <em>good</em> news. On June 20th, New York City Democrat DA Alvin Bragg’s office <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/20/us-news/outrage-as-manhattan-da-braggs-office-drops-nearly-all-cases-from-columbia-universitys-anti-israel-protest/">dropped nearly all the charges</a> against Columbia University’s pro-Hamas supporters. This has sparked outrage amongst Jews. As of February  – <em>before</em> Bragg encouraged Islamic terrorists – Jews were looking for a life-line. Per Siena College <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNY0224-Crosstabs.pdf">poll</a>, <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNY0224-Crosstabs.pdf">New York Jews favor Trump over Biden</a> 53% to 44%.</p>
<p>The true test will be whether if Biden picks up a couple thousand votes in Dearborn in hope of keeping the swing state of Michigan in his column turns a few hundred thousand Jewish votes in New York to flip the state to Republican.</p>
