<p>The federal government’s efforts to censor “misinformation” and “disinformation” online â€" which appears to be spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security’s <span>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency </span><span>â€" is being aided and abetted by a host of private-sector companies and left-wing non-profits.</span></p>
<p>Below is a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/csac-members">list</a> of the individuals and their corporate affiliations who’ve been placed on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)’s Cybersecurity Advisory Committee. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/12/01/cisa-names-23-members-new-cybersecurity-advisory-committee">Announced</a> on December 1st, 2021, the cohort “will advise and provide recommendations to the Director on policies, programs, planning, and training to enhance the nation's cyber defense.”</p>
<p>One of its primary focus areas is “combating misinformation and disinformation,” which the CISA press release admits is reliant on “transforming public-private partnership into true operational collaboration.”</p>
<p>CISA has come under recent scrutiny for its efforts, revealed via internal <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/">documents</a>, to censor information about "the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine” on various social media platforms. The agency also played a critical role in the <a href="https://www.trendsmap.com/twitter/tweet/1601352083617505281">“removal of President Trump,”</a> per internal communications released from Twitter.</p>
