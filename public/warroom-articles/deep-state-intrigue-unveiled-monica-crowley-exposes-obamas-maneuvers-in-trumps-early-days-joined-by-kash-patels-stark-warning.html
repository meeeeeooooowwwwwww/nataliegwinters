<p>In a revealing segment on Wednesday’s WarRoom,  Monica Crowley joined Kash Patel to share a previously untold story about the Deep State’s actions during the early days of Trump’s administration. Patel, promoting his book and the film adaptation “Government Gangsters,” highlighted the importance of Crowley’s experience with General Michael Flynn and the Obama administration’s alleged interference in the Trump transition.</p>
<p>Crowley recounted a pivotal moment in December 2016 when she received a call from General Flynn, offering her the role of Director of Strategic Communications for the National Security Council (NSC). Crowley was thrilled to accept what she described as her “dream job.” However, the situation took a surprising turn in early January 2017 when an Obama transition team member contacted her.</p>
<p>The Obama official informed Crowley of two critical points: Ben Rhodes, Obama’s strategic communications director, had pre-spent the NSC budget for the first quarter, leaving no funds for new hires until April. The official then offered Crowley three staff members from the State Department and CIA, whose salaries were already covered, to assist her temporarily.</p>
<p>Crowley immediately recognized the implication of this offer. “They wanted me to accept Deep State spies on my team, at least for a period of time,” she explained. Refusing to compromise, she told the official, “I will do this job myself until April 1st until I can get my team.” Crowley’s resolve highlighted her determination to maintain the integrity of the incoming administration.</p>
<p>Patel commended Crowley’s courage, linking her experience to broader challenges faced by Trump’s transition team across various departments. He warned that similar tactics could be employed in future transitions, emphasizing the need for vigilance and steadfastness in implementing the elected president’s vision.</p>
<p>Crowley’s tenure was short-lived as the Deep State moved against her the next day, forcing her to step aside to protect her reputation. Despite this setback, she later served in the Trump administration at the Treasury Department, where she had a fulfilling experience. Looking forward, she expressed eagerness for a potential second round of service.</p>
<p>Crowley and Patel concluded the discussion by reinforcing the need for resilience and adherence to core values in the face of adversity. Crowley’s story serves as a cautionary tale and a call to action for those committed to preserving the principles of the American Republic.</p>
<p>Overall, the segment illuminated the intricate dynamics of political transitions and the ongoing battle against entrenched bureaucratic interests, offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the Deep State as experienced by key figures in the Trump administration.</p>
