<p>The Centers for Disease Control is planning to hold a confidential meeting to address "developing a public health tool to predict the virality of vaccine misinformation."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/17/2022-25062/notice-of-closed-meeting">meeting</a>, set to take place on March 7th, 2023, was announced on the U.S. government's Federal Register via a "Notice of Closed Meeting" announcement in November 2022.</p>
<p>"The meeting will be closed to the public in accordance with the provisions set forth in sections 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6), Title 5 U.S.C.," explains the announcement before also attributing the confidentiality of the meeting to decisions by the Director of the Strategic Business Initiatives Unit within the Office of the Chief Operating Officer of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p>
<p>The meeting appears to address three primary topics, including "developing a public health tool to predict the virality of vaccine misinformation narratives."</p>
<p>No further clarification of what constitutes "misinformation" was provided.</p>
<p><i>"</i>Disease, Disability, and Injury Prevention and Control" in addition to "Collaborative Surveys to Provide Inputs into Vaccine-Related Economic Evaluations" are among the other topics to be secretly discussed.</p>
<p>Taking place virtually, the meeting is set to occur between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>The secret meeting follows stunning revelations from internal documents from federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the "Twitter Files" showing how the U.S. government has worked behind close doors to censor Americans on social media platform. In addition to censoring debate about election fraud and failures of President Joe Biden such as the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, COVID-19 "misinformation" about the origins of the pandemic and vaccines have also been a primary target of government-backed censors.</p>
<p>The unearthed, secret meeting is the latest example of how federal agencies are colluding to combat alleged "misinformation," despite failing to clearly define what actually qualifies as fact vs. fiction.</p>
