<p>A recent WarRoom discussion between Todd Bensman and Steve Bannon focused on the alarming Biden administration’s late-night push on immigration policies and their implications for the America First movement and the American people, especially in the light of major national security issues and especially when amnesty is the opposite of the people are demanding.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon opened by highlighting public discontent with the administration’s handling of immigration, noting recent polling shows that, “63% of American people, at 53% of Hispanics, want mass deportations.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Both Bannon and Bensman criticized Biden’s most recent amnesty measures as desperate attempts to secure votes from specific demographic groups for the 2024 election.</p>
<p>According to media sources, on Monday night, Biden introduced a new program to grant lawful permanent residency to around 500,000 undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens, marking a significant move in immigration policy during a critical election year. The initiative, known as “parole in place,” allows eligible individuals who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years and are legally married to a U.S. citizen to apply for green cards without leaving the country. This change addresses previous requirements that often separated families for extended periods.</p>
<p>The program also covers about 50,000 children under 21 years old. Participants will initially receive a three-year period to live and work in the U.S. while their applications for permanent residency are processed. This development is part of broader efforts by the Biden administration- they claim to reform immigration policies. Still, they are more likely to appeal to Latino voters amidst ongoing political scrutiny over border issues and immigration policy.</p>
<p>Biden’s “Parole in Place” policy refers to a program that allows certain illegal immigrants who are spouses of U.S. citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency (green cards) without leaving the United States. This initiative primarily benefits individuals who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years and are legally married to a U.S. citizen as of a specified date. It aims to prevent the prolonged separation of families if these individuals were required to leave the country to apply for residency through standard processes.</p>
<p>Participants in the program are initially granted a temporary period to live and work in the U.S. while their applications for permanent residency are processed.</p>
<p>The policy is part of Biden’s broader efforts to reform immigration practices singlehandedly, particularly in addressing issues related to family reunification and providing a pathway to legal status for certain illegals.</p>
<p>Echoing Bannon’s concerns, Bensman criticized the administration’s use of euphemisms like “parole in place” to describe what he sees as amnesty for nearly 579,000 individuals. He argued that these actions are part of broader efforts by progressive elements within the administration to preemptively counter anticipated policy changes if Trump were to win re-election.</p>
<p>The WarRoom discussion turned sharply to national security concerns, with Bensman detailing cases of individuals entering the U.S. under humanitarian parole programs who were later linked to terrorism, citing examples such as Tajik nationals involved in terrorism-related activities and a Jordanian who conducted a thwarted vehicle ramming attack at a military base.</p>
<p>In a recent article, Bensman <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/us-news/house-committee-demands-answer-on-eight-tajik-border-crossers-arrested-for-terror-plot/">reported</a> on the House Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee who are demanding answers from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding the arrest of eight Tajik nationals who crossed the U.S. Southwest Border and were later found to be planning a terrorist bombing.</p>
<p>The suspects, some of whom crossed the border more than a year prior to their arrests, were apprehended by ICE after the FBI alerted them to the suspects’ connection to ISIS. The committee is investigating whether border agencies could have known about the suspects’ terrorism connections when they first crossed and how they were handled after their releases. The committee is also seeking immigration files, communications between the FBI and ICE, and all derogatory information in the terrorist watch list database about the suspects.</p>
<p>Bannon pressed on the implications of these security threats, criticizing media silence and accusing the Biden administration of purposefully neglecting border security issues for political gain. Bensman agreed, emphasizing the danger posed by unchecked immigration policies and the administration’s reluctance to acknowledge the security risks.</p>
<p>Bensman’s work, highlighted on platforms like the Center for Immigration Studies and mainstream media outlets such as the New York Post and Daily Mail, has focused on exposing what he views as the truth behind the administration’s immigration narratives. His analysis draws from his investigative reporting and a deep dive into the implications of current policies.</p>
<p>As the discussion concluded, Bensman reiterated his commitment to bringing attention to these issues through his writing, books, and podcasts, urging the public to stay informed and engaged.</p>
