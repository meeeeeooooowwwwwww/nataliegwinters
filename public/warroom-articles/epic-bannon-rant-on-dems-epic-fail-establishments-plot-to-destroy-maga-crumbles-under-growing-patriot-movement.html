<p>In a fiery 2024 statement, before he had to surrender as a political prisoner to a Federal Correctional facility as a political prisoner, Steve Bannon passionately outlined a vision of political realignment in America, expressing strong confidence in support for MAGA of numerous demographic voting groups and declaring the failure of efforts to suppress the America First movement. Bannon’s comments highlight a belief in a broad coalition forming across racial, economic, and generational lines, poised to deliver significant political victories.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen it, The Democrats understand we are ascendent; we’re bringing it. 50 percent the Black male vote. We’re gonna get overwhelming majority of the Hispanic vote Asian Americans. The White working class the middle class students. People under 29 years old, it’s all coming our way. And they know that that’s why they’re worried. They thought their plan to steal the election, and then to destroy MAGA and destroy Trump, and send Trump to 700 years in prison at bankrupt him, would work.  That was their plan and thereby grind MAGA into the dust is , and it is the biggest single epic fail in American history. They have failed. Because just like in 1775 and 1776 Patriots fought back.  That is the DNA that comes down from the revolutionary generation, that is what they inspired. This generation and other generations all working together, including young people- who hate the Democart’s policies. We’re growing,” Bannon said on the WarRoom to get his audience ready to go and vote in November.</p>
<p>Bannon’s words set a narrative of defiance and resurgence, evoking historical parallels to the American Revolutionary War. Bannon said that just as the patriots of 1775 and 1776 resisted tyranny, today’s MAGA movement is driven by a similar spirit of resistance against overreach by the political establishment.</p>
<p>The comparison vividly paints a picture of a modern struggle for what they see as the true American ideals, suggesting that the spirit of rebellion and the fight for freedom has been rekindled in contemporary political battles.</p>
<p>Bannon’s comments show his belief that the strategies employed by the patriot’s opponents to undermine the MAGA movement and its figurehead, Donald Trump, have backfired.</p>
<p>Bannon discussed how those opponents tried to “steal the election” and destroy the America First movement through legal and financial means- called lawfare- as Democrats hoped for a harsh penalty for Trump.</p>
<p>However, as Bannon highlights, those efforts have failed. Instead, they have invigorated the movement, expanding and consolidating support among diverse voting groups who used to vote for Democrats blindly.</p>
<p>The only thing this plan needs for total victory is for people to make sure they get out and vote in November and complete the plan.</p>
<p>Check out this extraordinary Bannon rant:</p>
