<p>After Democrats and their mainstream media counterparts told us the 2020 election was the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/2020-election-most-secure-history-dhs/">“most secure in history,”</a> The White House is warning of foreign, domestic, and cyber forces attempting to influence the results of the upcoming midterm elections.</p>
<p>The news follows Joe Biden’s Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-guidance-federal-statutes-regarding-voting-methods-and-post">targeting</a> election integrity activists who made similar claims and could lay the groundwork for Democrats to dispute the results of the midterm elections, which Republicans are poised to sweep.</p>

<p><em><strong>“</strong>Top Biden national security officials are tracking multiple threats to the nation's election security infrastructure ahead of the midterms and are set to issue warnings, including in an internal intelligence bulletin this week, according to two people familiar with the matter.</em></p>
<p><em>The bulletin will lay out details of cyber threats posed by China and Russia, as well as other non-state actors, and potential physical threats to election officials in jurisdictions across the country, the people said. The warnings come as the midterm elections near and amid <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/23/mesa-arizona-armed-vigilantes-ballot-drop-box">increasing reports</a> of intimidation at ballot drop boxes. The people requested anonymity to talk freely about sensitive national security and election matters.</em></p>
<p><em>The Department of Justice is set to address several malign influence schemes and alleged criminal activity by non-state actors in a press conference Monday. It's unclear if its announcement and the intelligence bulletin warnings are connected.</em></p>
<p><em>The internal administration concerns about election threats come days after a call was held between federal officials and local law enforcement personnel about the midterms, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Those on the call discussed the potential for violence in response to the spread of false narratives regarding the election process. Officials said election workers, including those working at polling stations, are likely to face threats and harassment from extremists both online and offline, the person familiar with the matter said.</em></p>
