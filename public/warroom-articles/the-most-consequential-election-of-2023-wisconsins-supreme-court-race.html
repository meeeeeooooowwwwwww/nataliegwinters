<p><span>Voter Registration Activist Scott Pressler joins Steve Bannon’s War Room to call on everyone in Wisconsin to vote in the most consequential election of 2023 – the Wisconsin Supreme Court election. Following the retirement of a conservative judge the court faces the prospect of flipping majority conservative to liberal. The left has poured millions into the race and notable figures such as Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and Obama have gotten involved. Pressler has spent the the past several weeks campaigning for Judge Daniel Kelly who is running on a platform of school choice, voter I.D. and pro-2nd Amendment. </span></p>
