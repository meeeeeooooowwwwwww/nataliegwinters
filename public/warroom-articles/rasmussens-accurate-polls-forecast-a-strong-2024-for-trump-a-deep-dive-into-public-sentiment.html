<p>Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Reports appeared on the WarRoom on Saturday with Jack Posobiec. The two discussed the shifting dynamics of the political landscape, focusing on recent polling data and its implications for the upcoming 2024 election. Rasmussen Reports, known for its accuracy in predicting previous elections, plays a significant role in understanding public sentiment, especially amidst the rapid changes in news cycles.</p>
<p>Corporate media has labeled Rasmussen Reports a “far-right pollster,” yet its track record speaks volumes.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We nailed 2016, we nailed 2020,” Mitchell asserted, pointing out that other reputable pollsters like CNN, Bloomberg, and Harvard Harris align with their findings. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This history of accurate predictions lends credibility to Rasmussen’s current analysis and forecasts for the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Mitchell, on Saturday, confidently predicted that Trump would remain a formidable force heading into the 2024 election, especially among independents. “Trump’s numbers are just solidly pretty close to 50,” Mitchell noted, emphasizing the stability of Trump’s support. He pointed out that Trump’s lead remains resilient even with potential shifts in voter sentiment due to media narratives.</p>
<p>Mitchell started the conversation by addressing how the fast-paced media environment impacts public opinion. "It’s really hard to poll on what topic Americans care about most when things are changing this fast,” Mitchell observed. He noted that while the media quickly moves from one story to another, certain events still leave a lasting impression. For instance, the assassination attempt on a key figure, which occurred just days before the Republican National Convention (RNC), contributed to a noticeable shift in polling data.</p>
<p>Mitchell highlighted a significant post-RNC bounce for Trump, which saw his lead over Biden increase from three to eight points. He explained that this bounce could partially be attributed to the assassination attempt, as it drew considerable attention and possibly influenced voter sentiment. “A lot of it could have been the assassination attempt as well,” Mitchell speculated. This observation underscores the complexity of polling in an era where unexpected events can quickly alter public perceptions.</p>
<p>The conversation also got into the media’s portrayal of Kamala Harris and its influence on public opinion. Mitchell pointed out that the media has been attempting to elevate Harris as a formidable candidate, dubbing her as a “female Obama.” However, he argued that this portrayal is misleading. “The media is trying to prop this woman up… but there’s just no way that this woman is beating Donald Trump,” he stated. According to Rasmussen’s polling data, Trump consistently outperforms Harris, with a national lead that stands solidly outside the margin of error.</p>
<p>Mitchell further explained that the so-called “Harris momentum” is more about Democrats rallying around her in Biden’s absence rather than a genuine swing in her favor. Posobiec likened this media hype to promoting “terrible new Disney Star Wars movies” that receive poor audience scores. “The hype that we’re seeing for Kamala Harris right now, is exactly like the hype for one of these terrible new Disney Star Wars movies, right?” Posobiec remarked, emphasizing the discrepancy between media narratives and public opinion.</p>
<p>Rasmussen Reports’ history of accuracy, coupled with Mitchell’s insights into the current political landscape, suggests that while media hype may temporarily sway public perception, the underlying support for Trump remains strong.</p>
