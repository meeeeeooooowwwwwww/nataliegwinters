<p>On June 1, the WarRoom audience was given an interesting surprise when correspondent Megyn Kelly lamented America’s critical position in American politics following the recent guilty verdicts against former President Donald J. Trump.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Kelly, appearing in a cold open, articulated the gravity of the situation, said to her audience, “What just happened today is a line we can’t uncross.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>She accused Democrats of using “lawfare” to thwart a presidential candidate. She called for a tit-for-tat response, emphasizing the need to target prominent Democrats like Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Kelly insisted on behaving as MAGA’s opponents have- by exploring statutes of limitations and potentially reviving past crimes to hold these figures accountable, stating, “Turnabout is fair play.”</p>
<p><strong>SURPRISE!</strong></p>
<p>And then Kelly, after a 9-year-long “beef” with  WarRoom host Steve Bannon over how Kelly treated -then-candidate Donald J. Trump, called for the leadership and “House style” of her nemesis, who had been relentless against her in those days- Steve Bannon.</p>
<p><strong>KELLY SUMMONED THE ‘HONEYBADGER”TO SAVE THE REPUBLIC,  AND HE ANSWERED</strong></p>
<p>Bannon, often nicknamed “the Honey Badger,” earned this moniker due to his tenacious and relentless approach to politics, akin to the fierce and fearless nature of the actual animal. Before his tenure as a White House strategist, Bannon adopted the phrase "Honey badger don’t give a sh8t” as the motto for his media operation, Breitbart News, even having it engraved on flasks as party favors. This phrase encapsulates his unapologetic and uncompromising style. During a 2020 episode of his War Room podcast, Bannon reaffirmed this reputation following his arrest. “I am not going to back down,” he declared. “I was called ‘honey badger’ for many years. You know, ‘Honey badger doesn’t give.’” This attitude shows Bannon’s persistent and combative nature, regardless of the obstacles he faces.</p>
<p>Kelly, of all people, knows these things about Bannon.</p>
<p>In response to the Megyn Kelly cold open, Bannon highlighted the historical context, drawing parallels to the founding generation of the Republic. He emphasized the unity and determination of figures like Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton, and Burr, despite their personal animosities, in fighting the British Empire.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon said, “We have to go Old Testament… we have to build this, we have to do this, but some part of us has to go on offense.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He agreed with Kelly’s call for a more aggressive stance, recognizing that the Democrats’ legal tactics had been effective: “They won on Thursday. We have to embrace that it worked. Lawfare worked.”</p>
<p>Bannon outlined the necessity of a ruthless approach, urging immediate and relentless action. He called for a massive grassroots mobilization, reminiscent of Obama’s 2008 campaign, to engage and persuade the populace directly: “We want 250,000 volunteers and we want them immediately… the strongest thing you have is personal contact.”</p>
<p>Framing the current political struggle as a “season of War,” Bannon asserted the need for urgency and emphasized the critical role of human agency within the MAGA movement to counter Democratic strategies.</p>
<p>He identified three tactics the Democrats would rely on to win the 2024 election if unchecked: “Lawfare, the big steal, and Wag the Dog.”</p>
<p>Bannon argued that these strategies aimed to undermine Trump and his supporters because they couldn’t compete on policy grounds or the program to “restore America.” He stressed the importance of fighting back and understanding the larger battle: “Obviously, we have to be principled but we have to be ruthless. That’s all they understand.”</p>
<p>Bannon criticized current Republican leaders for their performative measures and inaction, calling for genuine, strategic efforts to confront and overturn the Democrats’ moves. He expressed frustration with the Republican Party’s historical failures and the manipulative tactics of conservative media: “I’m sick and tired of strongly worded letters… and raising money on the carcass of Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>He repeatedly echoed Kelly’s sentiments, advocating for an assertive and relentless approach to safeguarding the Republic. He reiterated the need for a grassroots mobilization, emphasizing that this was a pivotal moment requiring immediate and decisive action: “Offense, offense, offense. With a sense of urgency that has to be done today, today, today.”</p>
<p>Bannon is known for his robust response to the current political challenges, advocating for a strategy that combines principled action with relentless determination.</p>
<p>Remember- the three tactics that Steve Bannon identified as the Democrats’ strategies to win the 2024 election, if they are not stopped by the human agency of the MAGA movement, are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lawfare:</strong> Utilizing legal actions and litigation to undermine and challenge their political opponents.</li>
<li><strong>The Big Steal:</strong> Allegations or strategies for manipulating election processes or outcomes to favor Democratic candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Wag the Dog:</strong> Creating diversions or manipulating events to distract from other issues or consolidate support.</li>
</ol>
