<p>According to Brian Kennedy from the Present Danger China organization, the U.S. faces growing threats from Iran and China, which are undermining its global deterrence. He explained on Wednesday’s WarRoom program that voters must be aware of the implications as the 2024 election nears and said that grassroots mobilization is crucial to influencing the future of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<h3>U.S. Policies Fuel Global Instability</h3>
<p>Kennedy warns that current U.S. policies are contributing to global chaos, especially concerning Iran’s aggressions towards Israel. He states, "The United States is helping underwrite the attack on Israel,” pointing out that American funding to Iran indirectly supports these hostilities. This, he argues, isn’t simply a regional issue but part of a broader global challenge that voters must recognize. U.S. leadership, he asserts, is not taking sufficient action to deter Iran, and this failure could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<h3>Failed Deterrence Weakens U.S. Global Standing</h3>
<p>Kennedy emphasizes that the erosion of U.S. deterrence is not limited to the Middle East. He highlights a troubling trend where adversaries, particularly China, do not respect America’s warnings. "Iran does not respect the United States, and neither does China,” he says, underscoring how both countries continue to pursue aggressive policies despite U.S. opposition. This is a direct result of weak leadership, Kennedy argues, leaving the U.S. in a vulnerable position.</p>
<h3>World War III Looms as Real Threat</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most alarming of Kennedy’s warnings is his belief that the world is inching closer to a global conflict. He suggests that the U.S.’s inability to prevent Iran’s provocations could spark a larger confrontation. “This October surprise really could be the start of World War III,” Kennedy cautions. With tensions escalating, particularly in the Middle East, the U.S. may soon face difficult decisions regarding its involvement in new conflicts. Voters need to understand the gravity of the situation as they head to the polls.</p>
<h3>Domestic Unrest Could Escalate</h3>
<p>Kennedy also connects international instability to potential domestic unrest. If U.S. policies lead to increased violence in the Middle East, he warns that it could trigger significant disruptions at home. “Palestinian sympathizers and Iranians in the U.S. could create the kind of street violence we saw in 2020,” Kennedy explains. The implications for national security are significant, as instability abroad could spill over into the U.S., complicating an already fraught political landscape.</p>
<h3>Grassroots Mobilization Is Essential</h3>
<p>As the 2024 election approaches, Kennedy stresses the importance of voter engagement, especially among supporters of former President Donald Trump. He reveals a startling statistic: many Trump supporters are not even registered to vote. “People donate money to President Trump and are not registered to vote,” he states, highlighting the disconnect between political support and electoral participation. He urges voters to mobilize their communities, saying, “This will be fixed by the WarRoom Posse animating family, friends, and neighbors.”</p>
<h3>Why This Matters Now</h3>
<p>Kennedy’s insights underscore the urgent need for American voters to consider the broader implications of U.S. foreign policy. With the U.S.’s global standing weakening and adversaries growing bolder, the stakes for the 2024 election are incredibly high. Weak deterrence, escalating global conflicts, and potential domestic unrest all hinge on the decisions voters make in the coming months.</p>
<h3> 2024 Election Is a Crucial Turning Point</h3>
<p>Kennedy’s message is clear: the future of U.S. leadership and world stability rests on the outcome of the 2024 election. Voters must take action, not only by voting themselves but by ensuring their communities are engaged. The risks of failing to act—both globally and domestically—are too great to ignore. This is a critical moment in history, and the choices made in the voting booth will determine whether the U.S. can reclaim its position as a global leader.</p>
<p>The time to act is now, Kennedy told WarRoom host Ben Harnwell.</p>
