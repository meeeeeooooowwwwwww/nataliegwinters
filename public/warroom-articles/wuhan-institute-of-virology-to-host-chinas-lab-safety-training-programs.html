<p>The Wuhan Institute of Virology â€" believed to be the Chinese lab responsible for birthing the COVID-19 pandemic â€" is hosting training programs on how to safely handle pathogens and animals.</p>
<p>Despite the lab’s poor safety track record and culpability for COVID-19, an October 28th post to its website reveals the upcoming training event: “<a href="https://www.whiov.cas.cn/tzgg_160286/202210/t20221028_6541489.html">Notice</a> on holding advanced training courses on biosafety laboratory management and experimental technology training.”</p>
<p>Set to run from November 15th through 17th, the course is a project of the country’s premier scientific organization, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the regime’s  Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.</p>
<p>The “Biosafety Laboratory Management and Experimental Technology Training Course” will focus on six key areas including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Biosafety laboratory construction and management system;</li>
<li><span>Laboratory biosafety risk assessment methods and key points;</span></li>
<li>Biosafety laboratory key equipment and waste disposal;</li>
<li>Technical specifications for the use, management, transportation and preservation of pathogenic; microorganism (virus) species and samples;</li>
<li>Animal laboratory biosafety management and</li>
<li>Biosafety management of pathogenic microorganism laboratory, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>It seeks to train “domestic practitioners engaged in pathogenic microorganism laboratory management and scientific research activities.”</p>
<p>The event comes amidst America's top health and <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/breaking/dni-ratcliffe-links-covid-to-wiv/">intelligence</a> officials in addition to <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/senate-report-concludes-covid-came-research-related-incident">lawmakers</a> publicly supporting the theory that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, whose safety precautions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/">raised</a> red flags among American diplomats.</p>
<p>Using its Biosafety level<em> 4</em> (BSL-4) facility, the lab manipulated "<a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/06/08/daszak-reveals-chinese-colleagues-manipulating-coronaviruses/">killer</a>" bat coronaviruses to create strains possessing the <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/10/27/wuhan-report-boasted-of-human-infecting-covid/">capacity</a> for "direct human infection.”</p>
