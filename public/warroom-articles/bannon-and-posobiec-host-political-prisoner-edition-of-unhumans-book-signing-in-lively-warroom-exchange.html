<p>In a lively exchange on the WarRoom between Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon on Thursday, the two discussed their special edition of Posobiec’s book, Unhumans, which features a forward by Bannon. As they prepared to sign copies, Bannon jokingly commented, "By the way, I will need a Sharpie here. Of course, if it’s Poso, it’s gotta be some scam associated with him.” Posobiec responded with humor, "Exactly. Poso will monetize anything. No pillows today,” referring to Posobiec’s enthusiasm for pitching his My Pillow Promo code.</p>
<p>Not that the topic is funny.</p>
<p>Today, they were talking about a book that is likely to rattle many people from their comfort zone; check out what the publisher says about the book:</p>
<p><em><b>If you don’t understand communist revolutions, you aren’t ready for what’s coming.</b></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781648210860/unhumans/">PREVIEW BOOK HERE</a></p>
<p>On Thursday, Posobiec clarified their WarRoom activity:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> "Steve Bannon is going to be signing copies of Inhumans because we’re doing a special edition. Can I tell them the edition name? Yes, it’s the Political Prisoner Edition,” Poso said, and then He directed listeners to "unbook.com” to get their copies and highlighted the unique aspect of this signing event, with Bannon saying he never signs books for money, but was making a special case for an upcoming announcement “for a good cause”. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The book will be released on July 2, just one day after Bannon is scheduled to surrender to federal prison over his contempt of Congress charge.</p>
<p>Keeping the mood light and building the mystery, Bannon and Posobiec chose different colors for their signatures, with Bannon opting for black and Posobiec for red. Bannon explained the purpose behind this initiative: "The proceeds of this are going to a good cause to make something culturally relevant. We’ll be able to talk to you about it, the day after it happens, but you are the only reason I would agree to this is that…”</p>
<p>The conversation then shifted to Mike Davis, who had been with Posobiec earlier and who faced harassment at the Supreme Court building. Bannon asked Posobiec about Davis, "Tell me about Mike Davis. Why were they picking on Mike Davis? And how did you, how did you jump in?” As they signed books, the atmosphere remained light-hearted and energetic.</p>
<p>This fun exchange showcased the camaraderie between Posobiec and Bannon as they promoted the Political “Prisoner Edition” of Inhumans. Their humorous banter and commitment to a good cause highlighted the unique nature of this book signing event, just days ahead of the beginning of Bannon’s prison sentence.</p>

<p>More from the Publisher about Unhumans:</p>
<p><em>The old rules are over. The old order is over. Accusations are evidence. Activism means bigotry and hate. Criminals are allowed to roam free. Citizens are locked up. An appetite for vengeance is unleashed—to deplatform, debank, destroy. This is the daily news, yet none of it’s new. Patterns from the past make sense of our present. They also foretell a terrifying future we might be condemned to endure.</em></p>
<p><em>For nearly 250 years, far-left uprisings have followed the same battle plans—from the first call for change to last innocent executed, from denial a revolution is even happening to declaration of the new order. Unhumans takes readers on a shocking, sweeping, and succinct journey through history to share the untold stories of radical takeovers that textbooks don’t teach.</em></p>
<p><em>And there is one conclusion: We’re in a new revolution right now.</em></p>
<p><em>But this is not a book about ideology or politics. Unhumans reveals that communism, socialism, Marxism, and all other radical-isms are not philosophies but tactics—tactics that are specifically designed to unleash terror on everyday people and revoke their human rights to life, liberty, and property. These are the forces of unhumanity. This is what they do. Every. Single. Time. Unhumans steals their playbook, breaks apart their strategies piece by piece, and lays out the tactics of what it takes to fight back—and win, using real-world examples.</em></p>
<p><em>Unhumans is the essential read for every concerned citizen both of the US and worldwide. We must stop what is coming.</em></p>
<p>According to Skyhorse Publishing, “Unhumans” by Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec explores the untold stories of radical takeovers often overlooked in traditional education. The book explores the concepts of communism, socialism, and Marxism as tactics that threaten human rights and aim to instill fear among ordinary people. Posobiec analyzes these strategies, offering real-world examples and techniques to resist and overcome such ideologies.</p>
<p>Bannon and Posobiec also discussed the book in great detail at the People’s Convention in Detroit in mid-June, and Bannon provided some in-depth insights on various topics.</p>
<p>During this exchange, Bannon said the Summer of 2024 is the “The Summer of Fight” and went into detail about his concept of “Next Man Up” as he is about to be imprisoned for the remaining election season for a misdemeanor.</p>
