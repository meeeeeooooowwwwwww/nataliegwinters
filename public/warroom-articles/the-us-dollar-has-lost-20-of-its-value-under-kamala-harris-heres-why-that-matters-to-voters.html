<p><strong>According to economic experts, The Biden-Harris administration’s economic policies have eroded the value of the US dollar by 20% since 2020. This inflation crisis directly impacts voters’ wallets, wages, and savings, making it a pivotal issue for the November election. Voters must take this seriously in November.</strong></p>
<h3>Inflation Has Eaten Away at the Dollar</h3>
<p>On Monday, EJ Antoni appeared on the WarRoom program and emphasized a critical point: "The dollar has lost a fifth of its value since Biden-Harris took office.” This shocking 20% loss is directly tied to the administration’s reckless fiscal policies, including multi-trillion-dollar deficits and unchecked government spending.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-inflation/">Inflation</a> has hit American households hard. Groceries, gas, rent—all have become more expensive, eroding the dollar’s purchasing power. According to Antoni, even the government’s metrics, which understate inflation, show a significant decline in the dollar’s value. "This is where the government has gotten all the money to pay for its runaway spending,” Antoni explained. Inflation acts as a hidden tax, and voters are paying the price.</p>
<h3>Voters Are Feeling the Pinch</h3>
<p>Why does this matter for voters heading to the polls in November? The value of your wages, savings, and investments has been slashed. As inflation continues to rise, everyday necessities are becoming increasingly unaffordable. Many Americans are left wondering how they’ll maintain their standard of living if the dollar keeps losing value.</p>
<p>The erosion of the dollar is not just an abstract economic concept—it’s a kitchen table issue. Families struggle with higher costs while their incomes fail to keep pace. "We are all demonstrably poorer because of the policies of this administration,” Antoni stated. This growing financial strain has voters reconsidering their political choices.</p>
<h3>Harris’s Policies Are Driving Economic Pain</h3>
<p>The root cause of this crisis? The Biden-Harris administration’s fiscal irresponsibility. The two-plus trillion-dollar deficits each year are driving inflation and devaluing the dollar. "Biden and Harris are running $2 trillion deficits right now,” Bannon noted. The government’s excessive borrowing and spending are unsustainable and detrimental to Americans’ financial well-being.</p>
<p>Adding to this, the job market is suffering. Many of the jobs created during Harris’s term have gone to illegal workers or are part-time positions. Antoni pointed out that “all net job growth since before the pandemic has gone to illegal workers,” leaving many Americans sidelined in the job market. This further exacerbates the economic pain felt by working-class families.</p>
<h3>What Voters Should Consider in November</h3>
<p>As voters head to the polls, they should reflect on the past four years of economic hardship. Inflation, wage stagnation, and a weakened dollar are all the direct results of misguided fiscal policies. The erosion of the US dollar means that voters’ wages and savings are worth less now than before Harris took office.</p>
<p>This is a critical issue for voters to consider in November. The question is simple: Can you afford another four years of policies that are shrinking your paycheck and making it harder to make ends meet?</p>
<p>In a nation built on financial freedom and opportunity, the dollar’s loss of value threatens the core of the American Dream.</p>
