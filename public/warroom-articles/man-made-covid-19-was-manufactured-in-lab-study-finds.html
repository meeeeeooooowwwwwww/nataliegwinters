<p>COVID-19 is likely a “man-made” virus that traces its origins to a laboratory, according to a new report from researchers in the U.S. and Germany.</p>
<p>The study is the latest blow to the Chinese Communist Party-concocted narrative that COVID-19 developed naturally in a wet market, which has been amplified by Western scientists with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>It also follows the unearthing of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s <a href="https://thenationalpulse.com/2021/05/15/wuhan-lab-erases-nih-ties-gof-research/">work</a> on bat coronaviruses, which included the Chinese Communist Party-run laboratory using U.S. taxpayer dollars to manipulate coronavirus strains to become deadlier to humans.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Mail </em>reports:</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html">coronavirus</a> was likely made in a lab, according to the latest explosive study to shed light on the possible origins of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Researchers in the US and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/germany/index.html">Germany</a> studied Covid’s genome — the virus’ instruction manual — and compared it to dozens of previously detected coronaviruses.</p>
<p>‘Peculiar patterns’ were visible in the building blocks of the pandemic-causing virus, which they say are hallmark signs that it was manufactured. The team described it as having a ‘synthetic fingerprint’.</p>
<p>Study author Dr Alex Washburne, a mathematical biologist, said the lab leak theory can’t be ruled out based on the results of his controversial study.</p>
<p>Each test his team performed ‘decreased the odds of SARS-CoV-2 having a natural origin’, he said.</p>
<p>However, Dr Washburne noted his team don’t identify which lab that was the source of the outbreak and insisted that the virus looks more ‘like an accident’ rather than a ‘bioweapon’.</p>
<p>Some experts called the results ‘troubling’ and claimed they offered the ‘strongest piece of evidence’ yet that the virus was man-made.</p>
