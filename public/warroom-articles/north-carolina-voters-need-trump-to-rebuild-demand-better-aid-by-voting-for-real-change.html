<p><strong>Get to the polls this November if you want to see real aid, real solutions, and real action for North Carolina. Catherine Engelbrecht’s conversation with Ben Harnwell highlights the critical need for leadership that delivers during crises, not just talks.</strong></p>
<h3>Aid Delays: Why North Carolina Needs to Take Action</h3>
<p>Catherine Engelbrecht with <a href="https://truethevote.org/">True the Vote</a>, appeared on Tuesday WarRoom, speaking from the heart of North Carolina, emphasized that voters need to demand more from their leaders. After Hurricane Helene, aid was slow, communication was weak, and citizens were left to fend for themselves. "We’re here installing radios to boost the Starlink signal,” Engelbrecht said, as she and her team worked to restore communication in the most devastated regions. But why are citizens being forced to step up when government should be taking the lead?</p>
<p>It’s time to elect leaders who can handle emergencies and bring tangible solutions to the table. Engelbrecht’s frustration echoed the sentiments of many: "These people want to vote—they want to make sure their voices are heard.” Voters should be asking themselves: Are our current leaders really delivering?</p>
<h3>Voter Confidence is Shaky—Here’s Why It Shouldn’t Be</h3>
<p>The storm didn’t just bring physical destruction; it also raised questions about voter access. Engelbrecht noted that despite the damage, election officials are trying to ensure the voting process remains intact. "There’s a real stress on making sure people feel confident they can vote,” she stated. But confidence is fragile when basic services like communication are lagging.</p>
<p>Engelbrecht urged voters to take action: "These people would walk across broken glass to make sure their vote counts.” The time to demand better is now—by showing up at the polls, North Carolinians can hold their leaders accountable for their lackluster response to crises.</p>
<h3>Trump: The Builder North Carolina Needs</h3>
<p>As the conversation with Harnwell unfolded, the discussion turned to leadership. Engelbrecht made it clear that North Carolina deserves leaders who prioritize rebuilding and recovery. Enter President Trump. Known as a builder, Trump has a track record of revitalizing struggling communities and delivering practical solutions. Engelbrecht pointed out that under stronger leadership, delays in aid and services wouldn’t be the norm.</p>
<p>"If the ballots had been damaged, how would they make up the time?” she asked, highlighting the ongoing incompetence that has plagued the state’s response efforts. This November, voters have a chance to choose a leader who understands infrastructure and logistics. As Trump has often said, “I build things,” and that’s exactly what North Carolina needs.</p>
<h3>True the Vote: Keeping Elections Fair</h3>
<p>Engelbrecht’s organization, True the Vote, is on the ground to ensure election integrity, and her team is monitoring the situation closely. "We’re here to help shore up the process,” she said, pointing to her team’s work across battleground states like North Carolina, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The message is clear: every vote matters, and voters need to make their voices heard to avoid a repeat of the current mess.</p>
<h3>This November, Your Vote Can Bring Real Change</h3>
<p>Voters in North Carolina have the power to demand better leadership. Engelbrecht’s insights should serve as a wake-up call for anyone left behind during recent disasters. Don’t wait for the next storm to hit—vote for leaders who will deliver real aid, real solutions, and real results.</p>
