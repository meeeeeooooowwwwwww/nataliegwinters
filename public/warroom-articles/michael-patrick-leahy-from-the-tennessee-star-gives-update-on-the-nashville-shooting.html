<p><span>Michael Patrick Leahy editor-in-chief and CEO of the Star News Network of the "Tennessee Star” joins Steve Bannon’s War Room to discuss the tragic shooting that claimed several lives at a Nashville Christian school. </span></p>
<p><span>"The shootings took place at 10:13 this morning at Covenant Presbyterian School, that’s a K-6 Christian school about a mile and a half from our studios here… Police have confirmed a 28 year old woman entered the school from a side door that apparently was open, had 2 assault riffles and a gun, and began shooting. 14 minutes later the police were there and shot the shooter dead. There are 6 dead other than the shooter.” </span></p>
