<p>In a recent discussion, policy expert George Pond shed light on a concerning geopolitical scenario through the lens of fiction and current events. Pond, who is deeply involved in policy work and a friend of Dr. Richard Funk, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cartel-Wars-Consequences-Americas-Border/dp/B0D9549MH5">Cartel Wars</a>, explained how this fictional novel mirrors the real and imminent threats posed by the alliance between Chinese interests and Mexican cartels.</p>
<p>Cartel Wars is not just a work of fiction but a reflection of growing anxieties about national security. The novel, penned by Dr. Funk, envisions a scenario where Chinese-backed Mexican cartels orchestrate an invasion of the United States, specifically targeting Texas. This invasion, depicted in the book, sees Austin fall and highlights the resilience of Americans who ultimately push back against the threat. Pond shared insights about the book’s relevance, noting, "The book captures the essence of what could happen if we remain complacent about the growing threat from these alliances.”</p>
<p>Pond’s discussion on the WarRoom with Lara Logan on Thursday tied the fictional narrative to real-world concerns, particularly the implications of open border policies and the strategic manipulations of adversarial nations. He drew parallels between the novel’s portrayal of a Mexican cartel invasion and recent global developments. "When I saw the events unfold in Israel, it was a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are,” Pond remarked, referring to the surprise attacks on Israel and comparing them to potential threats facing the U.S.</p>
<p>The conversation also touched on the bigger issues of such alliances for American security. Pond described how the Mexican cartels, in collaboration with China, could exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. border security and infrastructure. He emphasized that this collaboration is a theoretical threat and an evolving reality. "We have been under an invasion for a long time,” Pond asserted, highlighting the ongoing issues of drug warfare, human trafficking, and smuggling that are already affecting American communities.</p>
<p>Pond further elaborated on the strategic aspects of these threats, noting how China has used its partnership with Mexican cartels to establish a de facto "Silk Road” into the United States.</p>
<p>"The Chinese have weaponized Mexican cartels and used them as proxies in their unrestricted warfare against the U.S.,” Pond explained, illustrating how this alliance could undermine American security from within.</p>
<p>The discussion also delved into how this situation intersects with current geopolitical tensions, particularly the risk of broader conflicts involving China. Pond warned of the potential for increased aggression, noting, "We could be on the brink of a major war if tensions with China escalate, especially given the current geopolitical climate.”</p>
<p>Pond’s insights into Cartel Wars and its real-world implications serve as a call to action for policymakers and citizens alike. "Understanding and addressing these risks are crucial for safeguarding national security and preparing for potential future conflicts,” Pond concluded, reinforcing the need for vigilance in the face of these evolving challenges.</p>
