<p>Matthew Taylor, the Director of Government Gangsters, provided an in-depth look into the much-anticipated film and its upcoming release. During his discussion, Taylor highlighted the critical nature of the film, which delves into the deep state’s grip on American politics and its implications on justice and governance.</p>
<p>Taylor announced that the premiere of Government Gangsters will take place at the Miller High Life Theater during the RNC on Thursday, July 18 at 3:00 PM. This premiere is a significant event, providing attendees with the first opportunity to view this revealing documentary. The premiere aims to bring together individuals who are keen on understanding the intricate details of how career bureaucrats, whom the film refers to as "government gangsters,” have infiltrated various U.S. government agencies, perpetuating corruption and wielding considerable influence.</p>
<p>Watch a Trailer <a href="https://warroom.film/">HERE</a></p>
<p>Taylor stressed the importance of this film on the Monday WarRoom program, which is based on Kash Patel’s book Government Gangsters. Patel, who played a crucial role as the lead investigator in Russiagate and co-authored the Nunes Memo with Devin Nunes, provides an insider’s perspective on the machinations of the deep state. The film meticulously documents the last eight years of Donald Trump’s battles against these entrenched interests, highlighting key events such as Russiagate, the 51 Intel letter, and the ongoing struggles against deep state operatives.</p>
<p>For those unable to attend the RNC premiere, Taylor revealed that the film will be available to the public starting Friday, July 19. He encouraged everyone to visit warroom.film to preorder the film. This website offers the option to preorder and features a trailer and a personal video message from Steve Bannon, recorded before his incarceration, providing further insights into the film’s significance.</p>
<p>Taylor explained that preordering the film is crucial for several reasons. First, it ensures that viewers are among the first to receive and watch the documentary upon its release. Second, preordering supports the filmmakers’ mission to disseminate this critical information widely. Taylor emphasized that this film is not just a documentary but a call to action for Americans to understand the depth of corruption within the government and hold accountable those responsible for undermining democratic processes.</p>
<p>Throughout his discussion, Taylor acknowledged the challenges faced during the production of Government Gangsters. He pointed out that there has been significant resistance from various quarters, particularly from the media and governmental agencies implicated in the film. Despite these challenges, the production team, including Steve Bannon, has persevered, driven by a commitment to uncovering and exposing the truth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Taylor’s comments underscore the importance of Government Gangsters as a pivotal documentary that sheds light on the deep state’s influence in American politics. He urged everyone to attend the premiere at the RNC if possible, preorder the film at <a href="https://warroom.film/">warroom.film</a>, and watch the public release on July 19. This film promises to be an eye-opener, revealing the extent of bureaucratic corruption and calling for accountability and transparency in government operations.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>From the producers about the film: </strong></p>
<p><strong>From Steve Bannon and the visionary team behind "Clinton Cash” comes to a groundbreaking new exposé that will leave you on the edge of your seat. "Government Gangsters,” based on the best-selling book by Former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Kash Patel, pulls back the curtain on the sinister world of corrupt bureaucrats, government oligarchs, and their media accomplices as they conspired to bring down a sitting President, Donald J.Trump,and all those who support him.This explosive film uncovers the depths of deceit and manipulation they employ daily,betraying the very system they vowed to protect. "Government Gangsters” is not just a film—it’s a revelation that will forever alter your perception of government. May we never need another film like this again. </strong></p></blockquote>
