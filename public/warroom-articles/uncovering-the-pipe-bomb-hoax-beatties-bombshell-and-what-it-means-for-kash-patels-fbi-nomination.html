<p><strong>Revolutions in Reporting: Beattie’s Investigations and the Need for Kash Patel’s Leadership at the FBI</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/DarrenJBeattie">Darren Beattie</a>’s investigative work at <a href="https://revolver.news/newsfeed/">Revolver News</a> has illuminated one of the most controversial aspects of the January 6 Capitol riot: the pipe bomb incident. His relentless investigation has uncovered what he believes to be a series of deliberate and suspicious actions by federal agencies, raising questions about the integrity of the government’s narrative.</p>
<p>Beattie appeared on Thursday’s WarRoom to give an update to his work:</p>
<p>On the WarRoom with Steve Bannon, Beattie argues that the government’s handling of the January 6 events, particularly the pipe bombs, was not just flawed—it was a coordinated effort to mislead the public. This perspective has placed Beattie at the center of a growing movement of skeptical Americans who are beginning to question the official story. His reporting on the pipe bomb investigation has been groundbreaking, and it has made him a key figure in the effort to uncover what happened that day.</p>
<p><strong>A Timeline of Inconsistent Investigations: The Pipe Bomb Cover-Up</strong></p>
<p>Beattie’s <a href="https://revolver.news/?s=Pipe+Bomb">deep dive into the pipe bomb investigation for Revolver News</a> paints a picture of an investigation that was shut down prematurely. According to his research, the FBI initially conducted a thorough investigation into the bombs that were discovered near the Capitol on January 6, 2021. However, something went wrong around May of 2021, when the investigation mysteriously went dark. Beattie describes this as a significant turning point—one that raised alarm bells for him and other investigators. The FBI, after initially chasing leads and reviewing surveillance footage, essentially abandoned the case. Beattie’s reporting suggests that the FBI, at least in the early months after January 6, was on the trail of key evidence but was either obstructed or ordered to halt its efforts.</p>
<p>The fact that the investigation died down so early is especially troubling for Beattie. Not only does it imply that critical leads were ignored, but it also casts doubt on the entire narrative surrounding the pipe bombs. To Beattie, the lack of progress in the investigation signals that the FBI may have been involved in a deliberate cover-up. He even claims that other agencies, like the ATF and Secret Service, were complicit in suppressing evidence. This raises questions about the involvement of higher government officials, something that Beattie argues could have been orchestrated at the very top of the administration.</p>
<p><strong>Trump’s Role in the Investigation</strong></p>
<p>Beattie’s work has also drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly commented on the issues surrounding January 6. Trump’s statements have supported much of Beattie’s findings, particularly his assertion that the FBI already knows who planted the bombs. Trump has gone further to suggest that the real story behind the pipe bombs is far more damning than anyone in government wants to admit. Beattie believes that Trump’s involvement is crucial, as his statements validate the research and point to the more significant issue of government cover-ups.</p>
<p>The public nature of Trump’s comments has helped amplify the concerns raised by Beattie and others in the investigative community. Trump has long been a critic of the FBI and the broader intelligence community, and his vocal support for Beattie’s findings has only intensified scrutiny of the investigation. Beattie notes that Trump’s focus on the pipe bombs signals that the former president is aware of the more profound implications of this issue. By speaking out, Trump is acknowledging that what happened on January 6 was not a spontaneous insurrection but rather a planned operation involving multiple government agencies.</p>
<p><strong>The Call for Kash Patel’s Leadership</strong></p>
<p>For Beattie, the solution to this investigation’s deadlock lies in the leadership of Kash Patel, a former aide to President Trump and a staunch critic of the FBI’s handling of several high-profile cases. Patel has become a symbol of hope for many who want to see justice in the investigation of January 6. Beattie is hopeful that if Patel is confirmed as the next FBI director, the final pieces of the puzzle will be put together. Patel has the experience and integrity needed to oversee a thorough investigation into the events of that day.</p>
<p>Beattie believes that Patel’s leadership would signal a turning point in the FBI’s case handling. According to Beattie, Patel’s appointment would be crucial in uncovering the truth behind the pipe bombs and the broader January 6 narrative. He argues that the FBI’s previous inaction and possible involvement in a cover-up can only be addressed under Patel’s direction. Beattie also notes that Patel’s history of standing up to the establishment makes him the ideal person to challenge the deep state’s influence over key investigations.</p>
<p><strong>The Broader Implications: A Systemic Problem</strong></p>
<p>Beattie’s investigation into the pipe bombs is not just about exposing a cover-up—it’s about understanding the broader implications for American democracy. Beattie argues that the pipe bomb incident is just one piece of a much larger puzzle involving corruption and manipulation at the highest levels of government. The investigation can potentially expose systemic problems within the FBI, the ATF, and even the Secret Service, which have all played roles in maintaining a false narrative about January 6.</p>
<p>Beattie’s work ties the pipe bomb incident directly to the narrative surrounding the Capitol riot. He insists that the pipe bombs were planted as part of a coordinated effort to escalate the situation and justify the government’s response. For Beattie, the ultimate goal is not just to uncover the truth but to hold those responsible accountable.</p>
