<p>During some on-air comments for CNN, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe recently expressed deep concern among intelligence community members about the potential repercussions of a second Trump term. McCabe, now a CNN analyst, discussed this atmosphere of fear on “The Source” with Kaitlan Collins on Thursday, suggesting that many officials believe Trump would seek retribution against his political enemies. He mentioned discussions among former colleagues about possibly leaving the country to avoid unconstitutional detainment.</p>
<p>In contrast, Steve Bannon responded to McCabe’s concerns on the War Room on Saturday by emphasizing a commitment to the US Constitution and the rule of law, aiming to deconstruct and reform the administrative state.</p>
<p>Bannon reminded his audience that it is the MAGA movement that wants to end the usurpations and power grabs by the US government.</p>
<p>Bannon said then that his approach to reforms and the rule of law centers on adherence to constitutional principles. He assured that “everything that’s going to be done is going to be done… by the Constitution under the rule of law.”</p>
<p>A key aspect of Bannon’s vision for the America First agenda when President Trump returns to DC is the deconstruction of the administrative state.  Bannon told his audience that many agencies, including the FBI and DOJ, have operated without proper authorization for decades.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bannon stated, “We’re going to deconstruct this because most of this ,90%… ,has not been authorized… Number one process in taking apart the administrative stateis the authorizations.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights a critical component of Bannon’s reform agenda: ensuring that federal agencies are properly authorized and accountable to the law.</p>
<p>Addressing McCabe’s concerns, Bannon did not mince words. “McCabe’s got to understand they should be worried. They should be very worried,” he declared. He emphasized that the fear expressed by McCabe and others is justified, given their knowledge of the laws they may have broken. Bannon assured that any actions taken would be legal and constitutional, leveraging existing extradition treaties to ensure justice is served if anyone does flee the USA.</p>
<p>“We have extradition treaties with virtually every country in the world. And you go ahead and run and run as far as you want. We’re going to come and get you and it’s going to be constitutional and by the rule of law,” he said.</p>
<p>Bannon further criticized McCabe and others as part of the “deep state,” an entrenched group within the government that he claims has acted against the country’s interests. He contrasted this with the Trump movement’s stance against unconstitutional practices such as warrantless searches.</p>
<p>“We don’t want warrantless searches. We don’t want warrantless oversight of progressives or people in this country. If you’re an American citizen, we’re fighting for that,” Bannon asserted, positioning the Trump movement as defenders of civil liberties.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Bannon predicted that accountability would begin once Trump resumes office. He emphasized that justice would be pursued lawfully and constitutionally, stating, “The long arm of American justice is going to get you and have you come back. Judgment Day is five November of this year. Accountability day starts on the afternoon of the 20th of January after Donald John Trump takes his hand off the King James Bible. Okay, and we go to work.”</p>
<p>Contrastingly, former FBI special agent Nicole Parker criticized McCabe’s stance, suggesting it represents a faction within the FBI that has misused authority for political purposes. She emphasized that most FBI employees are committed to their oath and would welcome reforms under a new administration.</p>
<p>While McCabe’s comments reflect significant anxiety within the intelligence community, Bannon’s response shows a commitment to constitutional reform and accountability.</p>
<p>By advocating for lawful and authorized governance, Bannon aims to address these concerns and implement substantial changes within the federal administration.</p>
