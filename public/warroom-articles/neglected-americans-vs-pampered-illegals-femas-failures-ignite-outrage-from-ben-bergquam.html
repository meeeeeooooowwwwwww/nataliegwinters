<p>While hurricane-ravaged Appalachia is left out in the cold illegal migrants live comfortably in taxpayer-funded hotels, sparking fury over government priorities.</p>
<p>Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam called out the former Biden administration on Friday’s WarRoom for its stark neglect of disaster-stricken Americans in Appalachian communities while lavishing care on illegal immigrants. Their remarks paint a damning picture of government incompetence and misplaced priorities.</p>
<p>Watch a quick clip of the discussion:</p>
<h3>Four Months, Little Progress</h3>
<p>In Western North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, many hurricane victims are still living in tents through a brutal winter. FEMA’s response? Almost nonexistent. Bergquam noted that FEMA representatives are scarce, and their assistance—when it happens—moves at a snail’s pace. "Four months in, and they’ve set up only five trailers,” one local commissioner shared.</p>
<p>Instead of quick relief, the community has relied on grassroots efforts. Bergquam highlighted local organizations and churches stepping up where FEMA has failed. "This has all been donation-driven,” he said.</p>
<h3>"Rebuilding Ukraine Faster Than Appalachia”</h3>
<p>The most searing critique came from Bergquam, who compared the administration’s priorities: "They’re rebuilding Ukraine faster than they’re rebuilding parts of Appalachia.” His remarks underscored the glaring disparity between international aid and domestic disaster relief.</p>
<p>Bannon chimed in, asking why FEMA’s usual presence was missing. "In California, FEMA is wall-to-wall. Where are they here? No jackets, no vehicles, no boots on the ground,” he pressed. The locals answered plainly: FEMA has abandoned them.</p>
<h3>Hotel Rooms for Illegals, Tents for Americans</h3>
<p>The contrast is jarring. Bergquam reported live from a newly renovated Chicago hotel packed with illegal immigrants. These individuals enjoy warm rooms, three meals a day, cash cards, and other benefits—all courtesy of American taxpayers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, disaster victims in Appalachia struggle to survive in freezing temperatures. "It’s animal-like conditions,” Bannon exclaimed. Bergquam noted the irony: "Joe Biden and the Democrats abandoned these people but rolled out the red carpet for an organized invasion of illegals.”</p>
<h3>A Political Turning Point?</h3>
<p>Bergquam credited President Trump’s decision to visit these devastated areas as a sign of leadership. "President Trump puts America First,” he said. Trump’s visit and his team’s efforts aim to spotlight these forgotten communities.</p>
<p>The Biden administration, however, continues to face criticism for prioritizing border crises over its constitutional duty to protect American citizens. As Bergquam put it, "The government’s primary job is to protect its citizens—not to aid an invasion.”</p>
<p>The sharp divide between the treatment of hurricane victims and illegal immigrants highlights deep flaws in the administration’s priorities. While citizens suffer in tents, migrants enjoy taxpayer-funded luxury. The question remains: When will American leaders prioritize their own people?</p>
