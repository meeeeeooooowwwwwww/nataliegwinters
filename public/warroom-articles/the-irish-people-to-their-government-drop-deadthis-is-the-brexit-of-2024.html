<p>On Thursday, President Joe Biden launched a new phase of his war on the American people in his State of the Union Address.  There is no telling how much more damage the administration will inflict before the American people get a chance to vote on November 5, 2024.  On Friday, across the Atlantic, the Irish people had a chance to vote.  They gave a riposte in the war global elites have waged against the Irish, and the people of the West more broadly.  The Irish voted in two referenda, the so-called Care and Family referenda, regarding proposed changes to the 1937 Constitution.  The elite, including all major political parties, Fianna Fail, Fine Gael, Labour, Greens, and Sinn Fein, as well as the major Irish media, including state broadcaster RTE, and NGOs backed by the government and globalists.</p>
<p>The clauses to Article 40 and 41 of the Constitution related to protect marriage, the Care referendum, and the position of women in the home, the Family referendum.  The elite had proposed changes the "modernize” the Constitution by altering the language of these Articles.  The governments changes were seen as an effort to attack Irish identity, history, position of women, and the family.  In a victory for the Irish people, the Care referendum was rejected by about 74 percent of the vote and the Family referendum by about 68 percent.  The two "No” votes represent the highest and third-highest percentage "No” votes in Irish history (the second was 73.1 percent in the 2015 referendum to allow people as young as 21 to run for Irish president).  Since the adoption of the 1937 Constitution, the public has been asked to vote on 40 Constitutional amendments, 11 of which were rejected before these.  Irish government officials admitted that they "misjudged the mood of the electorate.”  Indeed, and it has not just been on these issues, but also on immigration given the popular protests witnessed in November 2023, sparked in that instance by an Algerian immigrant living in Dublin who attacked three children and an adult.  Given the mood of Irish electorate, the Irish government should thank their lucky stars that they do not have an election this year.</p>
<p>The ”No” votes are significant as they are a harbinger of political change driven by the people.  Just as the 2016 Brexit vote indicated that the people will act to preserve their rights and sovereignty in the face of the globalist elite agenda.  These votes show that 2024 has the potential to be more significant for the 2024 popular agenda than was 2016.</p>
<p>Moreover, as with Brexit, there was a popular mechanism to check the power of the elite:  a referendum.  The elite had to ask the people in referenda and were soundly defeated, as the UK government did for Brexit.  That is a key lesson for the global elite, avoid holding a referendum but work through subterfuge including the EU, NGOs, and the media continue to bypass the people as the Irish elite, just as they are doing on immigration.  The elite narrative will now shift and economic and normative pressure will be brought to bear against Ireland for voting incorrectly.</p>
<p>Another lesson for the elite is to accelerate their efforts at population change.  In the wake of the June 1953 East German people’s uprising against the tyranny of the East German government and Soviet occupation, Bertolt Brecht wrote in his poem "The Solution.” In it, Brecht wondered—given that the East German government stated that the people had forfeit the confidence of the government—if it would not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another.  The hatred that the East German government had for its people is echoed in the U.S. in Biden’s State of the Union.  It is also seen in his insouciance and contempt for the people of East Palestine, Ohio, the open U.S. northern and southern borders, and the well over 300,000 that Biden has flown into the U.S.  In Europe, this hatred is widespread through endless permanent immigration into Europe.  No doubt the "temporary” port the U.S. is constructing off of Gaza, once completed, will be the medium to import many, many thousands of Gazans into Europe, Canada, and the U.S.</p>
<p>The actions of the Irish government to do all they can to replace the Irish people is replicated throughout Western Europe.  What Brecht captured is realized today, just as it was under Soviet tyranny.  For the Irish government, the Irish people have lost the confidence of the government and need to be supplanted.</p>
<p>But the Irish people still get a vote, as do Americans.  2024 will be epochal year for elections around the world.  The elections in Taiwan in January demonstrated that Taiwan values its freedoms and will resist the People’s Republic of China’s efforts to conquer them.  This month, the shock delivered to the Irish elite is as great as the shock given in 2016 by the British people to their elites.  Ireland delivered the equivalent of Brexit 2024 and showed that the Irish people will resist.  Likely in autumn, the British people will deliver a resounding defeat to British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s globalist CINO (Conservative in Name Only) government, which lamentably will return Labour under Sir Keir Starmer to power.  Also this autumn, the American people will have the opportunity to vote for a populist conservative government under Donald Trump.  Every effort will be made by globalists to prevent a Trump victory, but the Irish vote shows that popular discontent against the political elite is profoundly deep, broad, and incandescent.  There is still time to turn Brecht on his head and have the people elect a new government.</p>
