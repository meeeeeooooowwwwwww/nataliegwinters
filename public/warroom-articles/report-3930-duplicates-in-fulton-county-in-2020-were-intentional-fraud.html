<p>A new analysis of nearly 4,000 duplicates counted in Fulton County, Georgia reveals they were deliberately and fraudulently added into the 2020 Election results.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://app.box.com/s/0jtptuq49jtnd20m18kuj0rn2lm5r9hm"><span>report</span></a>, released Monday by software developer Phillip Davis, found a total of 11,873 duplicates, missing, or new ballots differing from the two machine counts, more than the entire election margin alone.</p>
<p>The 3,930 duplicates in Fulton, increased from the 3,125 originally discovered in the Kevin Moncla and Joseph Rossi complaint, have a distinct pattern showing they were not included in the results by accident.</p>
<p>
Davis gave expert analysis earlier this month at the Georgia State Election Board meeting, when Moncla and Rossi were finally given an opportunity to rebut <a href="https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/"><span>the false claims</span></a> made by the Secretary of State’s office, which tried to dismiss their complaint regarding over 20,000 unsubstantiated ballots in the certified results. Davis alluded to the pattern of the duplicate ballots, which he now released to the public.</p>
<p>"382 Absentee Ballots from Tabulator 791 were scrambled together to create double counted ballots in Tabulator 794,” Davis explains. To accomplish this, ballots were placed into the scanner upside down to reverse their order. This pattern, where ballots that were already scanned were taken to create new batches and turned upside down to reverse their order, repeats over and over. All of the duplicate ballots were counted, contrary to Secretary of State general counsel Charlene McGowan’s false claim it was "inconclusive.”</p>
<p>Moncla and Rossi say this verified evidence the duplicate scanning was intentional.</p>
<p>"The basis for this ‘shuffling’ was to conceal the fact that ballots were being scanned twice,” Moncla and Rossi wrote in a 69-page <span>supplemental factual response</span> submitted to the State Election Board and members of the state legislature on July 22. "The creation of new batches of ballots from many different batches was an effort to conceal their unlawful actions.”</p>
<p>"Let us be very clear, the results for the Fulton County General Election Recount were intentionally manipulated by a fraudulent and unlawful process designed to avoid detection and conceal the unlawful acts,” they wrote. "The duplicates at issue were not the result of mistake or honest human error, but intentional, bonafide election fraud.”</p>
<p>Moncla and Rossi’s factual response refutes five major false claims made by the state and Fulton County during the May 7 Board hearing attempting to sweep their complaint under the rug. [Read the full response here <a href="https://warroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KM-Ammended_Factual_Response.pdf">KM-Ammended_Factual_Response</a>.]</p>
<p>The majority of the duplicates, 2,015, came from tabulator 816, the same tabulator McGowan’s investigators blamed for why Fulton County was over 17,000 votes short during the recount. While 816 was <a href="https://warroom.org/how-georgia-was-stolen/"><span>not the reason</span></a> for the shortfall, its results were manipulated. Hundreds of in-person votes were rescanned upside down to create duplicates on the same machine.</p>
<p>Ballots from tabulator 805 were also duplicated and inserted into tabulator 816’s results. Ballot images from 805 and 816 were both deleted. In fact, tabulator 816 accounts for nearly half of the 17,852 missing ballot images from the second machine count.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Secretary of State’s office and Fulton County claim they were able to obtain 518,960 ballot images from the recount, still short of the 527,925 certified total, cited as "Exhibit 11” in their investigative report. However, this exhibit has been hidden from the public and from the State Election Board.</p>
<p>McGowan is <a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1816456290329080273?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>holding the evidence hostage</span></a>, and will only allow Board members to see the ballot images if they promise to stop investigating SEB-2023-025, the Moncla/Rossi complaint. Dr. Janice Johnston has sought access to the ballot images — the basis for which the state has attempted to close the case — but has yet to obtain them.</p>
<p>"[W]e can make the files available for inspection, as long as the Board is in agreement that this case is fully resolved and closed,” McGowan wrote in an email to Johnston on May 14.</p>
<p>In other words, you can only see the evidence for why they are closing the case if the case is closed. The Secretary of State office is treating their investigation just like its elections: accept their verdict without allowing anyone to see the actual results.</p>
<p>The investigation is not fully closed, and there is an opportunity for the Board to vote to conduct further research into the case at the upcoming Aug. 7 meeting.</p>
<p>Fulton County is still seeking to imprison President Trump and 18 others for questioning the 2020 results.</p>
