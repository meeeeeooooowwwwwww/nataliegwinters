<p>In a Tuesday WarRoom discussion, Gina Swoboda, Carolina Wren, and Steve Bannon strongly emphasized the perceived security issues and alleged biases within the Maricopa County election system. They discussed the arrest of Walter Ringfield Jr., a temporary election worker, for stealing a key fob and security lanyard, which were deemed crucial for accessing and potentially manipulating election equipment.</p>
<p>Bannon and Wren highlighted their skepticism about the narrative provided by the mainstream media, pointing out discrepancies in how Ringfield’s political affiliations and actions were reported. She mentioned that Ringfield, once a registered Democrat involved with a left-wing NGO, had his social media wiped clean except for a Truth Social account, raising suspicions about FBI involvement. Wren said, “The only person who can delete and wipe someone’s social media accounts while they’re in a jail cell is the FBI.”</p>
<p>As the Arizona GOP chair, Swoboda emphasized the lack of communication from Maricopa County officials about the incident and the potential security risks. She criticized the response time and transparency, stating, “They didn’t notify us and they didn’t notify the public… if there’s a security risk, you have to tell the party and the campaigns.”</p>
<p>Swoda called for immediate legal action and more aggressive measures to ensure election integrity, noting Arizona’s critical importance in national elections: “If we don’t win Arizona, we don’t win the presidency.”</p>
<p>Bannon pushed for urgency and action, criticizing the response’s perceived passivity so far. He advocated for more proactive measures, including pressuring the local prosecutor’s office and ensuring robust legal representation to address these concerns effectively.</p>

<h1>BOMBSHELL: Maricopa County Hides Voting Security Risks On Election Day</h1>
<h1>Democrat Advocate And Election Worker ARRESTED In Maricopa County, AZ</h1>
<p>During a press conference on Tuesday to address the arrest,  Maricopa County, AZ Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates and other election supervisors addressed the recent security breach involving the temporary election worker who stole the key fob.</p>
<p>They emphasized that the incident would not affect the upcoming primary election, with one official stating, “We reprogrammed all of the tabulators again, these are just calculators used on Election Day, and then we did the logic and accuracy test. It should not have any impact whatsoever on the primary.”</p>
<p>Law enforcement’s quick response was praised. “The suspect was arrested the day that we determined it was missing, and the black security key was recovered again on the same day,” Gates said.</p>
<p>This prompt action, they said, “should instill even more confidence in folks out in the community.”</p>
<p>Gates detailed the county’s security protocols, which include criminal background checks for all temporary employees. However, they acknowledged limitations, explaining, “We do a criminal background check and when we did that criminal background check, we did not find this; he was on diversion.”</p>
<p>They reassured the public of their commitment to election security, stating, “You can’t put a price on democracy and election security.”</p>
<p>Addressing concerns about potential misuse of the stolen key, they clarified, “This black security key is part of a multi-layered process to essentially turn on the tabulators on Election Day. With this alone, no nefarious actors would be able to turn on the tabulation machine.”</p>
<p>In response to fears of new conspiracy theories, a supervisor remarked, “I certainly hope that people don’t take this incident to spin up new conspiracy theories, but that’s exactly why the sheriff and I are here today to answer these questions.” The officials concluded by reaffirming their commitment to transparency and security, vowing to “act strongly” against any threats to the integrity of the elections.</p>
