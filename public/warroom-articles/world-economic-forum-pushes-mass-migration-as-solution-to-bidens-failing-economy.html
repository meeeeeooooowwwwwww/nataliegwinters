<p>Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum proposed mass immigration as the solution to America's ongoing economic crisis.</p>
</div>
<p>The suggestion was made in an <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/10/labour-immigration-worker-shortages/">article</a> – "Labour squeeze: Is immigration the answer to widespread worker shortages?" – on the World Economic Forum (WEF) website by the group's <span>Digital Editor for  Strategic Intelligence</span>, John Letzing.</p>
<div>
<p>The WEF, which has admitted to exploiting COVID-19 and climate change to advance a far-left social agenda which includes the abolition of private property, closely collaborates with the world's leading corporations – all of which benefit from the cheap labor provided by immigration.</p>
<p>"Several years after a financially strapped New York City was denied federal assistance in 1975, it commenced a period of economic revival mostly remembered in terms of zealous, <a href="https://www.gothamcenter.org/blog/broken-windows-policing-and-the-orderly-city-new-york-since-the-late-twentieth-century">broken-windows </a>policing and a deep cleanse of Times Square," begins the article before claiming:</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>"But the real key ingredient? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/30/nyregion/new-arrivals-immigrants-reshape-new-york-young-immigrant-wave-lifts-new-york.html">Immigrants</a>."</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>The article laments that "the calculated use of nationalism and prejudice can hinder meaningful immigration reform," before praising counties including Canada and Germany for relaxing its immigration restrictions.</p>
</div>
<p>"And now that one credit rating agency is predicting a “1990-style” recession in the US, it's worth recalling not just the role of immigration in the economic revival that was getting underway in New York City in that year â€" but also its role in bolstering the country's financial strength for centuries," concludes the piece.</p>
<div>While the WEF's solution may be favored by Democrats and big business, mass migration is a chief <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/may07/w12518.html">catalyst for the wage depression and high unemployment plaguing </a>working Americans as noted by the National Bureau of Economic Research.</div>
<div>President Barack Obama's own Federal Commission on Civil Rights report, <em><a href="https://www.onlabor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IllegImmig_10-14-10_430pm.pdf">"The Impact of Illegal Immigration on the Wages and Employment Opportunities of Black Workers,"</a></em> even concluded "illegal immigration to the United States in recent decades has tended to depress both wages and employment rates for low-skilled American citizens, a disproportionate number of whom are black men."</div>
