<p>Over the past couple of months, I have had several dinners with some of my friends at the highest levels of our intelligence community.</p>
<p>These were private conversations and extremely candid from both sides.  They were one-on-one dinners with my friends in various areas of the intel world, both domestic and international.</p>
<p>I told them I wanted to write about our conversations and they voiced no objection since they trust my discernment in how to handle sensitive matters like our conversations.</p>
<p>The one conclusion that came from these dinners is that Blacks have absolutely no intelligence!</p>
<p>No, we are not talking about mental acuity or brain power; we are talking about Blacks having no knowledge of how the intelligence community views us as a collective group and its implication on how they interact with us.</p>
<p>Presidents, corporate leaders, and politicians have been using this clandestine information to manipulate Black folks for decades.</p>
<p>These operatives were so taken aback by what I shared with them that they had to go back and verify what I said to them.</p>
<p>What shocked them most was the fact that I was even aware of the intelligence community's assessment of Blacks.</p>
<p>Their assessment has not changed in over two generations, since the 1960s.  According to them, "Blacks are very emotional people.  Get them emotional and they will forget their objective.  Make them feel good emotionally and they will forget what their anger was all aboutâ€¦Pick leaders for them that we [the intelligence community] can control, prop them up in the media and Blacks will follow blindly."</p>
<p>Look no further than our reaction to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s death in Memphis, TN in 1968, George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis, MN in 2020, or Michael Brown's killing in Ferguson, MO in 2014, to name a few.</p>
<p>Blacks burned down their own communities after each of these incidents, just like the intelligence assessment predicted.  We lost sight of our objective, justice for the slain victims, in a fit of emotion.  To this day, these neighborhoods have not recovered from the carnage that Blacks inflicted on their own communities.</p>
<p>In most, if not all, of these emotional outbursts within the Black community, somewhere in the midst you will find operatives from various intelligence agencies lighting the match to an already volatile situation.</p>
<p>America's history is replete with examples of this.</p>
<p>In today's technology driven society, it is even easier for the intelligence agencies to manipulate Black people, especially for foreign actors.</p>
<p>Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are the biggest foreign manipulators of Blacks.  North of 25% of the social media followers for groups like the NAACP, the National Urban League, and the Congressional Black Caucus are foreign bots that are sowing the seeds of chaos and descension within the Black community.</p>
<p>These foreign intelligence agencies have wholly devoted departments devoted to sowing seeds of discord and strife within the Black community.  Many prominent Black athletes and entertainers are engaging with foreign intelligence officials through their social media accounts and don't even know it.</p>
<p>If you know what to look for, you can spot foreign interference a mile away on your social media.  These countries know that race is still the Achilles Hill of America and they use this flaw to manipulate Americans in all the worst ways.</p>
<p>This me-too movement and radical feminist Black Girls Rock campaign has its origin with foreign psychological operations (psy-op) campaigns emanating from the foreign countries listed above.</p>
<p>When Democrats fear low voter turnout within the Black community they run to the Black church.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The intelligence community's "chosen" Black leaders are mostly preachers/activists who can and will get Black folks riled up emotionally; only for them to leave the church facing the same problems they had before they walked into the church.  They forgot their objective.</p>
<p>Black members of Congress have never seen nor even thought to ask to see this intelligence assessment of the Black community. But they know what pronoun to call you.</p>
<p>But they "feel good."</p>
<p>We elected a Black president in 2008, which was historic and very emotional; but you can't point to one tangible thing that was done "specifically" for Blacks in eight years of Obama being in the White House.</p>
<p>Again, we got so emotional that we forgot our objective!</p>
<p>Until we stop allowing outsiders to pick our leaders, we will continue to be manipulated by others both foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>Our leaders must be businessmen who have a thorough understanding of how to play on the power level. These folks tend not to be emotional, but rather are methodical and driven by results.</p>
<p>It behooves Blacks to become better informed on how the intelligence communities view us and how they constantly manipulate us to stay distracted from the objectives we have in moving our community forward.</p>
<p>To continue to operate in the dark only proves that Blacks have no intelligence.</p>
