<p>Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose talked to WarRoom host Ben Harnwell about each states’ critical role in maintaining election integrity and ensuring that only eligible voters participate in elections. LaRose emphasized the state’s responsibility in verifying voter eligibility and the steps Ohio takes to address this crucial issue before the November election.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>LaRose began by addressing the core responsibility of state officials in managing voter rolls. "Elections are clearly the state’s responsibility,” he stated. "The law gives us as Secretary of State that responsibility, and the federal government doesn’t help us carry out that responsibility. And that’s really one of the big problems.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>LaRose’s comments reflect a frustration with the lack of federal assistance in this area, exposing the substantial burden placed on state-level authorities.</p>
<p>LaRose also discussed the importance of communication with individuals whose citizenship status is in question.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"We send a round of mailings to them,” he explained. "I said, listen, I want to know if you’re a citizen. Tell me if you’re not a citizen, please understand that you are risking being charged with a felony, which makes you subject to immediate deportation.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This direct approach prompts individuals to correct their registration status if necessary, reducing the risk of unauthorized voting.</p>
<p>LaRose told Harnwell that Ohio has implemented a rigorous process to identify and remove non-citizens from the voter rolls to combat voter fraud and ensure compliance with legal requirements. LaRose explained, "We are removing non-citizens from the voter rolls and actually referring them for prosecution because the law, that’s not followed, is not a law, it’s a suggestion.”</p>
<p>This proactive approach demonstrates Ohio’s commitment to upholding electoral laws and maintaining the integrity of the voting system.</p>
<p>The process of removing non-citizens from voter rolls involves several steps. Initially, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles served as a critical filter. When individuals apply for a state driver’s license or ID, their citizenship status is assessed. "We use that with that,” LaRose said, referring to the department’s data, "and we were able to remove hundreds of non-citizens from the voter rolls.”</p>
<p>This initial step is crucial in identifying potential issues with voter eligibility.</p>
<p>However, LaRose noted that the process is far from straightforward. "The process is much harder than it needs to be because of lack of cooperation from the federal government,” he said.</p>
<p>The challenge is compounded by the need to manually handle data and the fees associated with accessing federal databases. Despite these hurdles, LaRose’s office remains committed to the task, working through the complexities to ensure compliance with legal standards.</p>
<p>Addressing criticisms of these efforts, LaRose countered that the goal is not voter suppression but adherence to legal requirements. "We’re simply trying to establish who’s a citizen and who’s not,” he asserted. "Ohio’s Constitution requires it, and federal law requires it.” His comments highlight the balance between enforcing legal standards and addressing public concerns about election integrity.</p>
<p>As the November election approaches, LaRose’s efforts are about the critical role of state officials in safeguarding the electoral process. By ensuring that voter rolls are accurate and removing non-citizens, Ohio aims to uphold the integrity of its elections and reinforce public confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges and criticisms, LaRose’s commitment to this process reflects states’ essential responsibility in managing and securing the electoral process.</p>
