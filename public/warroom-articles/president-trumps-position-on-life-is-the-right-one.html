<div>
<p><span><span>President Trump released a statement regarding his pro-life views in relation to the 2024 Election on Monday. It is the right one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The 45th President made clear this issue must be decided by the People, in each state, as it was before </span></span><span><span>Roe v. Wade</span></span><span><span> took abortion, and with it, a sense of responsibility, out of the People’s hands.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"This 50-year battle over </span></span><span><span>Roe v. Wade</span></span><span><span> took it out of the federal hands and brought it into the hearts, minds, and vote of the people in each state, it was really something,” President Trump said. "Now, it’s up to the states to do the right thing.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>President Trump is pro-life. In fact, he is the most pro-life president in history. The overturning of </span></span><span><span>Roe</span></span><span><span> would not have happened without him. He won the 2016 Election, courageously stood by his nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh amidst false accusations, and stayed true to his word to nominate constitutionalist jurists, appointing three to the Supreme Court, </span></span><a href="https://youtu.be/iTSVzSiRpcI?si=2p1cjK25482ZFC0p"><span><span>exactly as he said he would</span></span></a><span><span>. Every time he was faced with a policy position regarding abortion as president, he chose life. </span></span><a href="https://x.com/russvought/status/1777399709008629925?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span><span>Every single time</span></span></a><span><span>. Yet, he cannot choose for you and me. He cannot choose for the People of this Country.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The choice before America is a choice as old as time. Choose life or choose death. It is the </span></span><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/100/deu.30.15-20.NASB1995"><span><span>same choice</span></span></a>
<span><span>set before the Israelites in the wilderness: life and prosperity, or death and destruction.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It is obvious America is going the way of death and destruction. Our border is nonexistent, lawlessness abounds, the economy in peril, the American Dream in shambles, our elections worse than the third world. Is it any wonder why? If human beings are discarded in the trash, marked "</span></span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/05/lauren-handy-abortion-dc/"><span><span>medical waste</span></span></a><span><span>,” how much less does it take to discard votes (and </span></span><a href="https://x.com/reallizusa/status/1742512878526025893?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span><span>insert illegitimate ones</span></span></a><span><span>) to rig an election?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A country cannot sacrifice over 65 million innocent children and think God will not notice. He knows them all by name.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>President Trump is also right to </span></span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112245317599582377"><span><span>point out</span></span></a><span><span> the hypocrisy of those on the right willing to negotiate with the left, ever upward, in their quest to keep this issue going and pass a national abortion ban. It went from 0 weeks to 6 weeks to 15. Why is it okay to dismember and suck the life out of an unborn child at week 5, when the baby’s heart, stomach, liver, and kidneys are already starting to form, but not at week 6? At 14 weeks, when they can wiggle their toes, but not at 15, when they start hiccuping? Negotiating with evil never ends well. A national political policy is not always the answer to a national heart issue. A nation content to sacrifice its own children for convenience and wealth will secure neither.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The choice is before every American. President Trump is right "that we have an obligation to the salvation of our Nation,” to win. Our nation can be saved by America choosing life, to return to God, love Him, and walk in His ways.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"This is all about the will of the people,” President Trump said. "You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith. Do what’s right for your family and do what’s right for yourself. Do what’s right for your children, do what’s right for our country, and vote.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Looking at recent elections with this issue on the ballot makes one fear "letting the People decide.” But are the People deciding? Their choice was stolen from them in 2020. Why is anyone convinced, with no real substantive reform of the voting system, that our elections have been legitimate since? (When a country falls to socialism, ever notice how subsequent elections keep going the socialists’ way?)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>That leaves us with a stark reality. Either our elections are corrupt and many other races have been stolen, or, our elections are legitimate and the People would rather have, for example, a </span></span><a href="https://x.com/greg_price11/status/1585060068932063233?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span><span>near brain dead communist</span></span></a><span><span> represent them, just as long as they can keep killing babies. Mainstream Republicans blame these losses on "candidate quality,” when Democrats can run an actual corpse and </span></span><a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/state/2022/11/10/pa-elects-longtime-state-representative-who-died-last-month-anthony-tony-deluca/69635840007/"><span><span>still win</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span><span><span> That is </span></span><a href="https://x.com/rncresearch/status/1768732827363713258?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span><span>the plan</span></span></a><span><span> again this November.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then again, one can count on one hand the number of Republicans who actually give the voters a real choice against the Democrats. President Trump is one of them. Americans have a real choice, for life, peace, and prosperity, on Nov. 5, 2024, which President Trump has declared "Christian Visibility Day.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The People will get what they choose. If Americans continue to be apathetic about the ways of God, do not expect anything to change politically, and expect things to get much worse. But if — not just on Nov. 5, but every day — we choose life, God will bless America again. </span></span></p>
