<p>In a recent discussion on The War Room, Dave Brat hosted China expert Gordon Chang to explore the complex and often dangerous geopolitical dynamics involving China, the United States, and other global actors. The conversation centered around China’s strategic ambitions and current geopolitical maneuvers, painting a picture of a nation with grand territorial aspirations and a precarious economic backdrop that fuels its aggressive posture.</p>
<p>Chang argued that the world is facing its most dangerous time in history, even more so than the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We knew then that Khrushchev and Kennedy were unwilling to use their nukes; we don’t know that about Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, and Vladimir Putin,” Chang warned. He criticized the current U.S. administration, stating, “We have a president who has checked out and is not defending our country.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Chang opened the conversation by addressing a debate regarding China’s desire for war. Colonel Derrick Harvey had<a href="https://warroom.org/essential-insights-for-voters-col-derek-harveys-key-warnings-on-iran-china-and-u-s-domestic-challenges/"> previously </a><span><a href="https://warroom.org/essential-insights-for-voters-col-derek-harveys-key-warnings-on-iran-china-and-u-s-domestic-challenges/">argued in the show</a></span> that China does not want a war, particularly a kinetic one, because it would threaten its own existence.</p>
<p>However, Chang emphasized that while China may not seek direct military conflict, its actions signal a broader ambition for global dominance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“China doesn’t want a kinetic war. What it wants is to annex territories of other nations,” Chang asserted. He further elaborated that China’s ultimate goal is to “destroy the United States” and “rule the moon and Mars as sovereign Chinese territory” without resorting to war.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Chang explained that China is actively engaging in activities akin to warfare through proxy conflicts and territorial intimidation. “China is fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine, fueling Iran’s attacks on Israel, and along with Russia, it’s fueling insurgencies in North Africa,” Chang noted. He highlighted China’s belligerent activities toward the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and India as potential preludes to direct conflict.</p>
<p>According to Chang, the political system in China has inherent incentives to pursue aggressive expansion, either through intimidation or territorial annexation.</p>
<p>Dave Brat pointed out that China’s extensive geopolitical ventures rely heavily on a robust economy, which appears to be weakening. “The Chinese economy is not growing at the 4.7% pace they claim for the second quarter of this year; it’s barely above zero, if that,” Brat observed.</p>
<p>Chang agreed, adding that the economic downturn inhibits China’s ability to finance its military and international projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. This economic strain makes China even more dangerous, as President Xi Jinping faces mounting pressure for a quick victory to consolidate his power.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping, Chang explained, is in a precarious position domestically. He has centralized power, making him accountable for the country’s economic woes. “Xi Jinping realizes that he’s being blamed for the economy, the demographic problems, and everything else,” Chang stated.</p>
<p>This personal accountability means Xi is at risk politically, driving him to seek quick victories to silence dissent within the Communist Party. Chang warned that Xi’s domestic incentives are “to be belligerent and provocative, which means he can take us by surprise.”</p>
<p>When asked about where Xi might seek a quick victory, Chang identified the Philippines as a likely target due to its perceived vulnerability. “A war on Taiwan would be very difficult and unpopular with the Chinese people,” Chang explained. “But with the Philippines, he thinks they’re an easy target.” He noted recent acts of aggression, including the seizure of Philippine vessels and the injuring of Filipino sailors, as potential precursors to more significant conflict.</p>
<p>Chang’s insights expose a world where China’s economic struggles and internal political pressures could lead to unexpected and potentially catastrophic global conflicts. As Chang’s analysis reveals, understanding China’s motivations and potential actions is crucial for navigating the current geopolitical landscape.</p>
<p>Chang’s new book, Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America, will be published by Newsmax on October 1st. It promises to explore these themes further, offering readers a detailed examination of China’s strategies and their implications for global security.</p>
