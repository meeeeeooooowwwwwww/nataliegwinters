<p>The lobbyist for Jeff Bezos, Big Pharma, and a company the U.S. has national security concerns about could become D.C.'s "<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/08/jeff-miller-mccarthy-ally-k-street-00065588">most powerful unelected man</a>" if Kevin McCarthy becomes House Speaker.</p>
<p>D.C. lobbyist Jeff Miller is an outside adviser to Kevin McCarthy who has his “ear.” His influence over Kevin McCarthy will shape the Republican agenda if Kevin becomes Speaker.</p>
<p>Miller’s extremely close relationship with McCarthy is without question.</p>
<p>Here is how Politico describes Miller’s relationship — “close confidant, travel companion, helpful fundraiser, and political consigliere.” <em>The New York Times</em>, meanwhile, reported they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/us/politics/liz-cheney-kevin-mccarthy.html">the “closest of friends” and reported that “in Washington's Republican circles, the relationship between lobbyist and leader is well known and Mr. Miller's word is authoritative.”</a></p>
<p>Miller’s corporate clients are then of utmost importance.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen Miller’s impact on McCarthy, as Miller was registered as a lobbyist for <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q3/301417772.xml">Apple</a> and <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q3/301417877.xml">Amazon</a> on antitrust. McCarthy has consistently opposed legislation that would break up the Silicon Valley behemoths.</p>
<p>Miller also registered indirectly for Big Tech through a group called the <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q3/301416966.xml">“Connected Commerce Council.”</a> That’s a group funded by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/30/connected-commerce-council-amazon-google-lobbying-00021801">Amazon and Google that falsely claimed to represent dozens of small businesses.  </a></p>
<p>Miller’s corporate clients are varied. He’s lobbied for the <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q1/301366595.xml">Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America</a>. That’s the Big Pharma association that includes Pfizer as a member.</p>
<p>Think a Speaker McCarthy will go after Pfizer for COVID-19 vaccine issues?</p>
<p>What about the fact that the likely incoming House Speaker’s top outside adviser has lobbied for a company the U.S. has national security concerns about?</p>
<p>Miller’s been a <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q1/301366097.xml">registered lobbyist</a> for Broadcom. When Broadcom tried to purchase American-owned Qualcomm, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/trump-signs-order-prohibiting-broadcom-takeover-of-qualcomm">blocked</a> it on national security grounds. As <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/trump-signs-order-prohibiting-broadcom-takeover-of-qualcomm">Reuters</a> cautioned: “A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom’s relationship with third party foreign entities.”</p>
<p>Rep. McCarthy’s good friend has other clients with China ties such as <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q1/301366079.xml">Blackstone</a>. The investment giant did $32 <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2b72ef10-ed8a-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0">billion worth of Chinese deals between 2013 and 2018, alone</a>. Blackstone was also partly owned by China for over a decade. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5fcf204a-26ba-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0">China sold its stake in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Miller also represents a firm called the <a href="https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2022/Q1/301366793.xml">U.S. Immigration Fund</a>. This group helps foreigners get EB-5 visas. Miller registered to lobby on “issues related to the reauthorization of the U.S. EB-5 Investor Program; including S. 831 – EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2021.”</p>
<p>The EB-5 visa program allows foreigners and their immediate families to get green cards if they invest at least $800,000.</p>
<p>A 2022 study in the British Journal of Sociology <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-4446.12940">stated “most of the visas were acquired by Chinese millionaires, who recorded the world’s highest application rate.” </a></p>
