<p>Colonel Derek Harvey, a distinguished military strategist and former National Security Council staffer during President Donald Trump’s administration, recently shared his perspectives on the escalating challenges facing the United States in the context of unrestricted warfare. In a conversation with Steve Bannon on the WarRoom, Harvey highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach to address the growing threats to the country, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Unrestricted Warfare:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Unrestricted Warfare” is a concept introduced in a book titled “Unrestricted Warfare: China’s Master Plan to Destroy America.” It was written by two Chinese colonels, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, and published in 1999. The book discusses unconventional methods that countries, particularly China, could use to challenge and defeat more technologically advanced adversaries like the United States. It proposes strategies such as economic warfare, cyber attacks, terrorism, and psychological operations as means to achieve military objectives without engaging in traditional armed conflict. The term “unrestricted warfare” implies a departure from conventional rules of engagement and the use of diverse tactics across various domains to achieve strategic goals.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unrestricted-Warfare-Chinas-Destroy-America/dp/1626543054">From the book’s description:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“A sobering and fascinating study on war in the modern era, <span>Unrestricted Warfare</span> carefully explores strategies that militarily and politically disadvantaged nations might take to successfully attack a geopolitical super-power like the United States. American military doctrine is typically led by technology; a new class of weapon or vehicle is developed, which allows or encourages an adjustment in strategy. Military strategists Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui argue that this dynamic is a crucial weakness in the American military, and that this blind spot with regard to alternative forms warfare could be effectively exploited by enemies. <span>Unrestricted Warfare</span> concerns the many ways in which this might occur, and, in turn, suggests what the United States might do to defend itself.</p></blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>The traditional mentality that offensive action is limited to military action is no longer adequate given the range of contemporary threats and the rising costs-both in dollars and lives lost-of traditional warfare. Instead, Liang and Xiangsui suggest the significance of alternatives to direct military confrontation, including international policy, economic warfare, attacks on digital infrastructure and networks, and terrorism. Even a relatively insignificant state can incapacitate a far more powerful enemy by applying pressure to their economic and political systems. Exploring each of these considerations with remarkable insight and clarity, <span>Unrestricted Warfare</span> is an engaging evaluation of our geopolitical future.”</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Harvey emphasized the urgent need to understand and counter unrestricted warfare, a term used to describe the comprehensive and integrated approach to conflict that goes beyond traditional military means. This type of warfare encompasses economic, psychological, and informational dimensions, making it difficult for conventional military capabilities to maintain global peace and security.</p>
<p><strong>The Domestic Front: A New Battleground</strong></p>
<p>In the discussion, Harvey pointed out the increasing influence of foreign actors and ideologies on American society, particularly on college campuses. He highlighted the role of China, through platforms like TikTok, in shaping public opinion and exacerbating domestic tensions. Harvey also expressed concerns about the influx of foreign students and the funding of academic programs by foreign governments, which he believes are intended to influence outcomes and shape American culture.</p>
<p><strong>The Need for Action: A Comprehensive Strategy</strong></p>
<p>To counter unrestricted warfare, Harvey called for a focused effort by the U.S. government to address the threats posed by foreign influence and domestic unrest. He suggested public hearings, investigations, and defunding programs that do not align with American interests. He also stressed the importance of a common set of talking points and a unified approach by Republican leaders to address these issues effectively.</p>
