<p>President Trump has pledged to investigate Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, if he is elected in 2024. In a post on Truth Social, Trump criticized the media conglomerate for what he perceives as “knowingly dishonest and corrupt coverage” by NBC News and MSNBC. Referring to MSNBC as “MSDNC (Democrat National Committee!)”, Trump accused the network of engaging in “Country Threatening Treason.”</p>
<p>Trump reiterated his commitment to scrutinize the media if he wins the presidency, labeling them as the “enemy of the people” and asserting that they should pay a “big price” for their actions.</p>
<p>Even on seemingly straightforward matters like how often Democrat Joe Biden has given graduation speeches, MSNBC has found itself entangled in accusations of spreading misinformation and spreading pro-Democrat propaganda.</p>
<p>Recently, conservative figure Richard Grenell, who served in the Trump administration as an openly homosexual man, lambasted MSNBC and its parent company Comcast following a press dinner. Grenell criticized the lack of dissenting views within the company, highlighting the perceived intolerance towards Trump Republicans and the absence of diverse perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Junk News:</strong></p>
<p>Nowhere is the anger at Comcast, MSNBC, and, more specifically, MSNBC programming, more palatable than on Steve Bannon’s WarRoom. A recurring theme on Bannon’s top-rated political program has been starting the show with cold-open clips from Morning Joe, featuring hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.</p>
<p>However, these segments have not been well-received by the WarRoom audience, who perceive the MSNBC agenda as anti-American and harmful.</p>
<p>One outspoken WarRoom viewer recently voiced intense disapproval of Morning Joe, suggesting that discussing Scarborough should involve consistent reference to his employers by their proper name – MICROSOFT NATIONAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM (MSNBC). This, the viewer argued, Morning Joe  and MSNBC “serves as a constant reminder of the entity ultimately responsible for questionable journalism.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“When the WarRoom is talking about Scarborough, I think it would be better to always refer to his bosses by their real name – might as well pin the tail on the real donkey MICROSOFT NATIONAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM – might as well remind people every day who is ordering all this crap journalism and remind them that the reason they contribute to Comcast’s (their “owner”) bottom line is because their advertisers are so happy with the crap they sell to you folks, the advertisers fork over tons of money to hawk their wares to us suckers. Its genius that we are paying for our own demise but it is also disgusting, suicidal, brutally cynical.”</p></blockquote>
<p>MSNBC is owned by Comcast and falls under the umbrella of NBCUniversal.</p>
<p>Comcast has a host of it’s own terrible PR.  They provide financial support to MSNBC through various means, including advertising revenue, subscription fees, and partnerships. While Comcast’s funding helps sustain MSNBC’s operations, the network claims to maintain editorial independence, meaning Comcast does not dictate specific content or editorial direction.</p>
<p>But that is not really how business works, especially not for an organization that thrives on government contracts and associations, and there has been a lack of transparency about funding.</p>
<p>Comcast, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has faced many controversies. Such controversies have contributed to negative perceptions of Comcast among consumers and advocacy groups, highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability in corporate behavior.</p>
<p>And that is where there are big problems.</p>
<p>The WarRoom fan’s angry post underscored the need to highlight MSNBC’s role in shaping what many Americans see as a dangerous anti-American narrative and also how viewers inadvertently contribute to later profits that go to- Comcast- <strong>through advertising.</strong></p>
<p>That may be, in large part, what the company hopes to hide- who is funding this propaganda?</p>
<p>Comcast’s bad reputation stems from controversies over net neutrality, lobbying, and customer privacy concerns. Critics argue its practices stifle competition, unfairly influence government and internet policy, and compromise user data privacy, leading to negative perceptions.</p>
<p>The post’s author made a great point when he described this situation as a paradox: audiences unknowingly fund content that they perceive as detrimental to their interests.</p>
<p>President Donald J. Trump has also targeted Morning Joe, frequently blaming the show for its low ratings and perceived dissemination of disinformation on his social media platforms.</p>
<p><b>Junk Fees:</b></p>
<p>Comcast (CMCSA) has been embroiled in customer service and pricing controversies, drawing ire from consumers and even attracting the attention of Democrats. So there is some unity on this issue.</p>
<p>The company’s practice of adding undisclosed fees to advertised prices has sparked outrage, prompting Biden to criticize “junk fees” that burden households. Amidst low customer satisfaction ratings, Comcast faced scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for inaccurate coverage data submitted for its broadband map. The company initially disputed complaints, only admitting fault after media attention. The FCC’s response was criticized for its bureaucratic handling, leaving consumers in limbo.</p>
<p>While mistakes can occur, Comcast’s reluctance to rectify errors and its combative approach raises concerns about accountability.</p>
<p>This incident underscores broader issues of transparency and accuracy in telecommunications providers’ reporting practices, prompting calls for closer scrutiny of industry data.</p>
<p><strong>Junk Fees pay for Junk News:</strong></p>
<p>And Trump has promised to investigate the situation.  The WarRoom Posse will be so happy.</p>
<p>"I say up front, openly, and proudly, that when I WIN the Presidency of the United States, they and others of the LameStream Media will be thoroughly scrutinized for their knowingly dishonest and corrupt coverage of people, things, and events,” the former President wrote on Truth social.</p>
<p>Trump also <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437610-trump-calls-press-the-enemy-of-the-people/">used a phrase</a> he has often used for news media in the past, calling it the "enemy of the people.”</p>
<p>"The Fake News Media should pay a big price for what they have done to our once great Country!” Trump added.</p>
