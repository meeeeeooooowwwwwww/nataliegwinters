<h4>BHR Partners – a private equity firm co-founded by Hunter Biden alongside Chinese Communist Party-run financial institutions – invested in Insilico Medicine, a biotechnology company working on COVID-19 treatments that recently partnered with Pfizer.</h4>
<p>BHR Partners, a highly controversial joint venture between an investment fund founded by Biden and Obama-era Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson and the state-owned Bank of China, has been <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bhr-partners/signals_and_news">part</a> of two multi-million-dollar funding rounds for Insilico Medicine: a $35,000,000 raise in August and a $60,000,000 raise in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insilico-medicine-raises-60-million-in-series-d-financing-to-advance-pipeline-and-launch-ai-powered-drug-discovery-robotics-laboratory-301561736.html">June</a>.</p>
<p>The president’s son pledged to divest of his 10 percent stake in BHR Partners in 2019, which was notoriously birthed <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/10/6-facts-about-hunter-bidens-business-dealings-in-china/">less than two weeks after</a> Biden traveled to China alongside his father and then-Vice President, but reportedly still owns <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/records-show-hunter-biden-still-controls-10-stake-in-chinese-firm-despite-leaving-its-board">10 percent</a> of the fund.</p>
<p>When a White House spokesman was <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/26/wh-spox-cant-say-if-hunter-biden-still-co-owns-firm-with-beijing/amp/">asked</a> about the status of Biden's financial relationship with BHR Partners on October 26th, he refused to say that the president's son had divested his shares in the company.</p>
<p>War Room can now reveal that BHR Partners is funding the biotechnology firm Insilico Medicine, which is actively engaged in – and ostensibly profiting from – a <a href="https://insilico.com/ncov-sprint">search</a> for COVID-19 drugs and <a href="https://insilico.com/insiliconanome">treatments</a>.</p>
<p>"Our <a href="https://insilico.com/about">mission</a> is to accelerate drug discovery and drug development by continuously inventing
and deploying new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. We provide AI solutions to the top pharma and biotechnology companies to enable streamlined R&amp;D efforts and transform the way therapeutics and materials are discovered," explains the mission statement of the company, which is based in Hong Kong and New York.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insilico-medicine-announces-novel-3cl-protease-inhibitor-preclinical-candidate-for-covid-19-treatment-301553766.html">boasted</a> about using its proprietary platform  to “<span>combat the pandemic early in the outbreak.”</span></p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic brought global attention to the pressing need for rapid drug development. We made an executive decision to start our COVID-19 program early,” said <span>Alex Zhavoronkov</span>, the company’s Founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in May, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insilico-medicine-announces-novel-3cl-protease-inhibitor-preclinical-candidate-for-covid-19-treatment-301553766.html">announced</a> it had discovered a preclinical candidate for COVID-19 treatment. “The candidate is intended to be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, along with other coronaviruses,” explained a press release.</p>
<p>InSilico Medicine has also partnered with other pharmaceutical firms to assist with their drug development endeavors.</p>
<p>In January 2020, shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Insilico Medicine <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insilico-enters-into-research-collaboration-with-pfizer-inc-to-explore-novel-data-and-artificial-intelligence-system-for-potential-therapeutic-targets-300986562.html">announced</a> an official partnership with Pfizer Inc., allowing the COVID-19 vaccine maker to "utilize Insilico’s machine learning technology and proprietary Pandomics Discovery Platform with the aim of identifying real-world evidence for potential therapeutic targets implicated in a variety of diseases."</p>
<p>“Insilico is advancing its latest target identification systems utilizing machine learning, generative biology methods, and synthetic data generation pipelines, and we are pleased to be collaborating with Pfizer on its target identification efforts,” said <span>Alex Zhavoronkov</span>, Ph.D., founder, and CEO of Insilico Medicine.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with Insilico as Pfizer continues to explore new technologies that may be able to help us identify targets and biomarkers that could assist in our discovery programs, and potentially lead to breakthrough therapeutics for patients with unmet medical needs,” said <span>Morten Sogaard</span>, Vice President, Target Sciences, Pfizer.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not Insilico Medicine assisted Pfizer with its COVID-19 vaccine development.</p>
