<p>AmWell, a telehealth start-up that Hunter Biden's hard drive reveals he invested in, has received several six-figure grants from federal agencies under the Biden administration, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Amidst 2014 negotiations between the son of President Joe Biden and AmWell about the size of his initial investment, Hunter Biden appeared to leverage "USG impact" as an "area of focus” where he could “have influence and operating impact to increase revenue and improve profitability” in emails exclusively revealed by War Room.</p>
<p>"USG" is a common <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/usg">abbreviation</a> for "United States Government."</p>
<p>The unearthed financial relationship between Hunter Biden and AmWell, which has received over $1 million in taxpayer funds since the onset of the Biden administration, follows a litany of other corrupt business deals pursued by Hunter Biden with foreign countries including China.</p>
<h4>COINCIDENCE?</h4>
<p>AmWell, formerly known as American Well, is a Boston-based telemedicine company connecting doctors and patients via video chat with coverage <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/amwell-lands-close-to-200m-funding-to-keep-up-demand-for-telehealth">reaching</a> over 150 million people.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, AmWell experienced significant growth amidst COVID-19 due to the fact that the company was well-suited for the pandemic-era shift to virtual healthcare. Accordingly, the company went <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/telehealth-company-amwell-spikes-public-debut-outsized-742m-ipo">public</a> in September 2020.</p>
<p>AmWell had previously received one grant during the Obama-Biden administration in <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_VA11811P0092_3600_-NONE-_-NONE-">2011</a> from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for "telehealth care,” but during the Biden administration, it has seen its receipt of federal grants skyrocket.</p>
<p>Since the inauguration of President Biden, AmWell has received a never-before-seen number of grants and contracts from federal agencies including the VA, Department of Defense (DOD), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Department of Health And Human Services (HHS).</p>
<p>A grant from the DOD for services described by a U.S. government database as providing a “virtual health enterprise <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_HT001521P0006_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-">platform</a>” has resulted in <span>$314,250 in taxpayer funds going to AmWell during the Biden administration.</span></p>
<p>Biden's Department of Veterans Affairs also awarded a subsidiary of AmWell a $120,000 grant for its services, described as the “<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_36C10X21P0051_3600_-NONE-_-NONE-">implementation</a> of leading digital mental and behavioral health platform for veterans enrolled in VHA mental health care to increase access to mental health care during Covid-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>The grant began on April 14, 2021, less than three months into the Biden administration, and concluded on September 30, 2022.</p>
<p>An additional $30,000 <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_36C24521P0534_3600_-NONE-_-NONE-">grant</a> from the VA to the AmWell subsidiary Silvercloud for “customizable mobile mental health <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_36C24521P0534_3600_-NONE-_-NONE-">treatment</a>” ran from September 27th, 2021 to September 26th, 2022.</p>
<p>AmWell has also received two six-figure payments from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) â€" worth $<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_RHCCCPP-21231641_2700">318,750</a> and $<a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_RHCCCPP-22247011_2700">233,750</a> â€" on June 30th, 2022 as part of a “Connected Care” pilot program.</p>
<p>“The Rural Health Care (RHC) program supports health care facilities in bringing world class medical care to rural areas through increased connectivity,” explains a summary of the initiative.</p>
<p>AmWell has not previously received any grants from the FCC.</p>
<p>Grants from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have also supported other companies purchasing AmWell products, as the agency <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75H70522P00002_7527_-NONE-_-NONE-">allocated $57,914 to </a>technology firm CDW to purchase an AmWell “telemedicine cart” in October 2021.</p>
<p>AmWell’s website also contains a <a href="https://business.amwell.com/government/">page</a> promoting its service “Virtual Healthcare for Government Agencies,” claiming that “t<span>elehealth is a powerful tool that can help government agencies increase readiness, improve health outcomes, and lower costs.” Among the resources listed on the page is a webinar titled "</span><a href="https://business.amwell.com/resources/prepping-for-federal-grant-success-in-2022/">Prepping for Federal Grant Success in 2022."</a></p>

<p>“This contract is for remote (virtual) medical and behavioral telehealth products and services.  The contract will serve as a purchasing vehicle for a wide array of government entities to augment healthcare services they provide to the citizens they serve.  The contract is convenience and is available to all government entities inside and outside of the State of Georgia,” explains a summary.</p>
<h4>FOLLOW THE MONEY.</h4>
<p>The apparent financial relationship between AmWell and the Biden administration comes amidst emails on Hunter Biden’s hard drive showing the president's son promising to leverage his connections to the government to help the company "increase revenue and improve profitability."</p>
<p>The stunning promise was made in an April 10th, 2014 email to the then-Vice President's son from Neil Callahan, a co-founder of Hunter Biden's investment firm Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP).</p>
<p>Titled "AmWell Email Talking Points," the email from Callahan provides Hunter Biden with details about for an upcoming meeting about potentially investing in the company. Callahan appears to be sending Hunter Biden a draft of an email for him to circulate to others on the call to have a cohesive message.</p>
<p>"Here are some talking points that may be helpful for the broader group," Callahan begins.</p>
<p>"As a part of our investment in American Well, we will ask the CEO to agree to the following:" reads the draft email from Hunter Biden which outlines various demands concerning "price," "governance," "strategic focus," "capital efficient culture," "RSTP impact," and a "gentleman’s agreement."</p>
<p>Beyond asking for a board seat for Hunter Biden, the email pointed to "USG impact" as a way that the then-Vice President's son’s company could help AmWell "increase revenue and improve profitability":</p>
<blockquote><p>"RSTP Impact: identify the 2-3 areas of focus to have influence and operating impact to increase revenue and improve profitability – payer sales, USG impact, brand/direct to consumer marketing program, etc."</p></blockquote>
<p>USG is <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/usg">shorthand</a> for the United States government.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Subsequent emails prove Hunter Biden ultimately invested in the company.</p>
<p>A March 15th, 2017 email from Hunter Biden’s business associate Eric <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/16/hunter-bidens-biz-partner-eric-schwerin-handled-finances-says-ex/">Schwerin</a> outlining the different ventures the president’s son held financial stakes in included American Well, noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“American Well (not sure of ownership percentage): Shares held in start-up technology company delivering telemedicine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Additional emails on the president’s son’s hard drive provide further insight into Hunter Biden’s involvement with the company, as he repeatedly conversed via email and telephone with the company’s CEO Ido Schoenberg.</p>
<p>“Hunter,” Schoenberg wrote, “we are delighted to have you as a partner in American Well. Thank you so much for your trust and confidence. If your time permits, I would ask you to consider joining our advisory board.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a separate email, Hunter Biden writes “OK. READY TO FUND. SEND INSTRUCTIONS. OR WHO I SHOULD TALK TO IN EMAIL INTRO,” in response to a business associate asking him to “close the loop with American Well and Ido this wk.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The latest revelation from Hunter Biden's hard drive follows other exclusive War Room reports tying the president's son to business deals involving <a href="https://warroom.org/2022/11/01/exc-hunter-bidens-chinese-private-equity-firm-invested-in-pfizer-partner-developing-covid-19-drugs/">Pfizer</a>, illegal <a href="https://warroom.org/2022/11/23/hunter-biden-owned-financial-stake-in-digital-banking-platform-for-undocumented-migrants/">immigration</a>, and <a href="https://warroom.org/2022/11/07/hunter-biden-linked-consulting-firm-helped-chinese-communist-party-run-company/">fertilizer</a> exported from America to China.</p>
