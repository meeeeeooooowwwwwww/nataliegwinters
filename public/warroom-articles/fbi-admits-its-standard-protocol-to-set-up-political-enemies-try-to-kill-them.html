<p>In a rare moment of candor, the FBI admitted it is "standard protocol” to entrap their opponents and try to kill them in unannounced raids.</p>
<p>"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants,” the brown shirts said, regarding news that they were prepared to use deadly force in their illegal raid on Mar-a-Lago.</p>
<p>You’d be forgiven for not knowing they always have a <a href="https://x.com/julie_kelly2/status/1792971790953668879?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>combat medic at the scene</span></a> when they send the Gestapo out to seize papers, except, of course, if they’re kept in an unlocked garage behind a corvette. Then they don’t send anybody at all.</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s standard operating procedure to <a href="https://www.declassified.live/p/the-dojs-doctored-crime-scene-photo"><span>fake evidence</span></a> and photograph it for pure propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>Relax. <a href="https://x.com/rogerjstonejr/status/1793110125865283946?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>Pre-dawn raids</span></a> on nonviolent, innocent political foes (and their lawyers) are totally normal in the Trump era. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/nyregion/rudy-giuliani-trump-ukraine-warrant.html"><span>It </span></a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/13/raid-veritas-okeefe-biden-press-521307"><span>happens</span></a>
<a href="https://x.com/jeffclarkus/status/1792981500457038212?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>all</span></a>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-conducted-predawn-raid-of-former-trump-campaign-chairman-manaforts-home/2017/08/09/5879fa9c-7c45-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html"><span>the</span></a>
<a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253523/acquitted-pro-life-activist-mark-houck-reveals-details-of-fbi-raid-will-press-charges"><span>time</span></a>. You can even watch live on CNN. Trade advisors are put in leg irons at the airport, and <a href="https://warroom.org/a-prayer-for-peter-navarro/"><span>thrown in prison</span></a>. Members of Congress have their phones <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/09/fbi-seize-gop-scott-perrys-phone-00050737"><span>seized</span></a>. The My Pillow CEO is <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/13/mypillow-ceo-mike-lindells-phone-seized-at-hardees-drive-thru/"><span>boxed in</span></a> at a Hardee’s drive-thru for questioning an election.</p>
<p>And don’t worry. Deadly force is to be used "only when necessary.” In case you’re wondering, the DOJ deems it "necessary” to surveill a 300-pound 75-year-old man, who uses a cane, for months and send <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2023/8/9/23826780/witnesses-fbi-kill-utah-man-threats-biden-social-media/"><span>dozens of armored agents</span></a> to break down his door, drive through his window, shoot him, and drag him out to bleed out on the sidewalk for mouthing off on social media and criticizing the Biden regime.</p>
<p>It was also "necessary” for the feds to <a href="https://x.com/cernovich/status/1743078790727926232?s=46&amp;t=Xy9bk4jXl0_wZCY6W88G-w"><span>accost</span></a> a Black Trump supporter while he was carrying his 2-year-old daughter home from a swimming lesson. Naturally, the agents were from the Washington Field Office.</p>
<p>"There was no departure from the norm in this matter,” the feds said, of <span>a raid into the home of a president of the United States</span>. Yep, this is the norm in the U.S.(S.)A.</p>
<p>It was all "<a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-graham-uncover-unusual-email-sent-susan-rice-herself-president-trump-s"><span>by the book</span></a>,” just like it always is when they try to frame President Donald J. Trump. It’s what they do. Falsely accuse your political opponent of a non-crime, leak the lies to the media, ruin their political career, and by the time the dust settles and they’re <a href="https://www.jonesday.com/en/practices/experience/2016/09/former-virginia-governor-robert-mcdonnells-corruption-convictions-unanimously-vacated-by-supreme-court-and-doj-later-drops-case"><span>overturned unanimously</span></a> at the Supreme Court, everyone has moved on to the next target. But it never works with President Trump. He doesn’t quit. He loves the People, and they love him. No one believes them anymore, so they have to resort to other measures.</p>
<p>Naturally they would try to dress up their third world assassination attempt in legalese and suits — or in this case, <a href="https://www.declassified.live/p/fbi-authorized-use-of-deadly-force?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web"><span>plain clothes</span></a>.</p>
<p>But dressing it up doesn’t change the fact that America is now a third world nation. They may bring their thuggery into courtrooms, with compromised, corrupt judges at the helm, but it’s the same old story. They steal elections, and then crack down on anyone who would dissent. They come only to steal and kill and destroy.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: Legitimate regimes claiming to have received the most votes in history don’t need to send armed feds to raid the home of their political opponents, especially the home of a former president who beat them twice and is getting ready to beat them for a third time. They don’t need to bring in troops and lock down the Capitol for their inauguration, either.</p>
<p>They’re illegitimate. They know it, and we know it. When will Republicans finally do something about it?</p>
