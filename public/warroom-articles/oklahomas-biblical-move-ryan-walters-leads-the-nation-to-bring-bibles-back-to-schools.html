<p>Ryan Walters, <a href="https://sde.ok.gov/superintendent-public-instruction-ryan-walters#:~:text=The%20Oklahoma%20State%20Department%20of%20Education">Oklahoma’s state superintendent of education</a>, appeared on Tuesday WarRoom, and talked about spearheading a groundbreaking initiative to distribute Bibles to every classroom in the state. His efforts not only aim to revitalize the teaching of American history but also seek to inspire similar initiatives nationwide, echoing support from influential figures like President Trump. Walters emphasizes the need for educational reform to combat leftist ideologies infiltrating schools, aiming to restore traditional values and a true understanding of America’s past.</p>
<h3>A Vision for Educational Reform</h3>
<p>Ryan Walters is determined to reshape Oklahoma’s educational landscape by ensuring every classroom has a copy of the Bible. In a recent discussion, he stated, "We allocated $3 million here in the state to make sure every single classroom has a copy of the Bible.” This initiative is not just about distributing books; it’s a strategic move to reinforce the historical significance of the Bible in American culture. Walters insists that students need to "understand the role the Bible played in American history” to grasp what makes the nation great.</p>
<h3>Overcoming Opposition</h3>
<p>Walters has faced considerable opposition from various quarters, including teachers’ unions and radical leftist groups. He remarked, "The teachers unions have fought us; the radical Marxist Democrats have funds, but it’s going to happen.” Despite these challenges, he remains steadfast in his mission, driven by the support he receives from parents and community members who want to counter what he describes as "left-wing indoctrination in the classroom.”</p>
<p>According to Walters, this fight is not just localized to Oklahoma but is a broader battle against a leftist agenda that seeks to distort American history and values. He argues, "If you’re not facing stark opposition to what you’re doing, you’re not doing enough.” By taking a stand, Walters believes he is pushing back against a concerted effort to undermine American principles in education.</p>
<h3>Inspiring National Change</h3>
<p>Walters is confident that Oklahoma’s initiative will serve as a model for other states. He asserts, "We are going to be so proud here… to be the first state in the country to bring the Bible back to every single classroom.” His ambition is to encourage other states to adopt similar policies, creating a ripple effect across the nation. "Every state should be doing this,” he stated, underscoring the need for a collective movement to reclaim educational values.</p>
<p>Support from President Trump has further amplified Walters’ efforts. He noted that Trump has praised their initiative, which aligns with the former president’s broader goals of restoring traditional educational values. With Trump’s backing, Walters believes their project will gain traction, positioning Oklahoma at the forefront of a national educational reform movement.</p>
<h3>The Fight Against Leftist Ideologies</h3>
<p>Walters is adamant about the ideological battles currently playing out in schools. He argued, "The Democrats have pushed graphic pornography on your kids. They have told your kids that there are different genders.” He believes that the left’s agenda is fundamentally at odds with the values that he and many Oklahomans hold dear. By reintroducing the Bible into schools, Walters aims to counteract this perceived moral decay, emphasizing the need for students to "understand America’s greatness.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, he is vocal about the urgency of this initiative, especially in light of upcoming elections. "We have to get that done,” Walters insisted, indicating that the current political climate presents a unique opportunity to enact meaningful change. He views his efforts as part of a larger fight against what he describes as a "Marxist dumpster fire” threatening the nation’s core values.</p>
<h3>Return to the Bible</h3>
<p>Ryan Walters’ initiative to put Bibles in Oklahoma classrooms represents a bold step toward reclaiming educational standards and values. With significant financial backing and a commitment to overcoming opposition, Walters aims to inspire other states to follow suit. His collaboration with President Trump amplifies the significance of this movement, marking it as a pivotal moment in the fight against leftist ideologies in American education. As Walters passionately stated, "We will not back down to the woke mob,” signaling a determined effort to restore what he believes is a crucial part of America’s heritage.</p>
