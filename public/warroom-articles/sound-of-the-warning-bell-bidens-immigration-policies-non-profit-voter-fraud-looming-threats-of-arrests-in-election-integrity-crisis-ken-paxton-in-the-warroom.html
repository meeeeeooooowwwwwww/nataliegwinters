<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a stern warning on Thursday’s WarRoom about the potential for widespread voter fraud in the upcoming elections, driven by illegal immigration and the activities of specific non-profit organizations. Paxton told Harnwell he sounded the Warning Bell over what he had learned and said he hoped people would fight illegals voting now and not wait until after the election.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“We have to do what we can—right now. Do something now. Nothing can be stopped after the election,” he warned, adding: “The time to act is before the votes are cast, not after the results are in.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Paxton’s message to those considering voting illegally was equally direct: “You may try to vote in this election, but you may end up in prison for it.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Paxton, known for his unwavering stance on election integrity, expressed deep concern that the Biden administration’s policies deliberately undermine the integrity of the electoral process.</p>
<p>Paxton began by recalling the Biden administration’s decision on day one to halt deportations, a move he believes sent a clear signal to the cartels and illegal immigrants: the United States would take care of them. “I was suspicious from the beginning when Joe Biden, on day one, announced he wouldn’t deport anybody. Like, why would you do that on day one? He wanted to signal to the cartels, get people here, and they don’t have to run anymore; we’ll take care of them,” Paxton remarked. He suggested that this was not just an act of humanitarianism but part of a broader strategy to alter the demographics of key states to benefit the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>According to Paxton, one of the most alarming aspects of this strategy is the role of non-profit organizations in registering voters. He pointed out that these organizations have been actively involved in voter registration drives on state property, particularly at motor vehicle departments.</p>
<p>“We started becoming suspicious when we saw these non-profits were out on big police property where they register people for driver’s licenses. And people get registered to vote using a normal process. We were curious. It’s already giving you your driver’s license. You can automatically register.  Why would you need another special non-profit group registering people unless the people being registered outside are not qualified to be registered inside?” Paxton asked, highlighting the suspicious nature of these activities. His office is still investigating the full extent of these efforts, but the implications are troubling.</p>
<p>Paxton did not mince words when he spoke of the broader plan behind these actions. He believes that the Obama-Biden administration, unable to win elections legitimately, has orchestrated a scheme to use illegal immigrants and fraudulent voting practices to secure electoral victories.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I’m sounding the warning bell now,” Paxton declared. “This is happening all over the country. This was a plan by the Obama-Biden regime to bring in people to vote because they can’t win elections without some of these illegal voting schemes that they put together, including mail-in ballots, which they did last time.” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Paxton’s message was clear: this is not a localized issue but a nationwide threat to the integrity of American democracy.</p>
<p>Paxton emphasized the urgency of addressing this issue before it is too late. His words serve as both a deterrent and a call to action, urging all who care about the country’s future to take these threats seriously and act immediately to safeguard the integrity of the upcoming elections.</p>
