<p>On January 13<span>th</span>, the voters of Taiwan are expected to choose freedom and reject enslavement by the Chinese Communist Party. But the CCP’s dictator, Xi Jinping, has chosen otherwise and is now poised to impose his will on the Taiwanese, and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Even if the United States were indifferent to such a development on the other side of the world, we will not be spared its repercussions. And that is not simply because Taiwan’s conquest would deny us the currently irreplaceable source of advancedchips essential to every aspect of our economy and national security. Neither is it just a matter of the dire, knock-on effects for the Free World of losing one of its most strategically located and exemplary, if largely unsung, members.</p>
<p>No, Xi’s ambitions towards Taiwan are also an incalculable danger for us because of what he intends to do to ensure that America will not interfere with their realization. In short, the Chinese Communist emperor is now ready to neutralize, if not destroy, this country <span>from within.</span></p>
<p>Xi Jinping has carefully set the stage for such a move by unleashing his proxies to ignite conflagrations across the globe. Such serial acts of "strategic arson’ to date include the wars he greenlighted in <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-is-ukraine-the-ccps-first-front/"><span>Ukraine</span></a>, <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-international-arson-is-the-ccp-sparking-world-war-iii/"><span>Israel</span></a> and <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-bonfires-of-the-tyrannies-now-the-ccp-friends-are-igniting-a-tanker-war-in-the-mideast/"><span>the Red Sea</span></a>. Several others could be torched on at any time in places like: <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-korean-war-2-0-xis-next-act-of-strategic-pyromania/"><span>the Korean peninsula</span></a>; the mouth to the Mediterranean Sea; the Horn of Africa, and/or Nigeria; or northeastern South America.</p>
<p>Xi’s pyromania thus far has had several predictable effects. The <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-is-joe-biden-a-controlled-asset-of-the-ccp/"><span>CCP’s "controlled asset”</span></a> in the White House, Joe Biden, has obliged Beijing by dissipating official U.S. attention, financial and military resources and national prestige on what have, in every case, been ineffectual responses. In the process, Team Biden has materially reduced our ability to deter, let alone decisively defeat, China’ own aggression in the Western Pacific and beyond.</p>
<p>Worse yet, the Obama-Biden 3.0 administration has allowed Xi to emplace tinder <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-kinetic-war-on-the-u-s-home-front-the-ccps-plans-to-attack-america/"><span>inside this country</span></a> that will allow him to engulf it in flames, too – literally as well as figuratively – at any time. The CCP has reason to believe it can, perhaps by helping instigate <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-a-new-u-s-civil-war-made-in-china/"><span>civil strife</span></a> or even <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-chinese-carry-out-a-ccp-biowarfare-lab-in-california/"><span>mass destruction</span></a>, preclude the U.S. military from projecting power from the mainland, and maybe even destroy this country. The Chinese Communists may, as Sun Tsu urged, be able to "win without fighting,” or at least win at an acceptable cost.</p>
<p>Of particular concern is Xi Jinping’s successful infiltration of large numbers of unaccompanied, military-age and fit Chinese men across our <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-usa-betrayed-taking-down-the-border-taking-down-america/"><span>southern border</span></a> effectively dismantled by President Biden. While the total quantities are not known with certainty, the <span>New York Times</span>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/china-migrants-us-border.html"><span>reported</span></a> that 24,000 entered in the last year. The <span>New York Post</span>
<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/02/news/chinese-nationals-crossing-into-us-reaches-new-high/"><span>reported</span></a> that there has been a 7000% increase since 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/672573409/Letter-to-DHS-on-Chinese-Nationals-at-the-Border"><span>A letter</span></a> sent by five U.S. Senators to Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas in September 2023 noted:</p>
<p><span><span>We write to you with concern that over 18,000 Chinese nationals have illegally crossed the southern border in Fiscal Year 2023</span></span><span><span>1</span></span><span><span>, with some of these individuals having ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</span></span><span><span>2 </span></span><span><span>July set the record for nationwide encounters with Chinese nationals with just over 6,100. 94.8 percent of Chinese national encounters in FY23 have been single adults. This trend poses a significant threat to our national security and warrants immediate attention and action from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). </span></span></p>
<p>An Iranian man <a href="https://t.co/2OWenzgaBY"><span>interviewed</span></a> by Real America’s Voice reporter Ben Bergquam shortly after he entered the United States illegally asserted that the vast majority of the Chinese whom he saw doing the same were military age and traveling without family members. While <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/may/19/tiktok-posts/no-evidence-that-chinese-immigrants-at-us-southern/"><span>Politifact</span></a> would have us believe "[There’s] no evidence Chinese immigrants at U.S. southern border are ‘troops,’” Army veteran-turned-combat journalist <a href="https://presentdangerchina.org/webinar-countdown-to-the-ccps-shooting-war-the-latest-indicators/"><span>Michael Yon</span></a> is among those who has closely observed andinteracted with such nationals from China and concluded that some are "obviously” military personnel.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <span>Daily Caller</span>
<a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/02/dcnf-reporter-describes-how-chinese-illegal-immigrants-get-fast-tracked-to-us/?pnespid=srM6EDRAb7lH1_Kb_CnlGpPT5h_8CIAuPeu8mfpxqgBmfm_SKKcMKQQHkAZuW7FPN0XI3NAL"><span>reported</span></a> last week that, in April 2023, key Customs and Border Patrol personnel were directed to cut back on the vetting of illegal aliens from China, reducing the number of questions they are asked from 40 to just 5. According to Daily Caller’s Phillip Lenczycki:</p>
<p><span>What we found is that the questions that are remaining, according to the individual who shared the email with us on the condition of anonymity, fearing U.S. government reprisal, his opinion, as well as an expert’s opinion, is that in effect this has sped up the flow, it has increased the speed at which the agents are processing and admitting Chinese illegal immigrants into the United States</span><span>….</span><span>It has lowered the bar for them to enter.</span></p>
<p>In addition, former CIA undercover operative Charles "Sam” Faddis <a href="https://andmagazine.substack.com/p/i-guess-we-know-now-what-31-million"><span>revealed</span></a> that the practice of scrutinizing the cell phones carried by these Chinese men for evidence of their background and contacts has been eliminated, as well.</p>
<p>The dangers posed by the multiple divisions-worth of People’s Liberation Army personnel evidently now in America are all the greater insofar as it appears we not only are unclear about their numbers, but clueless also their whereabouts and capacity to engage in espionage, sabotage against critical infrastructure and institutions, assassinations, mass destruction, etc.</p>
<p>As questions posed by the five Senators last September that were aimed at illuminating such data have apparently gone unanswered by Secretary Mayorkas, we can only assume the worst. That is especially so since the FBI is fully engaged with its largest investigation ever against <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/epochtv/therealstoryofjan6part2-5548012?ea_src=frontpage&amp;ea_med=lead-story-medium-0"><span>patriotic Americans</span></a> in connection with January 6<span>th</span>, and thus failing utterly to perform its vital counter-intelligence mission of detecting and thwarting <span>real </span>threats in this country – like an army of PLA special forces in America.</p>
<p>In light of the distinct prospect that Saturday’s election in Taiwan may provide the pretext for Xi Jinping’s aggression against that island, preceded by an order to his own special forces units here – and perhaps the CCP’s jihadist allies, also in the United States in unknown numbers – to begin attacks inside our wire, we must immediately take, among others, the following steps:</p>
<div>1) Seal the southern border to prevent still more enemies from entering.</div>
<div>2) Direct all available FBI investigative and law enforcement personnel to stand down on further pursuit of January 6<span>th</span>-related targets. There should be no further congressional action on the location or construction of a new FBI building until such wasteful – if not actually, criminal – behavior is terminated.</div>
<div>3) Focus such resources instead on an emergency basis to help locate, round up and incarcerate or deport immediately Chinese and jihadist operatives. At a minimum such an effort may force them to go to ground and upset their timing or ability to act on orders from Xi or his proxies.</div>
<div>4) Stop all financing of the CCP and its People’s Liberation Army by Wall Street using the pension funds, mutual funds and other investment vehicles of the American people.</div>
<div>5) Aggressively pursue the impeachment of Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas on, among other charges, treason for their complicity in destroying the southern border and facilitating its penetration by Chinese Communist Party military elements and Sharia-supremacist jihadists bent on waging war against us, from within.</div>
