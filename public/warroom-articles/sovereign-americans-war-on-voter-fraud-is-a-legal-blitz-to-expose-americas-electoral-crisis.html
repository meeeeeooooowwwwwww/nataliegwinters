<div>
<p>Thursday on the War Room, Marley Hornik, Executive Director of<a href="https://unite4freedom.com/"> United Sovereign Americans</a>, illuminated the growing concerns around election integrity with a bold declaration: her organization is pursuing several high-stakes lawsuits to rectify systemic voter registration and participation issues.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The importance of these lawsuits cannot be overstated. Hornik explained, "When a state actually grants access to the Ballot Box equally to an invalid registrant as a demonstrably, proven validated, verified citizen voter, they are committing a count of federal election fraud.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Hornik’s revelations, which she shared with WarRoom host Dave Brat, and the subsequent legal actions she described expose the critical need for more transparency and accountability in the electoral process.</p>
<p>The WarRoom is encouraged to participate with Hornik and her group.</p>
<p>Hornik presented startling findings from her organization’s investigations on the program. These investigations uncovered 29 million "facially invalid” voter registrations across 20 states. She described these registrations as "literally people who are, according to the state registered to vote before they’re born, registered on January 1st from 1900 to 2022, or registered after having cast votes.”</p>
<p>According to Hornik, these irregularities point to potential election fraud, emphasizing that such issues are not mere clerical errors but severe flaws in the integrity of the voting system.</p>
<p>The impact of these invalid registrations is profound. Hornik reported that 10 million votes were cast by individuals with questionable registrations in the 2022 midterms alone. She highlighted the gravity of the situation by noting, "One out of every three votes counted in Franklin County, Ohio, came from a registrant with a state registration date of January 1st.” This example is particularly significant given that the election involved crucial amendments to Ohio’s Constitution, including changes to abortion laws.</p>
<p>Hornik’s group is actively addressing these concerns through legal action. "United Sovereign Americans is filing a lawsuit today in federal court in Ohio to match our existing litigation already pending in Maryland and Pennsylvania,” she revealed.</p>
<p>The lawsuits aim to enforce legal standards and ensure that only eligible, verified voters influence election outcomes. Hornik’s strategy includes targeting states with severe voting integrity issues, with upcoming lawsuits planned for North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Georgia, and Colorado.</p>
<p>Hornik’s commitment to addressing these issues reflects a broader concern for the health of American democracy. "This is the most important process we do as a country,” she asserted. "Everything that all of your guests today have talked about turns at the ballot box, who’s in charge of this country—the elites or the American people.”</p>
<p>Her focus on legal action to uphold democratic principles highlights the need for vigilance and accountability in the face of potential electoral abuses.</p>
<p>Hornik urged citizens to support their efforts, emphasizing the need for both financial and participatory contributions. "We have lawsuits teed up for Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas. And our next targets are Florida, Michigan, Georgia, and Colorado. We need your help,” she said, calling for involvement in safeguarding the democratic process.</p>
<p>Hornik’s legal battles are a crucial part of the ongoing fight for election integrity. Her efforts represent a concerted push to ensure that the electoral system remains fair, transparent, and representative of the American electorate.</p>
