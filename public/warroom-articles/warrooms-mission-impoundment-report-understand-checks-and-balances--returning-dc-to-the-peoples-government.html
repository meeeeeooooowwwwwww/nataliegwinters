<h3>A Vision for Change</h3>
<h4>Washington, D.C., must return to its roots—a government of, by, and for the people—accountable, balanced, and transparent. Steve Bannon and constitutional advocates like Mark Paoletta from <a href="https://americarenewing.com/">the Center for Renewing America</a> are pushing for this with bold ideas to restore checks and balances- on Thursday’s WarRoom.</h4>
<p>Resources for this report understand the Constitutional Power of Impoundment:</p>
<h3>Restoring Checks and Balances</h3>
<p>Bannon’s message is clear: "The Constitution gives us the framework; we just need to enforce it.” On Thrusday while talking to Paoletta, he emphasized the importance of checks and balances, explaining how current systems fail. Congress is too often a bystander, allowing unchecked power in the executive branch.</p>
<p>The solution? Congress must reclaim its role. Bannon underscored, “It’s about accountability. No one person or office should dominate. That’s what our Founders intended.”</p>
<h3>Impoundment: The Forgotten Power</h3>
<p>What is impoundment? It’s a president’s ability to refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. Bannon and constitutional voices believe it’s a key to stopping wasteful government overreach.</p>
<p>Critics call it extreme, but advocates like Bannon disagree. "Impoundment is not radical,” he explained. "It’s a tool to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly.”</p>
<p>Impoundment, a term that once held significant weight in American governance, has resurfaced in recent discussions about restoring balance between the executive and legislative branches.  Bannon, along with Mark Paoletta other constitutional advocates, has argued strongly for the reassertion of <strong>impoundment</strong> powers. Impoundment allows the President to refuse to spend funds that Congress has allocated, essentially putting a check on potentially wasteful or unnecessary government expenditures.</p>
<p>In their discussion Thursday in the WarRoom, Bannon stressed that this power is rooted in the Constitution, which empowers Congress to control the purse. However, over time, presidents have largely bypassed this tool, choosing to work within a system where they don’t have to confront Congress on spending decisions. Bannon pointed out, "The Founders intended for checks on the executive, and impoundment is one of the most powerful tools Congress has—yet it’s rarely used.” He emphasized that this power isn’t about overreach; instead, it’s a measure of fiscal responsibility and control.</p>
<p>The need for impoundment is especially critical today, as government spending has soared to unsustainable levels. Bannon and others believe that by reintroducing impoundment, presidents would be forced to justify their spending more carefully. This, in turn, would encourage the executive branch to work more closely with Congress, ensuring that every dollar spent aligns with the people’s needs rather than executive preferences. Bannon argued, “Impoundment isn’t radical. It’s a tool to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly.”</p>
<p>Critics of impoundment, however, argue that it could undermine Congressional authority, essentially giving the President unilateral power to withhold funds. But Bannon and his allies maintain that the executive must be accountable, and Congress must reclaim its responsibility to oversee government spending. The goal, as they see it, is to restore the checks and balances that keep the federal government in check and ensure it truly serves the people.</p>
<p>Highlighting this, checks on reckless spending could dramatically limit executive overreach, returning financial power to Congress where it belongs.</p>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>This approach isn’t just about saving money. It’s about restoring the balance of power. Without it, the people lose control over how their money is used.</p>
<h3>The People’s Government</h3>
<p>Washington DC doesn’t belong to the elites. It belongs to you. Let’s take it back.  The America First movement isn’t about partisanship. It’s about accountability. Returning D.C. to the people is a non-negotiable.</p>
