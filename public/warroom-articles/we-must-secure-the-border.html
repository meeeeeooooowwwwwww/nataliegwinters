<div>
<p>If a country doesn’t have a secure border, then it doesn’t have national security. That isx one of the critical lessons I learned during my 22-year career in the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Right now, due to Washington Democrats and Joe Biden’s failed open-borders policies, the United States of America does not have anything resembling national security.</p>
<p>I’m running for Congress in North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District to restore our country’s southern border and stop the flow of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs into our communities.</p>
<p>Thousands of illegal immigrants are pouring across our southern border every day. In September, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported that total <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/30/record-setting-260000-migrants-crossed-southern-border-in-september-report/">migrant encounters exceeded 260,000</a>, a new record.</p>
<p>As a result, every town across the country is a border town. Crime is going up. Drugs are pouring in. And our children are paying the price for Democrats’ refusal to crack down on illegal immigration. Between 2020 and 2021, overdose deaths in North Carolina <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2023/02/21/north-carolina-reports-22-increase-overdose-deaths">increased by 22%</a>, driven by illegally manufactured fentanyl coming across our southern border.</p>
<p>And if the flow of illegal drugs wasn’t bad enough, terrorist organizations are taking advantage of the porous southern border. The number of individuals on the terror watch list apprehended trying to cross the southern border illegally has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/number-people-terror-watchlist-stopped-mexico-us-border-risen-rcna105095">nearly doubled</a> in the last year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t know who has slipped in undetected. Law enforcement officers recently arrested a <a href="https://13wham.com/news/nation-world/ice-arrests-african-terrorist-in-new-york-who-entered-us-via-southern-border-nyc-ice-border-wall-trump-biden-texas-arizona-california-customers-border-patrol-cbp-hamas-israel">29-year-old man</a> in New York City wanted for terrorist activities in Senegal. He entered through the southern border.</p>
<p>This ongoing crisis we are currently facing was not always the case. Just three years ago, the United States did not have this problem. Thanks to the policies enacted by President Donald Trump, our border was secure.</p>
<p>Under Joe Biden and Democrats’ failed policies, illegal immigrant crossing has reached record highs for three straight years. <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters">According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data</a>, border encounters averaged 266,000 per month in 2023. For perspective, that’s five times the monthly average under President Trump’s final year in office.</p>
<p>The Trump administration prioritized the safety of U.S. citizens and U.S. communities. We need a president who will put America first, which is one of the main reasons why I have endorsed Donald Trump for president.</p>
<p>If North Carolinians send me to Washington, here are three policies I am prioritizing to get our border crisis under control.</p>
<p><b>Fully secure the border.</b> Fully securing the border includes completing the border wall, increasing funds to ensure our border patrol and law enforcement officers have the necessary resources, and deploying technology to the southern and northern borders to track and deter border crossings.</p>
<p><b>Deal with the failed policies Democrats and President Biden have allowed that encourage illegal immigration.</b> These policy changes include ending catch and release, reforming the asylum process, and strengthening laws to protect unaccompanied minors from human trafficking.</p>
<p><b>Modernize the legal immigration system</b>. We need to prioritize merit-based immigration for family members of existing U.S. citizens and reduce the lengthy process for people who have played by the rules.</p>
<p>Our country can’t afford to keep on this path. We need to elect leaders willing to crack down on the drugs and crime pouring through our southern border because Democratic leaders in Washington refuse to take this issue seriously. I believe I have the experience and policy ideas to make a difference, and I look forward to earning the support from North Carolina’s 13th District to get this done. Failure is not an option.</p>
