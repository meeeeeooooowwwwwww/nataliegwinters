<p>A WarRoom “Call to Action” has been designated after a Tuesday firey exchange between the Director of Federal Prisons, Colette S. Peters and U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL). Tensions were elevated when Gaetz requested a congressional visit to Danbury Prison in Connecticut to see Steve Bannon. Gaetz explained that he and others from the committee wanted to visit Bannon and asked if there would be any issues in approving this visit in the next few weeks. He was met with what appeared to be delay tactics.</p>
<p>The clip of Gaetz questioning Peters went viral with millions of views.</p>

<p>GOP brings in the Federal Bureau of Prisons Director to ask her to bypass protocol so they can visit Steve Bannon in prison. </p>
<p>Just put your damn selves on his visitor list and quit with this performative BS at the taxpayer’s expense. <a href="https://t.co/8LecwL74e5">pic.twitter.com/8LecwL74e5</a></p>
<p>— Outspoken™️ (@Out5p0ken) <a href="https://twitter.com/Out5p0ken/status/1815830941727629582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This activity has resulted in an elevated WarRoom-style call to action to contact Congress about the illegitimate nature of the J6 Committee for their abusive punishments of Bannon and others:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Gaetz exchange happened during the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. The hearing, “Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons,” examined the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) operations, management, and staffing challenges.</p>
<p>Under intense government scrutiny, Peters responded by stating that the request could be reviewed and considered once submitted to the Office of Legislative Affairs, appearing to brush Gaetz off.</p>
<p>Gaetz pressed Peters for a more direct commitment to approve the visit, seeking a straightforward confirmation. However, the Director repeatedly emphasized that the approval process involves the Office of Legislative Affairs and maintained that there is a long-standing procedure in place.</p>
<p>Gaetz challenged this response, noting that Peters was testifying before an oversight subcommittee, which implies that the committee has some authority in such matters, likely referring to a bill that has been passed and is awaiting Democrat Joe Biden’s signature.</p>
<p>Despite this, Peters maintained that while they encourage cooperation, the approval process is formal and requires departmental review, causing the public to note that she was stalling.</p>
<p>Gaetz expressed frustration with what he perceived as bureaucratic red tape and criticized the “arbitrary standards” and “non-answers” provided by Peters.</p>
<p>He urged for even more robust oversight from the House committee, suggesting that without such scrutiny, the lack of clear answers and accountability would persist.</p>
<p>This stalling by Peters has resulted in elevating greater concern over Bannon’s treatment as a political prisoner ahead of a historic election in November, as well as drawing more scrutiny to other political prisoners from J6.</p>
<p>Bannon<a href="https://warroom.org/bannon-calls-for-bipartisanship-and-transparency-in-a-new-january-6th-committee/"> has repeatedly called for a bi-partisan</a> House Committee to investigate J6.</p>
<p>A call to action has been sent out for the WarRoom Posse to call their members of Congress and voice their concern over this troubling set of circumstances surrounding the incarceration of Bannon and all J6 political prisoners, as the US House has now<a href="https://warroom.org/fight-for-freedom-house-gop-challenges-jan-6-committee-in-steve-bannons-appeal-as-political-prisoner/"> filed their legal documents this week</a>, to condemn the Democrat-dominated J6 House Committee as a sham- no one should have been punished from their<a href="https://warroom.org/bannon-case-takes-center-stage-as-republicans-rally-against-jan-6-committee/"> partisan investigations</a>:</p>

<p><strong>SENATE HAS PUSHED AHEAD ON ACTION</strong></p>
<p>Concerns about Peter Navarro’s punishment and Bannon’s, as well as other J6 political prisoners and their punishment, happen during a rare show of bipartisanship, as the U.S. Senate has approved a bill aimed at overhauling the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The legislation, spearheaded by Senator Jon Ossoff, seeks to strengthen oversight of the BOP following a series of scandals and criticisms about its operations. These issues include reports of staff corruption, inmate mistreatment, prison closures, and delays in implementing the First Step Act, which is intended to reduce recidivism and reform sentencing laws.</p>
<p>Now heading to President Biden’s desk, the bill marks a significant step towards addressing these systemic problems.</p>
<p>Senator Ossoff has been a vocal advocate for reforming the BOP, having held hearings on egregious issues such as the “rape club” scandal at FCI Dublin women’s prison and widespread corruption at USP Atlanta, which is now a low-security facility.</p>
<p>These investigations have underscored the urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of the federal prison system, which has been plagued by issues such as staffing shortages, inadequate medical care, and decaying facilities.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), led by Michael Horowitz, issued a <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-report-federal-bureau-prisons-efforts-maintain-and-construct-institutions">report in May</a>. The OIG’s reports detail numerous issues within the BOP, including unsanitary conditions, poor healthcare, and infrastructure in dire need of repair. The new bill, known as the <a href="https://www.ossoff.senate.gov/press-releases/breaking-senate-passes-sens-ossoff-braun-durbin-rep-mcbath-armstrongs-bipartisan-federal-prison-oversight-act/">Federal Prison Oversight Ac</a>t, mandates the OIG to conduct thorough inspections of all 122 BOP facilities. These inspections will be risk-based, with facilities deemed higher-risk receiving more frequent evaluations. The OIG will then report its findings to Congress and the public, while the BOP will be required to respond with a corrective action plan within 60 days .</p>
