<p>Steve Bannon host of War Room is joined by former Navy intel officer Jack Posobiec and national security expert L Todd Wood to breakdown the attempted coup by the Wagner group in Russia. Posobiec and Wood react to the initiating event of the air strike by the high command aimed at Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. Wood points out aspects of Russian defense that are weak such as the national guard and calls it a civilian operation. Bannon adds to Woods case by highlighting the corruption of Russian generals.</p>
