<p>Melody Jennings of <a href="https://www.cleanelectionsusa.org">Clean Elections USA</a> gives host Steve Bannon an update on the battle of MAGA forces to be able to observe elections and prevent fraud. Despite the complaints of liberals that patriots are intimidating voters, Jennings says it is just the opposite.</p>
<p>“We have the footage showing that these people and people with Clean Elections were just sitting quiet… minding their own business … and it was the news and some people …who discovered them who said let’s find them and make this crazy… We actually have the footage of this person from their personal camera, and it literally tells a different story. … We have footage of the news staging a story.”</p>
