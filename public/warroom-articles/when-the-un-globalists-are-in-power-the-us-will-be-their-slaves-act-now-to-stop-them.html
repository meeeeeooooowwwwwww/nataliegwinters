<p>Michele Bachman appeared on Thursday’s WarRoom with warnings of UN threats to US Sovereignty by a UN vote mandating Israel’s withdrawal from key territories and the potential expansion of UN authority through upcoming global agreements. Bachmann argues that these developments significantly threaten national sovereignty and U.S. policy.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“These countries are all run by the billionaire class, right? It’s not just the countries decide to do this stuff. So who’s pulling the strings? And who wants to? Ultimately run the world, why it’s the richest people in the world, the richest corporations in the world, and you have to look no further than the world economic Forum. That’s the crowd. That means in Davos about every six months they offline in in their private jets and decide how we’re going to become slaves to them, “Bachman told WarRoom host, Dave Brat on Thursday. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In response to these threats, Bachmann urged Americans to take action by signing a petition at StopWorldGovernment.org. She believes mobilizing public support and influencing political leaders, including former President Trump, is crucial in countering these globalist initiatives.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"Please everyone go to StopWorldGovernment.org,” she implored. "We need to get this to President Trump so that he can weigh in on this.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, Bachmann’s remarks highlight her concerns about the growing influence of global governance bodies and their potential impact on U.S. sovereignty and international alliances.</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINTS FROM BACHMAN:</strong></p>
<p>UN Vote on Israel: Michele Bachmann highlighted a recent United Nations vote that passed with overwhelming support, demanding Israel vacate Judea, Samaria, and parts of Jerusalem within 12 months. "There was a consequential vote taken yesterday at the United Nations and it passed overwhelmingly,” Bachmann reported. Only 14 countries opposed the measure, signaling broad international backing for the resolution.</p>
<p>US Influence at the UN: Bachmann emphasized the significant role of the United States in the UN, noting that the U.S. contributes over 25% of the UN’s budget. She argued that the U.S. could use its financial leverage to block unfavorable resolutions. "The United States is more clout than anyone at the United Nations,” she stated. "We pay over 25% of all the dues and if we want to, we can shut down any vote at the U.N.”</p>
<p>Upcoming Global Agreements: Bachmann expressed concern about the "Summit of the Future” and the "Pact for the Future,” scheduled to be discussed at the UN. She warned that these agreements would further consolidate global authority under the UN, potentially compromising national sovereignty. "On Sunday, something very important is going to happen. It is called Summit of the Future,” she explained. The pact aims to enhance the UN Secretary-General’s power over international crises and global governance.</p>
<p>Impact on US Policy and Israel: The discussion also touched on recent U.S. policy decisions, including Vice President Kamala Harris’s stance on military aid to Israel. Bachmann criticized Harris’s position, stating, "Kamala Harris just said she is not going to be forgiving ammunition to the Jews.” She framed this as part of a broader pattern of undermining support for Israel amid ongoing conflicts.</p>
<p>Call to Action: Bachmann urged Americans to sign a petition at<strong>
<a href="https://stopworldgovernment.org/">StopWorldGovernment.org</a>
</strong>to oppose the UN’s increasing control over national policies. She also suggested that former President Trump could play a critical role in countering these developments if re-elected. "Please everyone go to StopWorldGovernment.org,” she urged. "We need to get this to President Trump so that he can weigh in on this.”</p>
<p>Bachmann raised the alarms about the significant United Nations vote that demands Israel’s withdrawal from key territories, including Judea, Samaria, and parts of Jerusalem. During her discussion with Brat, Bachmann emphasized that this resolution, which passed overwhelmingly with only 14 countries dissenting, poses a severe threat to Israeli sovereignty and security. She explained that the resolution mandates Israel vacate these areas within 12 months, a move she described as deeply troubling.</p>
<p>Bachmann also highlighted the substantial influence of the United States within the UN, noting that the U.S. contributes over 25% of the UN’s budget. "The United States is more clout than anyone at the United Nations,” she stated. Despite this, she warned that without a decisive response, the U.S. could lose its ability to shape UN decisions. Bachmann argued that the U.S. could potentially block such resolutions by leveraging its financial contributions, but this would require a proactive stance.</p>
<p>Adding to her concerns, Bachmann discussed upcoming global agreements like the "Summit of the Future” and the "Pact for the Future,” which are set to expand UN authority. She criticized these agreements for consolidating power within the UN, potentially undermining national sovereignty. "On Sunday, something very important is going to happen. It is called Summit of the Future,” she said. The pact aims to grant the UN Secretary-General increased control over international crises and global governance, a development she fears will erode national autonomy.</p>
<p>The conversation also touched on recent U.S. policy decisions regarding Israel. Bachmann took issue with Vice President Kamala Harris’s statements on military aid to Israel, arguing that Harris’s reluctance to support Israeli defense efforts aligns with a troubling trend of weakening support for the Jewish state. "Kamala Harris just said she is not going to be forgiving ammunition to the Jews,” she criticized.</p>
