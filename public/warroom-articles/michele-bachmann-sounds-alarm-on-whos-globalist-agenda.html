<p>Former US Congresswoman Michele Bachmann appeared on the WarRoom and emphasized the <strong>significant structural changes being pushed through with the help of the Democratic administration of Joe Biden within the World Health Organization (WHO), which will effectively transform a branch of the</strong>
<strong>United Nations into a global law enforcement body</strong>. She highlighted her efforts to combat this shift through her involvement with sovereigntycoalition.org, where she opposes the recent pandemic treaty and the WHO’s expanded authority over the United States.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“This was initiated by the Biden Administration. They’re the architect of all of these International changes. And so the Biden Administration is all for globalism. They’re all for the international control over COVID type diseases in the future at the international level.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bachmann appeared with Steve Bannon on Monday to discuss the WHO’s hoped-for transformation. She told Bannon that she is educating and training PhD students at Regent University to understand and address these international relations and public health policy changes. She stressed the importance of resisting these new regulations and maintaining national sovereignty against the WHO’s growing influence.</p>
<p>Bachmann delivered a stark warning about recent developments, asserting that the organization’s changes grant it unprecedented global control. She began by lamenting what she saw as a tragic outcome in Geneva, where WHO amendments were pushed through at the last minute, violating their own procedural rules.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“They violated all their process rules and they just jammed literally at the last minute Saturday night when people weren’t paying attention, they jam through the Amendments what they intended to put through in the first place.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>According to Bachmann, these amendments effectively institutionalized the COVID-19 regime in place for the past three years. She expressed concerns that the WHO now has the authority to mandate vaccines, testing, and medications and even restrict the right to travel internationally. Bachmann highlighted the Biden administration’s role as the architect of these changes, emphasizing their push for globalism and international control over pandemic responses.</p>
<p>Bachmann’s critique extends beyond the WHO’s actions in Geneva. She also criticized President Biden’s recent remarks regarding Israel and Hamas. Biden’s statement, suggesting that Israel had proposed a deal that was a Hamas victory, drew sharp rebuke from Bachmann. She accused Biden and his administration of political maneuvering, suggesting they were motivated by electoral concerns rather than sound foreign policy.</p>
<p>In response to Biden’s recent comments, Bachmann reaffirmed Israel’s stance of defeating Hamas both politically and militarily. She criticized Biden for his apparent disregard for Israel’s security and accused him of lying to the American people. Bachmann told Bannon that she believes the Biden administration’s policies are detrimental to national and international interests.</p>
<p>Bachmann’s insights serve as a reminder of the ongoing debate surrounding global health governance and U.S. foreign policy. With the WHO solidifying its authority and geopolitical tensions persisting in the Middle East, the stakes remain high for policymakers and citizens alike.</p>
<p>As Bachmann warns against the dangers of unchecked globalism, her words echo the sentiments of many who fear the erosion of national sovereignty and the rise of supranational authority.</p>
