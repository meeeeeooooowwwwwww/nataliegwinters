<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4 Feb 25 [AM]</h2>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> February 4, 2025</p>
<p>Steve Bannon discusses the importance of Bobby Kennedy Jr.’s potential appointment as Secretary of Health and Human Services, linking it to the broader MAGA and “Make America Healthy Again” movements. He highlights how Kennedy’s advocacy aligns with the goals of challenging big pharma, the food industry, and agriculture. Bannon reflects on the shift in political views, mentioning Naomi Wolf’s transformation from a progressive to an ally in this movement, particularly focusing on concerns over the influence of big pharma in media advertising. Bannon praises Bobby Kennedy’s imperfections, drawing parallels to President Trump, Pete Hegseth, and Tucker Carlson, suggesting that these flaws make their work more effective. He emphasizes the growing support for Kennedy within the MAGA base, citing a pro-MAGA surgeon general from Louisiana backing him. Bannon explains the intricacies of the finance and health committees’ roles in the voting process, noting the significant financial interests involved. He also mentions Elon Musk, acknowledging differences but recognizing the potential for collaboration against shared enemies. Bannon alludes to historical alliances among rival factions and uses this to explain the current political landscape, where unusual alliances can form to advance common goals.  In this conversation between Tom Danz and Steve Bannon, Danz, speaking from southern Greenland, emphasizes the longstanding ties between the U.S. and Greenland, which are vital for understanding American strategic interests. He highlights a visit to the site of Bluey West One, a key World War II base, where the American flag flies at half-staff in remembrance of the sacrifices made by U.S. soldiers. Danz reflects on the role of Greenland in WWII and the tragic loss of U.S. Army transport ship Dorchester, which was torpedoed by a Nazi submarine, killing 672 men, including four chaplains from various religious backgrounds. These chaplains’ heroism is commemorated annually. Danz explains that Greenland’s importance lies in its strategic position, particularly during WWII when it became a key outpost after Nazi Germany invaded Denmark. The area’s geographical location is crucial today, especially in light of rising tensions with Russia. Bannon concurs, discussing how Greenland’s proximity to U.S. shores and its strategic role in countering Russian naval movements make it a key part of the "new great game” of global geopolitics, particularly in the Arctic. Danz also reflects on his time serving in President Trump’s administration, noting his work with the Arctic Commission and his efforts to highlight Greenland’s strategic significance. He calls for a renewed focus on Arctic policy and its importance to U.S. national defense. Danz encourages listeners to follow his new organization, American Daybreak, for further developments.  In this conversation between Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec, the discussion spans several issues involving China, Mexico, trade, and U.S. politics. Bannon criticizes the U.S. trade relationship with China and Mexico, highlighting how Chinese goods are being funneled through Mexico to bypass tariffs and claim a “Made in Mexico” label. He argues that this is a deliberate loophole exploitation that undermines American workers, with Chinese firms and workers involved in Mexican manufacturing. He stresses that the real trade war is between the Trump administration and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who have long collaborated with China’s Communist Party to benefit from globalization. The conversation then shifts to Tulsi Gabbard’s potential impact on U.S. intelligence, with Posobiec suggesting that her focus on restructuring intelligence agencies and taking on the massive budget could be a game changer. They also discuss the importance of Gabbard’s work with officials like Todd Young and her potential to influence national security. Posobiec briefly touches on rumors about returning to his intelligence work, but affirms his commitment to his current role. They wrap up by promoting Gabbard’s upcoming hearing and Posobiec’s live coverage on Twitter, urging viewers to stay engaged with the latest updates.  Natalie Winters talked about the details of her latest reporting.  In a revealing conversation, Larry Taunton shared his insights on the migration crisis and the role U.S. taxpayer dollars play in it. Taunton, who has spent five years tracking migrant caravans, highlighted the lack of questions about why people are coming to the U.S. from South and Central America. He explained that the failure of socialism in these regions, combined with U.S. agencies like USAID, is facilitating this migration, which he calls “human trafficking.” Taunton pointed out that NGOs, particularly those funded by USAID, are at the forefront of this operation, aiding the movement of migrants through treacherous routes like the Darien Gap. “These NGOs, including the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), are receiving millions of dollars to assist in this process,” he said. He went on to describe how these organizations operate in Colombia and Panama, with some migrants being moved to the U.S. without knowing their final destination. He also revealed that these efforts often involve cartels, with migrants paying hefty sums to be transported through dangerous areas. USAID’s involvement, through various NGOs, is a key factor in the continued flow of migrants into the U.S., and Taunton is calling for accountability. For more on his findings, he encourages listeners to follow his podcast Ideas Have Consequences.  Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the ongoing challenges of illegal immigration and the impact of U.S. foreign aid on the crisis. Bergquam highlighted ICE operations targeting criminal illegal aliens, noting that 58,000 criminals in New York alone are being pursued for deportation. He stressed the role of cartels and leftist politicians, with U.S. tax dollars allegedly funneled to support the illegal migration, and criticized the lack of accountability from the Biden administration. Bannon emphasized the need for transparency in tracing the flow of funds, particularly how money is channeled through various organizations, including charities that may be complicit in the crisis. Bannon endorsed a radical approach, calling for an investigation into the politicians and organizations involved in enabling illegal immigration, including Catholic Charities. He also called for defunding sanctuary cities and granting ICE more authority to apprehend individuals in prisons and jails. The conversation focused on the necessity of dismantling these systems to stop illegal immigration and hold accountable those behind it. Bergquam reiterated the importance of transparency and accountability, promising more updates through his show Law and Border. The duo stressed the urgency of the issue and the need for political action to address the border crisis. </p>
