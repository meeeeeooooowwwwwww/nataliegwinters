<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/22/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> July 25, 2024</p>
<p>In a recent War Room discussion, Dave Brat and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs discussed critical issues facing the nation, highlighting their frustrations with Washington’s bureaucracy and political accountability. The conversation opened with a tribute to Steve Bannon, emphasizing his resilience and the current political climate, which they described as a period where “weeks feel like decades.” The discussion centered around three major issues: the border invasion, two trillion dollar deficits, and endless wars, all of which Biggs asserts he consistently opposes. Brat commended Biggs for his unwavering commitment to truth, despite the challenges of operating within what he called “the swamp.” A significant portion of the conversation was dedicated to the Secret Service’s handling of a security breach involving a suspicious individual during a high-profile event attended by former President Trump. Biggs criticized the agency’s failure to maintain adequate security measures and suggested that the Secret Service did not act on critical information that could have prevented a potential threat. He emphasized the need for accountability and questioned whether the shooter acted alone, pointing to possible connections to someone associated with the FBI. Brat and Biggs also discussed the broader issue of accountability in Congress, lamenting the lack of consequences for bad behavior and fiscal irresponsibility. Biggs argued for defunding certain agencies and holding individuals accountable to curb abuses within the administrative state. He expressed disappointment with his colleagues’ reluctance to push for significant legislative changes. The conversation concluded with a plea for the release of Steve Bannon, whom Brat and Biggs consider a political prisoner. They criticized the judiciary’s treatment of Bannon and emphasized the importance of advocating for fair treatment. Biggs pledged to continue fighting for accountability and justice, stressing the need for strong leadership to address the nation’s pressing issues.  In this War Room conversation, Dave Brat and Catherine Engelbrecht discussed their ongoing efforts to ensure election integrity, emphasizing the critical nature of their work amidst political uncertainty. Engelbrecht praised as a War Room hero, explained the primary objectives of her organization, True the Vote, which focuses on enhancing the accuracy of voter rolls, addressing gaps in polling places, and encouraging volunteer involvement. She announced the launch of Vote Alert, an app designed to enable voters to report on-the-ground irregularities, and a Spanish version called Nesto, aimed at engaging the Latino community. Engelbrecht highlighted recent developments in Wisconsin, where the reintroduction of drop boxes has become a focal point of her group’s efforts. She emphasized working closely with local sheriffs to monitor these voting methods, aiming to prevent potential fraud. Brat and Engelbrecht expressed gratitude for the support from their community, recognizing the unsung heroes who contribute to these efforts. Engelbrecht urged the War Room Posse to take actionable steps by signing up at TrueTheVote.org for updates on projects and accessing the IV3.us app to monitor local voter rolls for ineligible records. She noted significant victories, challenging over 700,000 questionable records across 1,300 counties. Engelbrecht underscored the urgency of active participation by addressing the broader political landscape, viewing the current political climate as a spiritual battle requiring voter turnout and civic engagement. Engelbrecht and Brat acknowledged the uphill battle ahead, emphasizing the importance of unity and perseverance in defending fundamental liberties. Engelbrecht concluded by stressing the need for moral action, regardless of party affiliation, and called for renewed dedication to the cause of freedom and democracy.  This conversation on the War Room with Dave Brat and Alex DeGrasse discusses a broad analysis of the current political landscape, emphasizing key dynamics involving Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party’s strategy for the upcoming elections. The discussion begins with DeGrasse, Executive Director of Team Elise Stefanik, outlining the critical role of grassroots activism, encouraging supporters to engage as poll watchers and volunteers to secure the vote. He highlights a recent trend of increased enthusiasm among Democrats, particularly within the African-American community, following Harris’s growing prominence. The conversation focuses on Harris’s political position, noting her perceived weaknesses and potential impact as a candidate. Brat and DeGrasse discuss how Harris has assumed responsibility for many of President Joe Biden’s policies, painting her as an “enabler-in-chief” with policies positioned to the left of Biden. The conversation emphasizes Harris’s low approval ratings and job performance, branding her as a weaker candidate for the Democrats. However, DeGrasse notes the strategic challenge Republicans face, as Harris hasn’t been as thoroughly defined in the public eye compared to Biden. The hosts also discuss the possibility of significant moves by former President Obama, suggesting he might influence the Democratic establishment to support an alternative candidate. DeGrasse stresses the necessity for the Republican Party to capitalize on Harris’s weaknesses by emphasizing her policies, particularly her statements on immigration and other issues, in critical swing districts.  Natalie Winters opened the show with strong commentary on recent political events and controversies. She suggests there’s an underlying agenda to sideline Steve Bannon by keeping him in jail. Natalie assures listeners that War Room will prioritize the “signal over the noise,” providing clear insights into the complex issues at play. Winters expresses disappointment at accusations of sexism following criticisms of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies and affirmative action in hiring, specifically within the Secret Service and the events on Saturday, July 13, when President Trump was shot, along with three other Americans, one who died from his wounds. She references a statement by the DHS dismissing these concerns as sexist and argues against the notion that DEI policies are to blame for security failures. Winters argues that this is an intentional failure by the Biden administration rather than incompetence, questioning the regime’s actions across various fronts, including border security, the economy, and President Joe Biden’s mental health. She insists that blaming DEI policies gives the administration a way to dodge responsibility for these issues, particularly in the context of the alleged assassination attempt. Additionally, Winters criticizes Biden’s inadequate communication, referencing his unofficial endorsement of Kamala Harris and suggesting that his erratic behavior is a sign of his inability to lead the nation effectively. She calls for invoking the 25th Amendment, asserting that Biden is unfit for office. Winters concludes by warning that America’s adversaries—and even allies—are watching and laughing at the nation’s perceived weakness, suggesting that they see it as an opportunity to take advantage of a lack of strong leadership.  Part One: The discussion between Darren Beattie and Natalie Winters goes into the alleged incompetence and potential malfeasance within the Secret Service and its handling of recent security incidents. Beattie, a former Biden administration official, criticizes the Biden administration and Secret Service, specifically focusing on the agency’s response to security threats. He begins by commenting on the strange circumstances surrounding the alleged assassination attempt on July 13th and questions whether the failure to prevent it was due to “diversity” hires or a deliberate act by the “deep state.” Beattie argues that the incompetence displayed could either be criminal negligence or intentional complicity, suggesting that members of the Secret Service should face legal consequences for their actions. Beattie further analyzes the Secret Service’s response to the discovery of a pipe bomb near the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters on January 6, 2021. He highlights how the Secret Service’s response seemed suspiciously relaxed, allowing schoolchildren to pass near the bomb without immediate action. Beattie speculates that the agents might have known the bomb was fake, raising questions about how they could have known this in advance. This leads him to question the agency’s credibility and suggests a possible cover-up or intentional mishandling of the situation.  Part Two:  In a recent conversation on War Room, Natalie Winters and Mike Benz discussed the potential political downfall of President Joe Biden, particularly in light of a letter from former intelligence community members suggesting Biden step down. Benz had previously predicted that such a letter would signal Biden’s end due to his strong ties with the foreign policy establishment, or “the blob.” This establishment, which includes the State Department, Department of Defense, and CIA, has been Biden’s power base throughout his political career, as he was once dubbed “Mr. Foreign Policy” by the Council on Foreign Relations. Benz highlighted that 48 former members of the intelligence and national security community recently signed a letter suggesting Biden should resign, echoing the 51 signatories who previously labeled Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation. Among the signatories is Rosa Brooks, a former high-level Pentagon official and head of the Transition Integrity Project, which reportedly simulated strategies to ensure Biden’s presidency even if Trump won the election. Benz noted that on the same day as the letter’s release, a protest group called “Pass the Torch, Joe” emerged, calling for Biden to step down, drawing parallels to tactics used to challenge Trump. The conversation shifted to the influence of powerful entities like the Transition Integrity Project and figures like Nils Gilman and Reid Hoffman, who have been involved in controversial political maneuvers. They discussed how the concept of democracy is threatened by oligarchic networks willing to undermine elections to maintain power. The discussion also touched on theories surrounding an assassination attempt on Trump and the alleged role of certain individuals and groups. Benz noted parallels between the January 6 Capitol riot and other political events, highlighting concerns about democracy and governance manipulation. Part One:  Part Two:  </p>
