<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/13/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> August 14, 2024</p>
<p>Jerry Dunleavy, a former senior investigator on the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Afghanistan investigation, resigned in frustration over what he describes as an ineffective and unserious probe. Initially an investigative reporter covering the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, Dunleavy joined the committee to seek accountability. However, he found that witnesses were treated too gently, key figures were never called, and crucial questions were left unanswered. Dunleavy criticized Chairman McCaul for not fulfilling promises to thoroughly investigate the events, particularly regarding the bombing at Kabul Airport. He expressed deep concern that future military failures could lead to more unnecessary casualties without proper accountability. Dunleavy emphasized, “Inaction is really non-excusable,” especially when there’s power to compel testimony and documents. He hopes that public pressure might push the committee to fulfill its responsibilities.  Theo Wold argues that the recent surge in naturalization efforts is a strategic move by the left to reshape the electorate before the 2024 election. He points out that naturalization trends have declined over the last few decades. Still, recent efforts by the Biden administration are expediting the process to ensure new citizens can vote. Wold highlights the administrative state’s role in pushing policies they favor while dragging their feet on those they oppose, stating, "If it’s an idea they like, they’ll move expeditiously.” He warns that this selective efficiency could significantly impact the upcoming election, emphasizing the need for more robust policies to counteract these efforts.  Natalie Winters gave some of her thoughts and ideas on what the Deep State is doing.  In response to his ministry being entangled in legal battles initiated by Democrats just before their convention in Chicago, Mike Lindell is offering his book for free. The book details his journey to sobriety from crack addiction and the development of his ministry, which Democrats are now pushing to shut down.  Congressman Tim Burchett told the WarRoom that he has been actively working to address concerns about Tulsi Gabbard being placed on a “Quiet Skies” watch list, which has led to her being followed by agents through airports. Burchett finds this surveillance alarming and is demanding answers, emphasizing that if it can happen to her, it could happen to others. He criticizes unelected bureaucrats for overreaching and violating constitutional rights, likening the situation to other government abuses, such as labeling concerned parents and peaceful protesters as domestic terrorists. Burchett expresses frustration with the lack of accountability in Washington, blaming a system influenced by lobbyists and entrenched bureaucrats. He calls for a stronger push against wasteful spending and government overreach, criticizing both Democrats and moderate Republicans for their roles in allowing these issues to persist. Burchett also supports cutting bureaucratic staff in Washington by 75% and advocates for electing leaders like Matt Gaetz, who he believes stand firm against corruption. He warns that if these issues aren’t addressed, the country risks losing its freedoms and facing further bureaucratic abuses.  Dr. Robert Malone, in a discussion, expressed his views on the political dynamics surrounding Donald Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Malone suggests that Fauci, despite being lobbed softballs by CNN to paint Trump as a threat of political retaliation, did not take the bait. Instead, Fauci’s comments implied he does not expect a Trump administration to engage in political vendettas, unlike what Malone perceives as the approach taken by the Biden-Harris administration. Malone criticizes Fauci’s past actions and statements but notes a surprising neutrality in Fauci’s anticipation of Trump’s potential actions if re-elected. Malone interprets this as Trump focusing on broader issues rather than political revenge, despite ample reasons for accountability due to alleged lies to Congress by Fauci and his subordinates. Malone personally would favor seeing accountability but acknowledges the more pressing need for Trump to address larger national problems. He also mentions his upcoming speaking engagement at the Liberty Forum in Silicon Valley, where he plans to discuss topics like weaponized fear and psychological bio-terrorism. Malone’s analysis reflects a complex interplay of political expectations and personal convictions regarding justice and governance priorities.  Father Calvin Robinson and Lawrence Fox shared their views on the state of politics and society in the UK during their appearance on War Room. Robinson, who was blocked from ordination in the Church of England due to his “biblical views on gender and sexuality,” expressed concerns about the lack of representation for the working-class in Britain. He appreciated Elon Musk’s recent comments about civil unrest, stating, “Thank goodness we have an ally,” highlighting the establishment’s disconnect from ordinary citizens. Fox, head of the Reclaim Party, echoed these sentiments, criticizing the current political landscape: “We have a uni-party because we have a two-party system.” He lamented the lack of true opposition to what he described as a “far-left government” and warned that the British people lack a political voice, leading to potential unrest. Both Robinson and Fox agreed that the UK’s two-tiered system is deeply problematic, with Robinson emphasizing that “we live in a two-tier society,” where people from certain demographics face harsher consequences for minor infractions while others commit serious crimes with impunity. They concluded that people power might be the only solution to the deep-seated issues facing the nation, with Fox predicting that future protests could see “a million” people marching, forcing the government to take notice.  Todd Bensman, reporting from Panama’s Darien Gap, highlights the region’s critical role as a migration bottleneck where over 1.5 million migrants, including individuals from Muslim-majority countries, Africa, and China, pass through on their way to the U.S. border. Bensman underscores the national security threat posed by this route, noting that Panama has recently captured several terrorists among the migrants. Despite Panama’s new president, Raul Molino, vowing to close the Darien Gap and deport migrants instead of releasing them, he faces challenges due to the lack of promised support from the U.S. “Where are the Americans? They’re gone. You promised us aid and assistance, and there’s nothing going on with that,” Bensman quotes Molino. This failure to act, Bensman argues, is a missed opportunity to enhance U.S. national security. He also criticizes the U.S. diplomatic approach, emphasizing the need for stronger measures, such as sanctions or visa restrictions, to incentivize cooperation from transit countries like Colombia. Bensman warns that the migration crisis will continue to escalate without decisive action.  Billboard Chris Elston criticized the controversial practice of drag queen story hours for young children. He argued, “They’re trying to recruit little kids into the cult of gender into queer Theory,” calling it a misguided effort to normalize gender transitions among children. He highlighted the alarming statistics on gender dysphoria treatments, noting, “More than 300,000 children aged 12 to 17 have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria,” and criticized the trend of performing surgeries on minors, including “6,000 double mastectomies” in recent years. Elston also stressed that this issue resonates strongly with voters. “The loudest cheers at Trump’s CPAC speech came when he vowed to stop the chemical castration of children,” he said, indicating widespread public concern. He believes that action from all branches of government is necessary, urging legislative and judicial interventions to halt what he describes as “child abuse.” Elston presents a stark call to action, emphasizing the urgent need for both effective border management and protective measures against the sexualization of children. “Parents need to put their foot down,” Chris concludes, underscoring the critical nature of these issues in shaping the future of U.S. policy.  </p>
