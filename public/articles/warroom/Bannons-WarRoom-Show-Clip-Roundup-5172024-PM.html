<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5/17/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> May 18, 2024</p>
<p> Highlights: Laura Loomer talked about her investigations into the daughter of the judge who is over the Trump trial in New York City that exposes Democrat US Rep. Dan Goldman. Amy Kremer talked about her race for GA for national committeewoman. Mike Davis released his newest video about President Trump for the Article 3 project, a parody of the lawfare against President Trump. Mike Lindell talked about the changes to Minnesota’s state flag and the reactions of the state citizens. Kash Patel talked about his newest WarRoom Op-Ed and the lawfare against President Trump. Tulsi Gabbard talked about the news that NATO is entertaining the conflict in Ukraine. Jeffrey Tucker talked about his book Life after LockDowns and some new government reports showing that the government made a mess of COVID protocols. Reccomended Reading: The Constitutional Guillotine: The End of the Deep State Kash Patel, Former National Security Prosecutor and Deputy Director of National Intelligence Full show in segments: Laura Loomer shared her investigations into Judge Merchan and his daughter.  Loomer uncovered ties between the Merchan family and US Rep Dan Goldman, a Democrat and an outspoken critic of President Trump. Loomer investigated through open source documents at the FEC and found more suspicious between the judge’s family and Democrats who are active in committee activity against Trump.  Amy Kremer reported live from the Georgia GOP convention, where she is running for National Committeewoman for the Republican Party. She also reported on some Georgia politics, including important updates on cases against President Trump and election integration developments.  Mike Davis released a new video parodying the lawfare facing President Trump. Davis talked about the cringe-y real-life lawfare attempts to keep Trump away from campaigning. He suggested that the House investigate a possible criminal conspiracy against him and his supporters. Davis has been consistent on that message for a long time and reaffirmed that he believes the Republicans have all of the legal authority to dig deeper into what Trump’s opponents have done to keep him from campaigning.  Mike Lindell updated Steve Bannon and the WarRoom on developments with people he knows who were frustrated about the change in the State of Minnesota’s flag.  Lindell said their state flag had been changed to an Islamic flag by changing the 5-point start to an 8-point star.   Steve Bannon reminded the audience that the transformation of state flags was also happening in other states.  Kash Patel gave updates on his book Government Gangsters and also talked about an Op-Ed he has up on the WarRoom.org site. Patel said that he believes the end of the Deep State is not far behind because when President Trump gets back in power, the Constutition will be restored and will act as a tool that they will not like. Mentioned: The Constitutional Guillotine: The End of the Deep State Kash Patel, Former National Security Prosecutor and Deputy Director of National Intelligence  Joe Allen talked about his late research on transhumanism and what he described as Demonic Degeneracy at Eurovision. Allen spoke about the loss of humanity with these movements, with people gravitating to them for power and creating a new spirituality that appears to be aligned with demons and the occult.  Tulsi Gabbard joined Steve Bannon and talked about why she did not support NATO entering into the Ukraine war and what she believed would lead to a disaster for the United States.  Gabbard also spoke about her association with President Trump and her book, For Love of Country, and what motivated her to write the book.  Natalie Winters talked to Jeffrey Tucker about the timeline for COVID and the government’s denials about making mistakes on their protocols, which eroded so many freedoms for Americans. Trucker talked about where he believed the loss of trust in government was headed after they made so many mistakes and seemed unable to fix what they started.  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history. </p>
