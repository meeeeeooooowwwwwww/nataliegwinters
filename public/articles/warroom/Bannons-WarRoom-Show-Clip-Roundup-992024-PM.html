<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/9/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> September 9, 2024</p>
<p>On Monday’s WarRoom, Ben Bergquam criticized the Biden administration for abandoning border wall materials, wasting taxpayer money, and allowing the border to remain porous. He highlighted the story of Coptic Christians from Egypt who were held captive by the Sinaloa cartel for 12 days while attempting to seek asylum in the U.S. Bergquam argued that Biden and Harris’s border policies enable cartels to exploit vulnerable migrants and facilitate drug and human trafficking. He emphasized the ongoing crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, accusing Biden and Harris of lying about border security. He warned that the continued neglect of immigration issues would lead to the collapse of American sovereignty, stressing that the future of the country hinges on strong border enforcement and leadership change in Washington.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene voiced strong criticism of the Biden administration’s handling of illegal immigration, the Ukraine war, and the two-tier justice system. She condemned the impact of immigration on small towns, describing how the influx of migrants has overwhelmed local resources. Greene cited "unbelievable” reports of pets being harmed and schools being strained due to an influx of non-English-speaking students. She also accused Biden of failing to prioritize American needs, lamenting that seniors are “literally eating dog food” while funds are sent abroad. Greene criticized the Justice Department’s treatment of January 6th defendants, claiming a two-tiered justice system. She highlighted how innocent people, including veterans and grandmothers, are being unfairly prosecuted while cities like Washington D.C. face rising crime. Greene called for greater accountability and action ahead of the 2024 election, insisting that Americans are fed up with the current administration’s policies and the justice system’s perceived bias.  Natalie Winters shared her frustration with illegal immigration and with Mike Rogers.  At Club 47 in Palm Beach County, there was a special screening of the documentary Government Gangsters, based on Kash Patel’s book. The film highlights the actions of the Deep State, covering scandals like Russiagate and the Hunter Biden laptop controversy. It also criticizes figures like FBI Director Christopher Wray and former Director James Comey, exposing their alleged misconduct. The documentary supports Donald Trump and critiques political dynasties like the Bidens, Clintons, and Cheneys. The discussion touched on Liz Cheney’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, seen as part of the political establishment’s opposition to Trump’s anti-war policies. The film tour is set to continue nationwide.  In a discussion between Brian Schimming, Wisconsin GOP chairman, and Jayne Zirkle, Schimming highlighted the strong support for Donald Trump during a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, where over 10,000 attendees gathered. Schimming emphasized key issues driving Republican support in the state, notably the economy, inflation, border security, and violent crime. He described how illegal immigration is impacting local communities and noted the GOP’s focus on election integrity, recruiting 6,000 poll workers and deploying thousands of observers. Schimming also addressed the challenge of mobilizing new voters, including college students and groups like hunters who may not traditionally vote Republican but align with key issues like the Second Amendment. He emphasized the importance of early voting and grassroots efforts, primarily through the Trump campaign’s “Trump Force 47” initiative, aimed at recruiting volunteers and reaching out to neglected voter bases. Schimming concluded by urging active participation in the final critical weeks leading up to the election, stressing that saving America is the ultimate goal.  Jayne Zirkle and Mike Gableman discussed the significant impact of a recent shift in the Wisconsin Supreme Court from a conservative to a liberal majority. Gableman criticized the court’s recent ruling, which allowed unsupervised ballot drop boxes, overturning a previous decision that had banned them. He expressed concerns that this ruling could lead to absurd situations, such as ballots being collected in unsecure places. Gableman also emphasized the importance of voter turnout, urging people to pray and work diligently to ensure that Donald Trump is supported in the upcoming election. He stressed the need for active engagement and outreach to increase voter participation, especially given the narrow margins in past elections. Additionally, Gableman criticized Wisconsin’s Republican leadership, particularly Speaker Robin Vos, for his perceived lack of support for Trump.  Jayne Zirkle and Sam Markstein discussed the recent Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) conference in Las Vegas, highlighting its significance given the recent turmoil in the Middle East. Markstein emphasized that the RJC remains crucial in the political landscape, particularly in light of the tragic Hamas attacks and the murder of six hostages. He noted the Republican Party’s strong support for Israel, contrasting it with what he views as inadequate support from the current administration. Markstein criticized the Biden administration’s handling of international relations and anti-Semitism, citing the increased influence of Iranian-backed groups and anti-Semitic incidents on U.S. college campuses. He praised President Trump’s past policies, which he believes ensured better security for Jewish communities and a firmer stance against terrorism. Markstein expressed hope that Jewish voters will continue to lean towards the Republican Party, as demonstrated by growing support in key battleground states. He urged listeners to engage with and support the RJC for continued advocacy and influence.  Noah Formica, a grassroots leader with Turning Point Action in Pennsylvania, discussed the upcoming debate watch party at the Greater Philly Expo Center with Scott Pressler. He highlighted the event’s importance for rallying supporters and focusing on key issues for Pennsylvania voters. Formica hopes President Trump will emphasize his stance on oil and gas policies, gun rights, and his opposition to Kamala Harris’s proposed regulations. He also addressed concerns about voter integrity, noting that local GOPs are working to highlight issues with mail-in ballots and voter registration. Despite challenges, Formica reported a strong push to engage voters and improve mail-in ballot efforts, with notable progress in GOP requests compared to Democrats. He encouraged supporters to follow him on Twitter and engage with Turning Point Action through their website. </p>
