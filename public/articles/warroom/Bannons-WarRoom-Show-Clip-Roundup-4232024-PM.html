<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/23/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 24, 2024</p>
<p>Steve Bannon hosted the Evening WarRoom program and Natalie Winters hosted the evening WarRoom Battleground. Cold Opens for the evening WarRoom program was footage from corporate media with talking heads deconstructing the Trial against Donald Trump and introducing Steve Bannon’s name into the conversation. Ben Bergquam, who was present in the courtroom then, reported during his segment that when Bannon’s name was introduced, it caused such a stir that the court had to be in recess for some time. Winters played cold opens that showed Joe Biden talking about a climate crisis. Highlights: Steve Bannon continued to expose Speaker Mike Johnson for not protecting President Trump, pushing for a criminal conspiracy. Ben Bergquam talked about what he had seen in the streets of New York, at NYU, where a wall has been constructed to control rioting, and highlights from Trump’s trial. Garret Ziegler reported on an update about the lawsuit Hunter Biden has brought against Marco Polo over publishing contents of Hunter’s abandoned laptop. Julie Kelly reported on the unconstitutional nature of the lawfare being used on President Trump and talked about a new report she has published on classified documents. Mike Lindell talked about deals for the WarRoom audience. Dave Walsh reported on the left’s use of Earth Dave to drive up the cost of living for Americans for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party. Col. John Mills discussed warfare tactics and the upcoming ‘Summer of Love’ riots ahead of the 2024 election. Dr. Naomi Wolf spoke about fertility and COVID. Bradley Devlin Editor of American Conservative, reported on the process for the Foreign Aid spending bill. Jim Hoft talked about a recent report on election integrity. Reccomended reading: Julie Kelly Tweet about Judge Cannon likely shows criminal conspiracy Complete show in Segments: Bergquam reported two New York universities where protests are unfolding: NYU Protests: Over 120 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were arrested at NYU for defying a university order to leave.
A plywood wall was erected around NYU’s Gould Plaza in response to the protests. Bergquam said that most of those arrested were released on trespassing summonses, while a few received desk appearance tickets for charges like resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration. Columbia University: Bergquam said that President Menouche Shafik faces calls to resign due to ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at the Ivy League school’s Morningside Heights campus.   He said he spoke with students who opposed Israeli military action in Gaza and demanded divestment from companies they claim "profit from Israeli apartheid.”
An encampment was set up on Columbia’s South Lawn, coinciding with the college president’s testimony on campus antisemitism after the Hamas attack on Israel. Bergquam reported that these protests involve elements of Antifa, Black Bloc, and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While primarily driven by the Sharia supremacist movement, there are broader dynamics at play in these demonstrations. The situation remains tense, and the goal is to insulate campuses while addressing the underlying issues.  Garrett Ziegler reported that he is heading to Nashville to give a talk on the controversial laptop issue. The talk will take place at the Hyatt House in Franklin, starting at 6:30 PM Central Daylight Time. Ziegler emphasized the importance of this laptop issue, highlighting the lack of mainstream support for his cause and the legal challenges he’s facing. He discussed the lawsuit against him regarding the laptop data and invited attendees to learn more about the topic. Ziegler stresses his commitment to the truth and encourages people to hear his perspective firsthand at the event.  Steve Bannon criticized several figures, including Jim Jordan and Mike “Polly Pockets” Johnson, accusing them of enabling a conspiracy to undermine the country. He argues that House Republicans are complicit in efforts to harm Trump and prioritize political gain over justice. Bannon called for action to expose and combat these alleged injustices, expressing frustration with the lack of action and demanding that Republicans defend Trump and his mission vigorously.  Crom Carmichael emphasizes the importance of maintaining heart health and managing cholesterol levels. He shares a testimonial from a satisfied customer who experienced a significant drop in cholesterol levels after using their product. Hearts encourages listeners to visit warroomhealth.com and use the code “warroom” at checkout to access a special offer on their subscription program. He highlights the effectiveness of their product and expresses gratitude for the opportunity to share it with the audience.  Julie Kelly reveals bombshell revelations on a classified documents case involving Trump. The scheme aims to drain Trump’s energy and resources to hinder his campaign efforts against Biden. Bannon says that it is a criminal conspiracy orchestrated by the Biden administration, DOJ, and intel community to entrap Trump. Despite Kelly’s viral tweets and detailed coverage, Republican leadership remains silent, focusing on trivial matters instead of addressing this significant issue.  Mike Lindell discusses a product called the roll-and-go travel pillow that features the American flag and a five-point star, which resonates with the audience’s patriotism. He emphasizes that customers who use the promo code “war room” on the website to make any purchase today will receive one of these pillows for free. He also mentions other specials available on the site, including discounted sandals and bathrobes. He thanks the audience for their support, noting that their purchases have helped the company’s factory reach full capacity again. Lindell ends by reminding listeners to stay safe during travel and promises to continue discussing the ongoing criminal conspiracy on the show tomorrow.  Bradley Devlin from The American Conservative joins the show to discuss Speaker Mike Johnson’s and Senate counterpart Mitch McConnell’s failures. He highlights how McConnell’s focus on Ukraine and Israel’s aid over securing the southern border reflects the establishment’s priorities, which diverge from those of Republican voters. Devlin expresses hope for a conservative reversion in the future but acknowledges the challenges faced by figures like Johnson who are influenced by intelligence agencies and proximity to power. The conversation delves into the disconnect between the establishment’s priorities and the concerns of conservative voters, emphasizing the need for alignment within the Republican Party.  Jim Hoft from The Gateway Pundit joins the discussion to shed light on what he believes is a critical issue for the 2024 election: fraudulent voter registrations. Hoft emphasizes the importance of cleaning up voter rolls to prevent Democrats from gaining an unfair advantage through inflated voter numbers. He highlights a report from True the Vote, which revealed 1.7 million suspicious voter registrations in Texas, indicating potential voter fraud. Hoft suggests that Democrats rely on these fraudulent registrations to secure additional votes, especially in battleground states. He cites examples from Michigan, where thousands of fraudulent registrations were tied to leftist organizations. Hoff expresses concern that Democrats are orchestrating a strategy to manipulate voter registrations to their advantage, potentially impacting the outcome of the election. He urges vigilance and calls for action to crack down on fake voter registrations to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process.  Dave Walsh discusses recent legislative moves by the Biden administration that seem to prioritize environmental policies over American energy security. He criticizes initiatives like endorsing Deb Haaland’s plan to restrict oil and gas drilling in Alaska, which he sees as detrimental to American interests. Walsh highlights the administration’s focus on incentivizing rooftop solar installations over utility-scale solar projects, which he believes is a misuse of funds. He suggests that these policies will increase the cost of living for average citizens and ultimately benefit China, which has gained a dominant market share in electrical equipment supply for power generation. Walsh implies that there may be financial motives behind these policies and suggests a connection between academic research funding and the promotion of climate change ideology.  Dr. Naomi Wolf discusses new data regarding fertility and reproductive issues potentially linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. The data, obtained from the Ontario health insurance plan billing code data via freedom of information requests, indicates a significant increase in fertility problems, menstrual disorders, miscarriages, and male infertility following widespread COVID-19 vaccination in Canada. This large-scale analysis, conducted by the Canadian COVID Care Alliance and presented by Amy Kelly of Daily Cloud, reveals alarming trends in female and male reproductive health post-vaccination. The findings underscore the urgent need for further investigation and raise concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility. The full analysis is available on dailycloud.io, where readers can also support the War Room Daily Cloud’s efforts in bringing attention to critical issues like these.  Colonel John Mills discusses the tactics of China’s fifth-generation warfare, focusing on its efforts to disrupt the elections in Taiwan. He highlights the role of social media platforms like TikTok in spreading misinformation and manipulation, citing examples of influencers spreading false narratives to create mistrust and division. Mills also emphasizes the importance of on-the-ground collaborators in executing these operations effectively. Additionally, he discusses the situation in Niger, criticizing the State Department’s prioritization of certain issues like transgenderism over national security concerns. He argues that the failures in Niger are indicative of broader issues within the State Department and questions the expertise of its diplomatic core.    "In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.</p>
