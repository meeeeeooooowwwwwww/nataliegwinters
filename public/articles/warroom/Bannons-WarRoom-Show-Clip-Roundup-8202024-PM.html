<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/20/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> August 20, 2024</p>
<p>Julie Kelly discussed potential cover-ups involving missing Secret Service text messages from January 5th and 6th, 2021. She highlighted that these messages, belonging to at least 24 Secret Service officials, including key personnel like the director and Kimberly Cheatle, were deleted, raising concerns about obstruction of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General, Joseph Cuffari. Kelly pointed out that DHS attempted to prevent Cuffari from accessing related emails and other correspondence and even sought to redact portions of the report before it was released to Congress and the public. She emphasized the broader implications of this cover-up, suggesting it reflects a “systemic” effort to withhold critical information from the public. Kelly also noted that despite being labeled as conspiracy theorists, those questioning the official narrative have been vindicated as more information comes to light. She concluded by mentioning the developing scandal, including recent concerns raised by Senator Charles Grassley about DHS’s handling of the investigation into the alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13th. Kelly described these events as part of a larger interagency cover-up, including the ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden and related political figures.  Natalie Winters outlined her reasoning for resisting party unity with Republicans before the November election. They discussed her negative feelings about them and why she is frustrated.  Theo Wold criticized the Democrats’ newly codified platform as radically transformative, particularly concerning immigration policies. He highlighted that the platform endorses the Citizenship Act, which proposes to legalize 15.5 million undocumented immigrants who entered unlawfully under President Biden. The Act also offers these individuals free housing, healthcare, and legal representation and introduces the term “prospective lawful immigrant” to replace “illegal alien,” thereby eliminating distinctions between citizens and foreign nationals. Wold argued that the Act would also expedite green card eligibility for illegal immigrants, even those with criminal records, and shockingly, use taxpayer money to bring deported individuals back to the U.S. for citizenship. He described the platform as a fundamental, anti-American transformation, blending Marxist, feminist, queer theory, and open borders policies to erase distinctions between American citizens and foreign nationals. Wold questioned whether Republicans have the political will to combat this radical shift and expressed concerns about the feasibility of mass deportations, emphasizing the need for more stringent immigration enforcement and the use of modern tools to discourage illegal immigration. He also criticized former Republicans who now oppose Trump, accusing them of supporting this radical agenda out of personal animosity.  Mike Benz criticized the Democrats’ platform as fundamentally radical and anti-American, particularly focusing on immigration policies. He emphasized that the platform’s endorsement of the Citizenship Act would legalize millions of undocumented immigrants, offering them free housing, healthcare, and legal representation. Benz noted that the Act eliminates the distinction between citizens and foreign nationals by replacing terms like “illegal alien” with “prospective lawful immigrant.” He argued that this approach effectively dissolves U.S. sovereignty and expedites citizenship for even those with criminal records. Benz also highlighted the platform’s broader agenda, which he described as a mix of Marxist, feminist, and queer theories aiming to erase the difference between tax-paying citizens and foreign nationals. He questioned whether Republicans have the resolve to oppose this shift and criticized former Republicans who now oppose Trump, accusing them of enabling this radical agenda out of personal animosity.  Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell discussed their concerns over Steve Bannon’s treatment by the Bureau of Prisons, alleging that Bannon is being unfairly targeted by Attorney General Merrick Garland’s office. Giuliani emphasized his experience running the Bureau of Prisons, noting that Bannon is being treated differently than other prisoners, with his case seemingly manipulated at higher levels of government. Lindell supported these claims, stressing the importance of alternative media platforms like Frank Speech to counter mainstream narratives. He also promoted his MyPillow products, tying them to the broader effort to support Bannon and the War Room. Lindell shared his experiences of being attacked by various authorities, including the Minnesota Attorney General, who he claimed was targeting his charitable efforts. Both Giuliani and Lindell framed these issues within a broader context of political warfare, emphasizing the importance of resisting what they view as an increasingly authoritarian government.  Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell criticized the handling of a political convention, particularly the late-night timing of a speech, suggesting it was intentionally scheduled to minimize viewership. They speculated that the speaker might harbor resentment for being sidelined, leading to his exclusion from more prominent time slots. Lindell emphasized the importance of alternative media, like Frank Speech, to highlight disillusioned Democrats now supporting Trump, with plans to feature interviews showcasing their reasons for switching allegiance. The conversation also touched on Giuliani’s and Lindell’s concerns about political persecution, referencing Steve Bannon’s imprisonment and the broader implications for free speech and political dissent. They encouraged their audience to stay informed and support efforts to challenge mainstream narratives. </p>
