						<p>Natalie G. Winters, born on February 24, 1999, in California, USA, making Natalie's current age 23 years old.</p>
						<p>Details about Natalie Winter's parents and early upbringing remain private, as Natalie tends to keep her personal life out of the public eye. However, it's known that she was raised in California, where she developed a passion for journalism and politics from a young age after a mean girls incident at her high school sparked by a speech Natalie made. This early incident and Natalie's patriotism paved the way for her future endeavors in media, investigative reporting, Entrepreneurship, cultural commentary and fashion.</p>
						<p>After completing her education, Natalie Winters rejected a position with the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pentagon (DoD)</em></a> when, during her interview, she was told that her open concerns in regards to the cosy relationship between China and the US establishment would see her career fly as about as high as a large sack of concrete thrown by a wet cat on a rainy day. Miss Winters then chose instead to embark on her journalism career, quickly making a name for herself with her incisive reporting and dedication to uncovering the truth and has been fast embraced by those who recognise her courage and strength as a beautiful young patriotic and sensible young American woman. Her role as Steve Bannon's co-host of the internationally renowned <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34721650/?ref_=nmbio_mbio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>"War Room"</em></a> has further amplified her influence, allowing her to reach a broader audience internationally and solidify her position as a rising star in international conservative media and as an inspirational influencer on various social media platforms.</p>
