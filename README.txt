**This theme was based on the details below (Helios) but has since had mnany custumiSations.. I recommend you start with the original theme which is available for free with a few mere Google searches (because I'm too lazy to do them for you right meow and put the links here for yuo).**

Original website theme creators notes below:

Helios by HTML5 UP

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

This is Helios, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It's clean, modern, and designed
to take advantage of larger (well, wider) displays while still being capable of gracefully
scaling down to fit all manner of smaller ones.
