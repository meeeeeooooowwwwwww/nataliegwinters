                <h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 6/19/2024 [AM]</h2>
                <div class="article-content">
                    (Originally aired 6/18) In a discussion with Steve Bannon on the WarRoom program, attorney Cleta Mitchell expressed concerns about election integrity in Georgia, attributing issues to a deep state within election offices nationwide. Mitchell traced the origins back to a 2013 declaration by left-wing leaders to spend millions altering America’s political system, focusing on election processes, campaign finance laws, and judicial confirmations. Mitchell highlighted significant financial investments by leftist billionaires and foundations since 2013, estimating $11-14 billion spent to transform voting methods. She described a deep state within election offices that trains and indoctrinates officials, creating a robust infrastructure for mail-in voting.  Steve Bannon lambasted the mainstream media, particularly targeting Rachel Maddow. He mocked Maddow’s emotional responses and predicted advertisers would flee from her show due to their unpopular stance. Bannon also derided accusations against Trump, calling the charges “phony” and criticizing left-wing efforts to portray Trump as a threat to democracy. Bannon praised “Project 2025,” a comprehensive 885-page plan prepared by conservatives, showcasing their readiness for the next election. He accused the Biden administration of being out of touch with American voters, blaming their radical policies and incompetence for losing public support. Bannon alleged that left-wing billionaires have spent billions to influence elections, describing this as an attack on democracy. He dismissed Maddow’s warnings about the end of democracy as out of touch, claiming that American voters see through the deception. Bannon emphasized the importance of grassroots movements and the working class, asserting that they are now aware of the misleading narratives pushed by the left. He concluded by predicting a political shift favoring conservatives in upcoming elections.  Steve Bannon commented on the failure of Kevin McCarthy’s political maneuvers, highlighting the defeat of McCarthy-backed candidates despite substantial financial support. Bannon criticized McCarthy’s strategy, emphasizing the deep unpopularity of his brand. He argued that only Donald Trump can lead the GOP, dismissing Ron DeSantis’s and Nikki Haley’s prospects as unrealistic. Bannon highlighted Trump’s unique role in the “American experience” and predicted his inevitable return to the presidency. Bannon also discussed the broader political landscape, expressing disdain for the establishment and media figures like Rachel Maddow. He claimed that the 2020 election “steal” was providential, revealing to Americans the corruption in the system. Bannon stressed that the MAGA movement, fueled by the working class, will not tolerate further deceit. Bannon mentioned ongoing issues like deficit spending and the handling of illegal immigration, asserting that the government is lying about the true costs. He promoted “Project 2025,” aimed at dismantling the administrative state. Bannon concluded by stating that the elite’s control is slipping, with the MAGA movement gaining momentum as Americans reject the current establishment.  John Solomon and Steve Bannon discussed documents revealing Hunter and Joe Biden’s alleged corruption involving Burisma. Solomon reported that Hunter Biden and his partners secured a deal to funnel $120 million from Burisma to a company in Liechtenstein, giving them a 25% stake in future revenue without any investment. This occurred just before Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma. Solomon highlighted that the FBI had these documents since 2016 but withheld them during Trump’s impeachment, which could have altered the proceedings had they been disclosed. The documents, obtained from Hunter’s business partner Devin Archer, show the influence-peddling scheme and the FBI’s awareness of it. Solomon criticized the FBI for not acting on this information, suggesting political motives. Bannon and Solomon questioned why the Obama administration, particularly FBI leaders like Comey and McCabe, didn’t address these issues, speculating that concerns about Joe and Hunter Biden’s activities were known but not acted upon to avoid political fallout. Solomon emphasized the importance of Congress demanding any briefings that Obama and Biden received about Hunter’s activities, asserting that this could clarify their awareness and inaction, making the scandal more comprehensible to the public.  Steve Bannon discussed the challenges facing the U.S. dollar and the implications of the recent CBO report, emphasizing the erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power. He highlighted that the BRICS nations are gaining geopolitical strength, particularly in Eurasia and Ukraine. Bannon criticized the U.S. government’s financial mismanagement, leading to massive deficits and a potential devaluation of government bonds, as evidenced by a Japanese bank’s decision to sell $61 billion in U.S. government securities. Bannon suggested that financial elites and hedge fund managers recognize the impending financial crisis, driving them to buy gold. He urged viewers to educate themselves on macroeconomics and capital markets to become self-reliant. Bannon also condemned the excessive government spending, which he termed as “human bondage,” benefiting only the elite while burdening the average American. He called for a change in management and more accountability, expressing support for political figures like Bob Good and Eli Crane, who oppose excessive spending. Bannon warned of a potential revolution if financial mismanagement continues, noting that younger generations are becoming increasingly aware and disillusioned with the current economic system. He emphasized the need for active participation and control to bring about change.  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discussed the negative impact of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s financial policies, criticizing his misleading claims of deficit reduction. Bannon emphasized that McCarthy’s long-term deficit reduction plans are deceptive, with no immediate spending cuts. Brat praised Bob Good for addressing key issues like border security, deficits, and debt. They highlighted the alarming rise in the U.S. deficit, with a May deficit of $347 billion suggesting an annual deficit potentially reaching $3.5 trillion. Brat pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) underestimated the deficit by 27%, primarily due to rising interest expenses. He criticized the CBO’s persistent rosy projections influenced by Wall Street’s preferences. Bannon and Brat underscored the severe economic challenges facing young adults, likening them to “new Russian serfs” due to financial mismanagement. Brat also noted that Goldman Sachs is betting against middle-class consumers, indicating a bleak outlook for the economy. They called for urgent action to curb government spending and restore fiscal responsibility, warning that the current trajectory threatens the nation’s economic stability and burdens future generations.  Steve Bannon emphasizes the urgent need for grassroots activism to counteract a system that erodes liberty and freedom. He frames the current state of affairs as a spiritual and materialistic battle over money and power. Bannon credits the American people for resurrecting Donald Trump politically against formidable opponents like Rachel Maddow and Merrick Garland. He views Trump’s actions as pivotal in saving the Republic from decline, preventing a potential takeover by forces like the Clintons in 2016 and challenging the outcome of the 2020 election. Bannon stresses the importance of American citizens reclaiming their centrality in national priorities, advocating for a shift away from policies that exploit the working and middle classes. He invokes the sacrifices of military personnel throughout history as a reminder of the values America should uphold, calling on citizens to embody the spirit of change necessary to reform the current system.  EJ Antoni and Steve Bannon discuss the dire economic situation facing the United States, emphasizing widespread deception by government institutions regarding job numbers and economic health. They criticize entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics for misleading the public with inflated job growth figures, which do not reflect reality. Bannon predicts that escalating deficits and debt will ultimately burden the middle class through either inflation or increased taxes, highlighting the systemic failures in fiscal management. Both stress the importance of grassroots activism and skepticism towards institutional narratives, urging Americans to reclaim their agency in shaping national policies. They argue that elites manipulate information to suit their agendas, undermining public trust and perpetuating economic inequality. Antoni condemns this manipulation as a betrayal of citizens who deserve transparency and accurate data to make informed decisions about their futures. The conversation underscores a call for accountability and a renewed focus on addressing systemic economic challenges through honest discourse and grassroots mobilization.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discuss Anthony Fauci’s latest book tour, criticizing Fauci for narcissism and using the tour to bolster his image and criticize President Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Winters highlights how Fauci portrays himself heroically while attacking figures like Peter Navarro, positioning his narrative as a cultural weapon against the MAGA movement. Bannon expresses disdain for Fauci’s perceived arrogance and misleading statements, referencing the metaphorical phrase “heads on pikes” as a criticism rather than a literal call to action. They anticipate dissecting Fauci’s falsehoods and media manipulation on their upcoming show, aiming to expose his inconsistencies and the media’s role in amplifying his narrative. Winters invites viewers to tune in for a critical analysis at 6 PM, emphasizing the need to challenge Fauci’s version of events and his influence on public perception.
