                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/18/2024 [PM] Important Talking Points- Kill The Rule [ACTION]</h1>
                <div>Steve Bannon, Natalie Winters, Mike Lindell, and a panel of guests anchored the WarRoom for Thursday night WarRoom and WarRoom Battlefield live from the Ahern Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The focus of the discussion was election integrity, with many audience members participating with the hosts to ask questions about the different legal cases currently in the courts addressing the use of machine tabulators in the 2024 election. Important Action Steps: In a conversation with Russ Vought, Bannon asked him for recommendations on when the WarRoom Posse should call and contact their reps.  Vought told Bannon that the Possee members must say to their repos to  “absolutely vote against the rule.  They need to vote against the procedural changes. That we do not want to fund the war in Ukraine. Keep the focus on the main thing that we are opposed to, which is this third-party payment of an endless war, and it is the rule we oppose. You have to be specific and vote against the rule,” Vought said, adding: “And everyone’s doing a fantastic job of it. When we make these procedural issues cut through the national narrative, members respond with surprise and say; I can’t believe my voters are, are registering this much information on the procedural matters.   But that is what we want. That’s the granularity. That is the moment that you have the ability to let them know that we see precisely what you’re doing. We oppose it, and show them they won’t get away with it.” US Rep Chip Roy echoed these same steps for activists to use. Full show in segments: Bannon hosted a panel discussion that focused on potential issues with electronic voting machines, specifically those from Dominion, and their implications for election integrity. The discussion highlights allegations of altered software, false representation of certification and testing procedures, and the presence of encryption keys that could potentially allow unauthorized access to election data. Attorney Kurt Olsen mentions a legal case in Arizona in which new evidence has been presented, including system log files showing software alterations and the use of uncertified software. The discussion emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues to ensure the integrity of the election process.  Russ Vought discussed a legislative process involving considering a bill related to Ukraine funding and possibly other matters. It seems that there are different perspectives within a political party regarding the handling of the bill, with mention of individuals like Mike Johnson, Hakeem Jeffries, and various members of Congress. There’s discussion about procedural matters, including votes in committees and on the House floor, as well as the involvement of different political factions and the influence of public opinion. The dialogue also touches on broader themes such as U.S. involvement in international affairs, party dynamics, and the role of social media in political advocacy.  Congressman Roy criticized the legislative process and content of a bill related to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, arguing it does not prioritize securing the border and is a capitulation to Democrats. He mentioned the Freedom Caucus’s opposition and former President Trump’s involvement, urging people to contact their representatives and voice their opposition to the bill.  Don Ahern, the owner of Ahern hotel,  expressed gratitude for the attendees’ of the WarRoom event and voiced his support for President Trump. Ahern announces a significant upcoming event where Trump will speak at the hotel, highlighting the removal of a central feature of the hotel to make room for a stage for the Trump event. The event is described as a fundraiser, emphasizing the importance of financial support for Trump’s endeavors. Ahern reminisces about his ties to Nevada and encourages the state to embrace Republican values. Details about the fundraiser are provided, including a text messaging service for updates and the event date. The speaker concludes with enthusiasm for the event’s entertainment and thanks the fellowship of patriots for making America great again.   During a discussion about election integrity and cybersecurity, John Mills shares insights from his recent trip to Taiwan, where he learned about their election procedures. He emphasizes the importance of having insiders or collaborators in addition to technical capabilities for accessing data centers. Mills highlights Taiwan’s simplified election process, which involves paper ballots and minimal computer involvement until the county level. He clarifies that he’s not making accusations but presenting real-world findings and best practices. Mills directs listeners to access more information about his work, including his show, books, and platforms such as Substack, Getter, and Truth. He also offers a discount code for his store.  During an evening broadcast, a private in the Army shares a personal story about being discharged from the military for having a photo of President Trump on his phone. He reveals his journey from Peru to the United States and expresses gratitude to the Republican Party for providing legal assistance to regain his citizenship. Despite facing challenges, including accusations of racism, he remains determined to continue serving his adopted country. The private encourages others to follow him on social media for updates on his situation. The host expresses support and applause for the private’s resilience.  Live audience participation from the Ahern Hotel.  At the Ahern hotel, also called the ” Freedom Hotel”, the CEO of “Repair the Vote” discusses their efforts to pass a constitutional amendment in Nevada requiring voter ID. Despite facing legal challenges from prominent figures like Mark Elias, they continue to collect signatures. Seeking both financial support and volunteers, they emphasize the importance of voter ID, citing widespread bipartisan support. They encourage people to visit their website, www.repairthevote.us, to contribute and get involved, highlighting the potential impact on elections and urging unity in their cause. RepairTheVote.us  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as Steve Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.  </div>
