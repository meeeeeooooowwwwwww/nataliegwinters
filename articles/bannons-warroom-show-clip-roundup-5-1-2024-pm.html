                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5/1/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Cold opens showed footage of crowds cheering for Trump during his Wisconsin speech on Wednesday, and the show ended with footage of President Trump in Michigan at a rally making remarks to an enthusiastic crowd. Highlights: Boris Epshteyn talked about President Trump Ben Bergquam talked about the Fordham University uprising, a Jesuit school where protestors were reported to be in negotiations with school faculty. Erik Prince talked about how the US Congress has allowed intelligence threats to unfold in the United States. Natalie Winters reported on a US House hearing on COVID WarRoom Battleground showed footage of President Trump in Michigan. Reccomended reading: TOO BIG TO WIN Full show in segments: President Trump visits his second rally for the day in Freeland, Michigan, delivers blistering remarks about the lawfare against him, and enjoys the fellowship with his supporters when his trial in New York City takes a break.  Boris Epshteyn updated Steve Bannon about the favorable polling that is being shown on the popularity of President Trump’s candidacy for POTUS, and how he is gaining in likely voters across all demographics, even though the entire Trump campaign has been slowed down with numerous issues of lawfare. Epshyeyn said Trump was in excellent spirits and really enjoyed being out with his supporters and on the campaign trail, as he had a break from court on Wednesday and held two rallies. One rally in Wisconsin and one in Michigan.  Ben Bergquam reported live from Fordham University, where he filmed an uprising of protestors, including students and faculty.  Bergquam attempted to interact with some of the women locking arms, who would only tell him they were protecting the students.  Many students in an administration building appeared to be telling people that they were negotiating with the school administration. Still, then later, there were carloads of what Bergquam reported appeared to be students who had been arrested and taken from the area by police.  Erik Prince talked to Steve Bannon about his extensive understanding of Marxist and Communist movements and tactics. He explained that from his understanding the very dangerous uprisings around college campuses currently unfolding were a result of the Uniparty on DC would not listen to experts about the terrorist inflitartion into American institutions and that they would do anything to stop the funding of these groups so that in essence, it was American lawmakers forcing the American people to pay for our own demise. Mentioned Erik Prince article: TOO BIG TO WIN  Co-host Natalie Winters spoke about her deep and well-researched background as an expert on the activity of Peter Daszak, who appeared at a hearing on the Hill.  Footage shown in the WarRoom was US Rep. James Comer questioning Daszak over being an FBI informant, and Daszak was stalling and not answering the questions. Winters suggested several things she would have asked him about and said that she was hopeful about the hearing due to some crossover from the Democrats, who appeared to be interested in exploring the issues of COVID abuses, saying she looked forward to when Dr. Anthony Fauci would be testifying.   “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.   </div>
