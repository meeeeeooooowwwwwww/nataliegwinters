                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/11/2024 [PM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> November 11, 2024</p>
                <p>Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon laid out a detailed plan for Donald Trump’s potential second term, emphasizing a swift and strategic staffing of key government roles to dismantle the "Deep State.” They criticized open borders, anti-tariff policies, and entrenched politicians who obstructed Trump’s first term. Bannon and Navarro suggested that Trump could use a Senate recess within his first 30 days to make numerous appointments, circumventing bureaucratic delays. They called for an open Senate vote on November 13 to confirm support for Trump-friendly Senate leadership, ensuring cooperation with this plan. Navarro highlighted his article in The Washington Times as a blueprint for Trump’s early-term strategy, which he claimed would allow Trump to make sweeping changes in immigration, energy, and trade policies. Navarro and Bannon urged supporters to demand transparency and accountability from their Senators, framing this as crucial for advancing Trump’s vision. By quickly appointing allies and implementing bold policy reforms, they argue, Trump could counter opposition from establishment Republicans and ensure loyalty within the government.  In this conversation, conservative attorney Mike Davis discusses his call for intense legal scrutiny of figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Special Counsel Jack Smith, who have pursued cases against former President Donald Trump and his allies. Davis expresses a strong desire to hold these figures accountable, suggesting they should undergo rigorous investigations by various government committees and agencies. He asserts that, if they’ve acted lawfully, they should have nothing to fear from such probes. Davis positions his stance as a response to what he sees as political bias and interference by these officials in Trump-related cases, suggesting that their actions represent a coordinated effort by the Biden administration against Trump. Davis also addresses broader issues regarding Senate obstruction during Trump’s term, criticizing Republican senators for not pushing through Trump’s judicial and executive appointments more aggressively. He supports the idea of using recess appointments if necessary, particularly if Democrats attempt to obstruct Trump’s agenda in a potential second term. He notes that forcing Senate members to stay in session rather than allowing long weekends could expedite confirmations.  Steve Bannon talks about President Trump’s cabinet choices so far.   Eric Prince and Steve Bannon engage in a candid discussion on U.S. foreign policy, military spending, and the importance of private sector innovation in government operations. Prince starts by describing his current mission to brief new Republican senators about the global geopolitical situation, emphasizing the need to reduce U.S. military involvement abroad and rely more on private contractors rather than expanding the defense budget. He reflects on the failures of U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, suggesting a leaner, contractor-based approach could have saved resources while stabilizing the country. He criticizes the U.S. military-industrial complex, highlighting the inefficiencies and the high costs of current operations. Drawing on historical examples, he advocates for using contractors to maintain global order at a fraction of the cost of traditional military interventions. Prince also stresses the importance of price discovery and cost transparency in defense spending, citing economist Hayek’s argument that a lack of pricing information leads to inefficient resource allocation. He questions the effectiveness of military strategies, like the U.S. Navy’s current operations in the Red Sea, and stresses the need to rethink traditional approaches to global military presence. The conversation then shifts to the political realm, with Prince offering advice to President Trump’s potential transition team. He underscores the importance of granting recess appointments to bypass bureaucratic delays in staffing the government. He also praises private sector innovation, drawing parallels with Elon Musk’s achievements in space travel, and urges the government to adopt a similar approach to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Bannon expresses support for Prince’s perspective and the importance of streamlining government operations. He mentions a recent political firestorm in the Senate, where some MAGA-aligned senators were voting in ways that didn’t align with their constituents’ expectations. Bannon highlights the need for transparency and public accountability, particularly with regard to Senate leadership votes, and hints at revealing who voted for whom, in line with his broader push for openness and MAGA’s influence in Washington. Part One :  Part Two:  Julie Kelly and Steve Bannon discuss ongoing political issues surrounding the Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI, and the prosecution of individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Kelly highlights growing support on Capitol Hill for investigating the misconduct of special counsel Jack Smith and his team, particularly regarding the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago. She emphasizes the emotional toll the raid had on Melania Trump and calls for a special counsel to investigate it further. Kelly also criticizes the DOJ for its treatment of January 6th defendants, accusing Washington DC judges of bias and mishandling cases. She expresses outrage at the political motivations behind these prosecutions, linking them to broader efforts to punish Trump supporters. Bannon supports Kelly’s views, particularly regarding the need to dismantle the FBI and investigate those responsible for weaponizing the justice system against Trump allies. Both emphasize the need for retribution against those involved in the persecution of January 6th protesters and individuals like Peter Navarro. Kelly also calls for the public to demand accountability, particularly from Republican senators like John Cornyn, whom she accuses of supporting authoritarian tactics. The conversation underscores their belief that revenge and retribution are necessary for the victims of political persecution.  Natalie Winters talked about the most recent battle for the WarRoom over Senate Republicans and the push for transparency about their leadership vote.  Jeff Clark and Steve Bannon discuss the challenges facing conservative leadership within government institutions, emphasizing the deep state’s resistance to strong Republican leadership. Clark points out that much of the career civil service, particularly at the Department of Justice (DOJ), is predominantly Democrat, making it difficult for Republican presidents to implement their agendas. He highlights the importance of having strong, competent individuals in key legal positions to ensure the integrity of the DOJ. Clark also criticizes the weaponization of the National Security Division under the Biden Administration, which he believes has shifted focus from foreign terrorism to targeting domestic political opponents, including conservatives, which he views as unconstitutional and anti-American. Bannon echoes these sentiments, stressing the need for accountability rather than revenge. He critiques the mainstream narrative of unity pushed by the left, arguing that it often seeks to disarm conservatives while failing to hold their own side accountable. Both Clark and Bannon believe that the government has overreached in its efforts to suppress conservative views, citing examples like the FBI’s involvement in monitoring school board meetings. In a broader political context, Clark discusses President Trump’s push for recess appointments, arguing that Senate maneuvers to block such appointments contradict the constitutional framework. He supports Trump’s efforts to assert his mandate and governance powers. Both men emphasize the importance of returning to a constitutional government, with Clark encouraging people to follow his work at the Center for Renewing America.
