                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/7/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Logan Washburn of The Federalist discussed concerns about election misinformation efforts in Michigan, drawing parallels to the 2020 election. He noted that the Center for Tech and Civic Life, linked to Zuckerberg, continues influencing elections, including the 2024 one. In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages citizens to report neighbors for spreading “misinformation,” sparking controversy. The state has established a government email for such reports and launched the “Democracy Ambassadors Program,” ironically promoting neighbor snitching for misinformation in democracy’s name. This approach raises concerns about governmental overreach, potentially suppressing speech by labeling it misinformation. Washburn highlights Attorney General Dana Nessel’s letters threatening legal action against individuals sharing supposed misinformation. One recipient, Carolyn Elic, criticized polling location changes on Facebook and received a legal threat, showcasing the seriousness of these measures. This reflects a broader national trend of combating misinformation, raising questions about free speech and political discourse.  Parker Thayer from Capital Research Center discusses the complex web of dark money influencing left-wing judicial advocacy and political maneuvers. According to Thayer, Demand Justice, a 501(c)(4) dark money group, played a significant role in turning the Supreme Court nomination processes into media circuses, such as during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Thayer states, “Simply because the court has started making rulings that the left does not like, they’re reaching for any weapon they can to attack the Supreme Court.” Demand Justice, originally a project of the 1630 Fund, is linked to Arabella Advisors, a large network directing over a billion dollars annually to leftist causes. Thayer points out the influence of Brian Fallon, former communications director for several high-profile Democrats, who founded Demand Justice and now leads Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. The narrative suggests a strategic manipulation of campaign finance laws, contrasting this with conservative efforts to protect the Supreme Court. While acknowledging some conservative judicial advocacy, Thayer emphasizes the need for continued vigilance against what he perceives as existential threats to the judiciary.  Natalie Winters reacted to a corporate media segment praising Kamala Harris as a Black female boss.  Author Trevor Loudon talked about his past research into the Communist ties of both Kamala Harris and Trevor Loudon.  Mike Lindell talked about his experiences with Democrat Tim Walz. He gave his opinion that Kamala Harris’s choice of him will help President Trump because he is so radical with his policy moves in Minnesota.  Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote praised a recent Georgia election board meeting as a significant step forward for election integrity. Engelbrecht highlighted the bipartisan participation in the meeting, where Republicans and Democrats stood together to address election process concerns. She emphasized the importance of new measures allowing access to ballot images, enabling poll watchers at tabulation centers, and providing election officials with necessary support to ensure transparency. Engelbrecht noted that the citizens of Georgia have been instrumental in pushing for these changes and expressed hope that other states would follow suit. True the Vote is actively working on various initiatives, including verifying voter roll accuracy and conducting voter outreach in long-term care facilities. They aim to engage volunteers nationwide to assist in voter registration and education efforts. Engelbrecht encourages people to get involved through their website, truethevote.org, and participate in training programs to support fair and secure elections.  Liz Harrington emphasized the significance of Georgia’s state election board meeting, where a rule was passed allowing county officials to make reasonable inquiries into election results before certifying them. Despite opposition, this rule prevents undue pressure on officials to certify results without verification. Harrington stressed the need for support from Republican parties for election integrity and accountability.  Maureen Bannon criticized Kamala Harris’s choice of Tim Walz as a VP pick, highlighting Walz’s alleged misconduct. She claimed Walz avoided deployment to Iraq in 2005 by retiring early, leaving his Minnesota National Guard unit without leadership. Bannon also accused Walz of exaggerating his military service, stating he falsely claimed 25 years of service and a higher rank. She argued that his willingness to lie about his service raises questions about his honesty with the American people. Bannon suggested this choice reflects poorly on Democratic strategy, asserting that the MAGA movement should continue to highlight such issues.  Terry Shilling, President of the American Principles Project, criticized Tim Walz for his policies on gender transition for minors, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and abortion. Shilling claims Walz supports radical “child mutilation policies,” allowing minors to undergo “chemical castration” and surgeries for gender transitions. According to Shilling, Walz’s policies enable Minnesota to become a sanctuary for minors seeking gender-affirming care, potentially overriding parental authority. Shilling argues that Walz’s stance on DEI promotes “socialism” and undermines merit-based equality. He criticized Walz’s first executive order as governor to establish a DEI Council, calling it Marxism in disguise. Shilling also targeted Walz’s stance on abortion, alleging that Walz’s legislation allows for abortions up to birth and denying care for babies born during failed abortions. Shilling warns, “If Tim Walz and Kamala Harris become president and vice president, you can expect this not just to stay in the blue states… we will have this going all across the country.”  In discussing his new film, Matthew Taylor highlights its impact by delving into “a very large space of time,” exposing the actions of various political villains, including the intelligence community’s alarming involvement in surveillance activities. Taylor expresses his shock over how “the intelligence apparatus…did the work on behalf of the Clinton campaign,” revealing dangerous misuse of power. Despite these serious revelations, Taylor believes the film offers hope by showing that “they got caught” and were defeated by figures like Kash Patel, emphasizing that government corruption can be overcome. Taylor concludes, “These are very dangerous organizations that have unlimited power…but they can be stopped.” The film is available at warroom.film. </div>
