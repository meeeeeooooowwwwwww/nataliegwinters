                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/6/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris gave her concession speech on Wednesday afternoon. Natalie Winters and Steve Bannon each reacted to the confusing speech.  Natalie Winters discussed the opponents of President Trump, who was declared the winner of the 2024 Presidential elections in the early morning hours of Wednesday. Winters told Steve Bannon that she has seen evidence in public statements that people are devising plans and organizing to fight Trump and his agenda in various ways.  In their discussion, Ret. Lt. Col. Mike Flynn and Steve Bannon outline concerns about anticipated obstacles facing Donald Trump if he returns to office. They describe political opposition as a “battlefield” where Trump’s adversaries will attempt to thwart his agenda from the start. Flynn emphasizes that preparations must begin now, including forming a dedicated team capable of enacting swift reforms and dismantling entrenched structures within government agencies. He suggests immediate personnel changes upon Trump’s hypothetical inauguration, targeting high-level bureaucrats who may obstruct Trump’s policies. Flynn also underscores the importance of Trump’s physical security, advising him to establish a secure base of operations at Mar-a-Lago and rely on specialized military personnel over the Secret Service, whose integrity he questions. Bannon and Flynn propose a bold restructuring of federal agencies and advocate for strong accountability measures. They argue that Trump must enact sweeping policies, including a robust deportation plan, a return to energy independence, and a regulatory rollback to bolster the economy. Both insist that this approach would restore America’s global stature and meet the demands of Trump’s base for accountability, suggesting a potential task force or commission to investigate political adversaries and swiftly address internal corruption. Flynn and Bannon envision Trump’s leadership as essential to reversing what they view as America’s current instability and restoring control domestically and internationally.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon recently discussed concerns over the U.S. economy, with Patrick highlighting the national debt as America’s top security issue, stating, "Debt service payments last fiscal year were 50% above U.S. defense spending.” He explained that high debt levels limit domestic spending and increase dependency on foreign creditors, which he agreed makes the U.S. vulnerable. Patrick also saw recent developments as a rejection of Bidenomics and a vindication of sound fiscal policies, though he acknowledged that Trump would inherit a more challenging economic landscape than in 2016. Turning to financial markets, Patrick and Bannon addressed the recent highs in gold prices. Patrick noted that "central banks have been moving into gold at record levels,” seeing this as a response to U.S. deficit spending and international concerns about dollar stability. He encouraged listeners to consider diversifying into precious metals, suggesting that viewers visit Birch Gold to learn more. Addressing accusations that Bannon aims to destabilize the dollar, he clarified that his “End of the Dollar Empire” series is intended as a "cry for help,” urging policy reforms. Patrick expressed frustration over media misrepresentations and emphasized the series’ intent to highlight economic issues, not advocate the destruction of the dollar.  Natalie Winters talked about the difference between supporters of President Trump and his opponents and said she believed a big difference in the agenda of the two groups was whether or not to put America first in the actions of the Federal government.  In this discussion between Richard Barris and Steve Bannon, the two analyzed the evolving situation in Arizona’s election results, focusing on Carrie Lake’s chances of overcoming her deficit and the broader implications for President Trump’s position. Barris noted that while Lake was trailing by 59,000 votes, there were still a million outstanding votes, primarily from Maricopa County, which tends to report slowly. He emphasized that while Lake could still win without Maricopa, her path to victory depended on gaining significant margins in upcoming ballot dumps. Barris explained that Trump’s lead of nearly 5 points in Arizona would likely help drag Lake across the finish line if the results continued to favor her in key counties. The conversation then shifted to a broader discussion about the strength of Trump’s coalition, which Barris argued was stronger than in previous elections. Trump had managed to expand his support among college-educated whites, working-class voters, and diverse communities, including Black and Hispanic voters. Barris praised the inclusivity of Trump’s coalition, suggesting it resembled a mandate, and pointed to states like New Jersey and New York as areas where the GOP could find future opportunities. He warned against backsliding into establishment politics and urged a continued focus on populist-nationalist policies. Barris concluded by inviting listeners to follow his analysis on Locals. </div>
