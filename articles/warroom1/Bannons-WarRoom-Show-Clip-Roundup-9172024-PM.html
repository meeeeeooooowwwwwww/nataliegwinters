				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> September 17, 2024</p>
                <p>Natalie Winters talks about her anger toward Mike Johnson and the other Republicans who support him, and she decries the use of a Continuing Resolution and called for the WarRoom audience to use BillBlaster and contact their reps with feedback about doing so. Part One:  Part Two:  Darren Beattie critiques the Biden administration and DOJ for weaponizing institutions against political opponents, especially Donald Trump. He calls the timing of recent events, including Merrick Garland’s “rehabilitation tour,” suspicious, particularly in the context of accusations of institutional corruption. Beattie claims this reflects a broader effort to suppress opposition and points to the “Fed’surrection” narrative as a key example. He criticizes media outlets like 60 Minutes for ignoring valid counterpoints, such as those he raised about Ray Epps, which were excluded from a segment attacking him and Tucker Carlson. Beattie argues that the regime manipulates narratives, portraying Capitol Police as victims while ignoring assassination attempts on Trump. He says, “It’s so pathetic… and gives up the game.” He also condemns the handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, highlighting the human toll and claiming the U.S. has squandered nearly $200 billion in support for a corrupt cause. Beattie criticizes Kamala Harris and others for escalating tensions. He believes Trump stands alone in seeking peace, stating, "He’s the only guy who wants it to end,” contrasting him with the "greedy filth running our country.” Beattie urges Trump to continue confronting these corrupt elements until real change occurs.  In a discussion with Jeff Clark and Kingsley Cortes, they highlighted the weaponization of the Department of Justice (DOJ) against figures like Clark. Kingsley explained that their documentary aimed to show how “Jeff’s only crime is supporting President Trump and believing in the Constitution,” while exposing how such beliefs are treated as criminal in today’s political climate. They emphasize the need for accountability, stating, “It’s not retribution or revenge to hold people accountable.” Jeff Clark reflected on his own targeting, attributing it to his desire to investigate the 2020 election: “I didn’t think that I would ever be such a major target.” The conversation also touched on Steve Bannon’s commitment to the movement, as he conducted an interview with them on the day he was set to report to prison, showcasing his dedication to the cause.  Reagan Reese highlighted concerns regarding CBS News’ potential bias as it prepares to host the vice-presidential debate. She noted that CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, have leadership who previously donated to President Biden’s 2020 campaign. Reese pointed out that the CBS president, though she donated while at ABC News, hasn’t done so since. However, she emphasized that this connection could be a point of contention for the Trump campaign, which has a history of criticizing networks for bias. “The Trump campaign really hit CNN and ABC ahead of both debates on their past bias and connections to the Biden campaign,” Reese said. She also referenced the controversy surrounding the ABC debate, where moderators seemed to target Trump while ignoring false claims by Kamala Harris. With the upcoming vice-presidential debate potentially being the last of the 2024 cycle, Reese expects the Trump campaign to challenge CBS’s impartiality.  Jack Posobiec discussed Steve Bannon’s imprisonment, portraying him as a political prisoner fighting the Deep State. Posobiec noted reports from a former inmate stating that Bannon “is praying every day” and attending church regularly while working behind the scenes for a 2024 victory. He emphasized the need for action, stating, “This isn’t about waiting for someone else to come in… We are the ones that ultimately will fall to.” Posobiec then shifted focus to a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, criticizing The New York Times for initially portraying the suspect, Ryan Wesley Rath, as a “Crusader for causes large and small,” which he likened to glorifying the would-be assassin. Posobiec argued that the media is complicit in inciting such attacks, saying, “Positive press coverage has incited…copycat attackers.” He accused the media of misinformation and propaganda, contrasting their treatment of Trump and his supporters with their portrayal of Rath. Posobiec linked the suspect to Ukraine and migrant crime, promoting his book Bulletproof, which details assassination attempts on Trump. Mark Mitchell and Jack Posobiec offer a detailed analysis of the current political climate and polling data, with a focus on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Mark Mitchell discusses the stability of polling data, noting, “We’re the only pollster putting out daily data,” which reveals little change despite various political events. He emphasizes that Trump is showing consistent numbers, with recent polls indicating a tight race. “Trump was up five way back at the end of July,” but the current data shows “Trump plus two.” Mitchell points out that even with significant events, such as the DNC or Trump’s controversial incidents, “nothing’s really changed,” suggesting Trump’s lead remains steady. He highlights that independent voters are crucial and that Pennsylvania will be a key battleground state, noting, “Trump is doing eight points better in our polling than he was four years ago.” Jack Posobiec critiques Axios for promoting the “red mirage” narrative, questioning its validity given the current polling data. He argues, “Republicans overperform when Trump is on the ballot” and suggests that despite various shocks to the system, such as Trump’s controversies, “the numbers haven’t really changed.” Posobiec also points out that Kamala Harris struggles with independent voters, who “hate the Biden regime,” and views Trump as a “fresh start” compared to Harris’s perceived continuity with the current administration. Part One:  Part TWO:  Part THREE:  In their discussion, Jack Posobiec and Sam Faddis analyzed significant security failures surrounding Donald Trump, specifically highlighting two assassination attempts. Faddis, reflecting on his Substack article, emphasized that the U.S. government is making a “conscious affirmative decision” not to provide adequate security for Trump, despite his high-profile threats from groups like Iran’s Quds Force. He criticized the lack of surveillance and preparedness, noting how “one drone with an infrared camera” could have easily detected a would-be sniper waiting for 12 hours. Posobiec and Faddis stressed that the media’s portrayal of such incidents, like Ryan Wesley Rath’s assassination attempt, could incite copycat attacks. Posobiec claimed, “The media is complicit,” pointing out that Rath had been in contact with major outlets before the event. The conversation questioned whether these media contacts had foreknowledge of the attack. Faddis concluded by saying, “No reasonable person would think” the government will provide honest responses to these security concerns, emphasizing the dire implications of inadequate protection.  JacK Posobiec and Cliff Maloney discussed critical insights into Pennsylvania’s electoral landscape. Maloney reported, "We have 120 full-time ballot chasers on the ground in Pennsylvania,” and highlighted a significant drop in Democratic mail-in ballot requests, noting, "Democrats are down 303,000 compared to 2020.” He also observed that "the energy is not there for Kamala,” reflecting a decline in enthusiasm compared to past elections. Posobiec expressed doubts about Kamala Harris’s campaign strategy, stating, "I think she’s going to try all the identity politics she can, but there’s no coalition to put together.” Maloney emphasized the strategic importance of President Trump’s upcoming visit to Southeastern Pennsylvania, asserting, "The event at Our Lady of Chestohova is huge for Polish Americans and will resonate more than any ad Harris might run.” The discussion underscored a strategic push to leverage grassroots efforts and counter Democratic advantages. </p>
