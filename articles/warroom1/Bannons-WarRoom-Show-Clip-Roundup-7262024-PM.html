				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> July 26, 2024</p>
                <p>Representative Bob Good expresses frustration with Congress’s lack of progress on key issues, criticizing House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to send Congress on a District work period in August. Good argues that Congress should have stayed in session to address the nation’s pressing issues and complete the necessary spending bills. He stated, “the point is still well made by the Speaker promised back early in the year that if we didn’t complete our 12 required spending bills, he would cancel the August recess.” Good blames Congress’s inefficiency on a “lack of resolve” and “toughness” within the Republican Party, leading to continuous concessions to the Senate. Good also highlights the need for effective investigations into significant issues, including the Secret Service’s role in alleged election interference, stating, “There would be no basis for confidence based on past history, but we do have the opportunity to be different this time.” He calls for a task force composed of “real Fighters” to ensure accountability. Ultimately, Good questions the Republican Party’s ability to deliver meaningful results for the American people, warning that continued failure may undermine public trust. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters expresses her thoughts and ideas about Congress being on Recess now, saying she is unhappy about that Speaker Johnson didn’t keep his word to hold Congress to address spending bills.  Trevor Loudon, an investigative reporter, highlights Kamala Harris’s alleged connections to radical leftist circles and Chinese communist influence. He points out that Harris’s father was a “bonafide Marxist economist,” and throughout her career, she has been influenced by Marxist circles, including figures like Willie Brown, a long-time Communist Party supporter. Loudon argues that Harris’s rise in politics is supported by Steve Phillips, a Maoist who aims to mobilize minority groups and progressive whites to shift America towards socialism. He emphasizes Harris’s focus on racial politics, noting her support for Black Lives Matter and its alleged ties to Chinese communist organizations. Loudon suggests that Harris is “the most left-wing candidate” and warns of her potential influence on policies, particularly regarding immigration and racial issues. He also claims that Chinese-linked organizations are working to mobilize voters to secure Harris’s political success. Loudon stresses the need for awareness of these influences in American politics. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Miranda Devine’s article for the New York Post exposes significant issues within the FBI, highlighting a lack of confidence from local law enforcement. According to whistleblower reports, local police view the FBI as politically biased and acting as enforcers for the Biden Department of Justice. This mistrust intensified after the FBI’s actions following the January 6th Capitol riot, where non-violent Trump supporters were aggressively pursued. The FBI’s raid on Donald Trump’s residence in Florida further eroded trust, causing local cops nationwide to believe the agency is corrupt. As a result, police are reluctant to share intelligence with the FBI, raising concerns for national security and public safety. The recent assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, exemplifies these issues, showcasing failures in cooperation between the FBI, Secret Service, and local law enforcement. Devine emphasizes that partisan bias and incompetence within these agencies compromise their ability to effectively protect national figures and the public. Part One:  Part Two:  In a recent interview, T.J. Harker emphasized the need to end the Federal Reserve and control fiat currency, aligning with libertarian views. He discussed his article on the “post-constitutional order” in America, which drew criticism from the Cato Institute. Harker questioned whether a constitutional order still exists, suggesting it’s either dead or on life support. He highlighted the misuse of the legal system, known as “lawfare,” where the criminal justice system is weaponized against political opponents. Harker argued that figures like federal prosecutor Jack Smith and district attorneys Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg could be prosecuted under existing laws for their actions against Donald Trump. He suggested that these prosecutions are politically motivated, with broad statutes allowing for the criminalization of legitimate conduct. Harker also speculated on Kamala Harris’s political strategy, given her prosecutorial background. He suggested that she might gain political advantage by dismissing federal cases against Trump, framing it as an effort to unify the country and restore the rule of law. However, he acknowledged that such a move is unlikely. Overall, Harker emphasized the importance of addressing these legal and political issues to maintain a fair constitutional order.  Tim Hinchcliffe discussed the evolving field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and their intersection with globalism and politics. He criticized Yuval Noah Harari and Nina Farahani for their strong but pessimistic views on BCIs, which they argue could have more risks than benefits. Despite their high-profile platforms, like the World Economic Forum, Hinchliffe is skeptical of their motives, suggesting that these figures might warn about and exploit the technology’s potential. Hinchcliffe outlined the current state of BCIs, from non-invasive devices like smart tattoos to invasive technologies such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which aims to restore mobility in disabled patients. He noted that while Harari and Farahani are vocal about the dangers of these technologies, the World Economic Forum seems to balance concern with enthusiasm for their possibilities. He highlighted a shift from the Internet of Things to the Internet of Bodies and, eventually, the Internet of Brains, where BCIs could enable brain-to-brain communication and shared thoughts. Hinchcliffe warned that this could lead to manipulative "memetic warfare,” where narratives shape behavior and policies without relying on concrete data. He urged caution, particularly with right-wing figures involved in transhumanism and their potential influence on policy, given their connections to defense and intelligence agencies. </p>
