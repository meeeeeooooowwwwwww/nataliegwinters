                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/23/2024 [PM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> July 24, 2024</p>
                <p>In a Tuesday WarRoom conversation, Peter Navarro and U.S. Representative Andy Biggs discussed the implementation challenges of the First Step Act of 2018, which aims to reduce recidivism and the federal prison population through earned time credits for inmates. Navarro, who experienced the federal prison system firsthand, criticized the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for failing to implement the act effectively, resulting in delayed releases by six to twelve months. Biggs supported Navarro’s claims, noting that BOP Director Peters acknowledged the backlog affecting approximately 60,000 inmates. Biggs expressed frustration over federal overreach, stating, “There are far too many federal crimes. The founders had it right: criminal law is supposed to be left to the states. Instead, we have over 40,000 federal offenses, leading to absurd imprisonments.” He argued that reducing federal crimes could prevent such issues and highlighted that prisoners compliant with state laws still faced incarceration due to federal violations. Navarro shared a poignant story about an inmate who missed his mother’s passing due to delayed release, emphasizing the human cost of these inefficiencies. Biggs noted that while Peters seemed committed to resolving these issues, the solution involves a comprehensive review of federal crimes and better resource allocation to implement the First Step Act properly. Both emphasized the potential $5 billion in savings and advocated for swift changes to improve the system, suggesting that electronic monitoring and home confinement could reduce costs and facilitate smoother transitions for eligible inmates.  Peter Navarro and Mark Mitchell from Rasmussen discussed recent polling data and their meaning for the upcoming election, focusing on a controversial Reuters poll. Navarro opened the discussion with skepticism, suggesting that the poll was "pure propaganda for the left.” The conversation then dove into the methodology behind the poll, with Mitchell explaining why he believes the data is flawed. He emphasized the importance of polling likely voters rather than just registered voters, stating, "Rasmussen always polls likely voters because we think it’s a better reflection of what happens in November.” He argued that the Reuters poll’s sample of registered voters might not accurately predict election outcomes, especially since the entire industry shifts to likely voters as the election approaches. Mitchell also highlighted the recent Republican National Committee (RNC) event’s impact on polling, noting a significant post-RNC bounce for Donald Trump. He contrasted this with the Reuters poll’s surprising findings, which showed Kamala Harris outperforming Joe Biden against Trump, something Mitchell found inconsistent with previous polling trends. “I’ve polled about Kamala Harris a lot of times, and never once in any one of our polls has Kamala Harris ever outperformed Joe Biden,” Mitchell stated, underscoring his doubts about the poll’s credibility. The discussion also covered key election issues, with Mitchell noting that Republicans have an edge on almost every issue that matters to voters, particularly the economy and border security. Navarro and Mitchell agreed that the Democrats’ focus on "Orange man bad, abortion, abortion, abortion” might not resonate as effectively as the Republican emphasis on policy issues. They concluded that the election might hinge more on policy than personality despite the chaotic political climate.  Natalie Winters discussed Kimberly Cheatle’s resignation on Tuesday and told the WarRoom audience that she hopes criminal changes will follow.  In this segment on War Room, Scott Pressler shared significant political developments in Pennsylvania, highlighting a notable shift from Democratic to Republican control in various counties. Pressler celebrated the successful flip of Bucks County, stating, "We together flipped Bucks County, Pennsylvania from Blue to Red. This is something… a County that four years ago had 15,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans now has a plurality of registered Republicans.” He emphasized the importance of this shift for upcoming elections, asserting, "If we are able to win Bucks County, this November we will win Pennsylvania. And therefore, we will win the White House and we will have saved Western Civilization.” Pressler outlined future goals, mentioning, "We are 1,370 voters away from flipping Luzerne County from Blue to Red” and targeting Erie, Chester, Monroe, and Center Counties. He stressed the need for continued voter registration and turnout efforts, saying, "We must be more diligent, we must work harder than ever to continue registering new voters and to turn out these voters.” Addressing challenges, Pressler expressed frustration with Pennsylvania’s Department of State for not providing transparency regarding voter registration data. He criticized their response to concerns about illegal voting, noting, "The automatic photo registration… they say they have checks and balances to ensure that no illegal aliens are getting registered to vote.” Pressler also cautioned against complacency and urged focus on policy over personal attacks. He advised supporters to concentrate on Kamala Harris’s policies rather than her personal attributes, asserting, "I encourage you to focus on policy. This is a woman that spent her career locking up Americans while allowing illegal aliens to break our laws.” Finally, Pressler appealed for support for his organization, Early Vote Action, to further their voter outreach efforts, saying, "If you want direct face-to-face voter contact… please consider chipping in whatever you can.” Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Congressman Tim Burchett discussed significant developments related to Steve Bannon and broader political concerns. Burchett expressed his frustration with the House’s handling of Bannon’s case, highlighting a bill to invalidate the January 6th committee’s subpoenas. He criticized the committee as “invalid” due to its composition. He suggested that its actions, including Bannon’s wrongful conviction, should be reconsidered: “The subpoenas would be invalid, and then Steve Bannon’s wrongful conviction would be invalid.” Natalie Winters echoed Burchett and also lamented the slow response from House Republicans, questioning why significant actions were delayed until just before Bannon’s surrender. He attributed the delay to a lack of courage among GOP members, asserting: “We don’t have any guts,” and criticized the party’s leadership for not prioritizing Bannon’s case over other issues. Regarding security failures, Burchett strongly disapproved of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle, especially regarding the January 6th incident. He accused Cheadle and her team of negligence, suggesting that their incompetence contributed to the harm that occurred: “Clearly, this reeks, it is awful.” He emphasized the need for immediate and thorough investigations into security lapses. Burchett also warned against relying on ineffective oversight committees, predicting that investigations would ultimately lead to calls for more funding rather than substantive results. He emphasized the necessity of electing strong, principled leaders to address the nation’s issues. He criticized the entrenched, compromised figures in both parties: “We need to put strong leaders in and support them.”  In a this conversation with Natalie Winters, Mike McCormick offered his insights into the current political landscape, particularly regarding Kamala Harris’s potential candidacy. McCormick predicted that Kamala Harris would likely become the Democratic nominee, suggesting that the upcoming Chicago convention would be marked by intense political maneuvering and "Chicago thuggery.” He speculated on the dynamics of the Democat convention, noting that while there had been rumors about Michelle Obama potentially entering the race, he believed this was unlikely due to her past dissatisfaction with her time in the White House. McCormick also delved into the relationships and tensions within the Democratic Party. He pointed out that Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden had a history of regular meetings, which he claimed were part of a deal to position Clinton for the 2016 presidential run. McCormick recounted how Biden was reportedly upset about not being able to run for president earlier, a sentiment reflected in some leaked emails involving Biden and Clinton. He did not shy away from criticism of Biden, calling him both a “quitter” and a “criminal,” and referenced his book, The Case for Impeaching Joe Biden, which details alleged criminal activities involving Biden in Ukraine and other controversies.
