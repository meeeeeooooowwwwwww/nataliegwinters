				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> May 17, 2024</p>
                <p>Cold Open started with Jamie Raskin mocking official proceedings and being a clown, and it opened with footage of Matt Gaez and others in front of the courthouse at a press conference. At the same time, opponents of MAGA screamed and yelled and tried to divert attention from what they were saying about the judge’s conflict of interest. Back into Raskin taunting US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which proceeded into a huge dust-up with AOC having a tantrum. Juxtaposed with the footage from the courthouse.  MSNBC footage showed Rachel Madow in a panic “This is like a tale of two cities, full meltdown. We are hurling toward a Constitutional crisis.  I think it is becoming clear about the Biden tapes, and about Biden’s participation with documents- and that is why Trump’s charges are so strange,” Steve Bannon May 17 (Bob Good Segment). Highlights: Steve Bannon talked about the overall tapestry of politics, with meltdowns, panicked Democrats, and corporate media in a tizzy. US Rep. Bob Good talked about the meltdown in NYC at the courthouse on Thursday and the meltdowns at the Committee to find US AG Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress. Jeff Clark talked to Steve Bannon about his eyewitness account of the trial proceedings on Thursday, including the Thursday press conference at the courthouse. He trashed the media’s coverage of these events, which was brazenly slanted away from what Clark experienced. Ben Harnwell discussed his research into the Ukraine war and a recent New York Times article about NATO. Mike Lindell talked about the changes on the Minnesota flag, including a special deal on sheets and a free flag pillow. Scott Bessent talked about ties Bidden has to China and how to understand his point of view on economics to save the Republic. Josh Hammer talked about his latest op-ed about the lawfare against President Trump. Natalie Winters talked about her latest article about George Soros’s political influence. Aaron Zar talked about the products his company started- faraday bags. Reccomended reading: Wall Street Titans Are Looking for Signs Trump Can Win, Bessent Says- Scott Bessent Segment As Russia Advances, NATO Considers Sending Trainers Into Ukraine- Ben Harnwell Segment Will Democrats Pay a Price for Their Cynical, Crumbling Lawfare Strategy?- Josh Hammer Segment Full show in segments: Thrusday saw a whirlwind of events in both New York City and in congressional committees. Congressman Bob Good led the House Freedom Caucus in a defense of President Trump in front of the nation. Meanwhile, the Oversight and Judiciary Committees delved into a Firestorm regarding Merrick Garland’s contempt of Congress over subpoenaed tapes, with the White House invoking executive privilege. Congressman Good described his experience in New York City court, criticizing what he perceives as a biased prosecution and a witness with personal vendettas against Trump. He sees this as part of a larger effort by Democrats to hinder Trump’s political future, from attempting to keep him off the ballot in 2020 to now potentially imprisoning him. Good emphasized the solidarity of the House Freedom Caucus in supporting Trump and challenging the narrative around his legal battles. Despite facing criticism, he remains committed to defending Trump and confronting what he sees as unfair treatment by the legal system and political opponents.  The recent events surrounding the defense of President Trump in court and the scrutiny over documents related to Biden’s past actions have raised concerns about political bias and potential interference in the upcoming elections. Jeff Clark criticized media portrayal of congressional support for Trump as nefarious, highlighting the predominance of leftist figures in the courtroom. He emphasized the legitimate oversight role of Congress amidst accusations of interference. The focus on Biden’s documents has sparked suspicion, with questions raised about the timing and motivations behind the scrutiny. The debate over executive privilege and access to relevant information further complicates the situation, with concerns about a potential constitutional crisis looming. Clark brought up Robert Hurr and talked about the tapes that he recorded.  Mike Lindell talked about the uprising against Minnesota adopting what he described as an Islamic flag, talking about the process of how the state changed their flag, and why people are upset.  Lindell told Bannon that even Democrats were upset by it so it could be a unifying scandal.  Lindell also talked about special deals he had for the WarRoom audience- low prices on sheets and a free flag pillow.  Josh Hammer talked about his newest article for Newsweek, quesioning if the Democrats obvious lawfare against President Trump had finally been exposed as ridicilious as it seems to Hammer. MENTIONED: Will Democrats Pay a Price for Their Cynical, Crumbling Lawfare Strategy?  Scott Bessent joined the Warroom to talk about the economic conditions that need to be created to pull the US Economy back from the edge of destrucion, saying that it would be difficult to do, but that there were ways to save the American Republic. Bessent is the subject an article that Steve Bannon reccomends the audience read and get familar with, MENTIONED: Wall Street Titans Are Looking for Signs Trump Can Win, Bessent Says  Aaron Zar talked to Steve Bannon about being a member of the Patriot Economy with his products that are Faraday Bags.  His products help block intrusions into people’s privacy from their electronics.  Natalie Winters talked about her latest article for the WarRoom. Mentioned: EXC: Soros-Backed Group Advising Election Offices On Poll Worker Selection.  Ben Harnwell talked to Steve Bannon about his accurate prediction about the escalation of the war in Ukraine- which is now being covered by corporate media.  Reports show that NATO and the Biden administration differ and the problem could deepen concerns over US funding.   This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history.  </p>
