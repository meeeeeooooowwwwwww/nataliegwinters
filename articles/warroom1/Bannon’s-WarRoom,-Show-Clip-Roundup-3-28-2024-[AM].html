                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 3/28/2024 [AM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> March 29, 2024</p>
                <p>Steve Bannon hosted the morning program, and his guests joined in on meaningful conversations. Thursday Morning’s brief:  from March 28, 2024, covers various political discussions between US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), Steve Bannon, and other guests. MTG and Bannon discussed topics such as Larry David’s mockery of Georgia, concerns about election integrity in Georgia, criticism of the Republican establishment, dissatisfaction with Republican leadership in Congress, and calls for accountability and new leadership. There were mentions of impeachment efforts and frustration with Speaker Mike Johnson. Additionally, they discussed President Biden’s perceived connection to former President Obama, the recent government funding bill, and concerns about the treatment of attorney John Eastman. A conversation with Abe Hamadeh highlighted concerns about corruption in Arizona, particularly regarding a defamation lawsuit against Kari Lake. Lake positioned herself as a fighter against corruption, emphasizing the importance of protecting the judicial system. Dr. John Eastman discussed the perceived attack on him for questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election, criticizing the legal process and calling for accountability. Natalie Dominguez shared insights on protecting home titles, promoting HomeTitleLock.com. Lastly, Mike Lindell addressed bankruptcy rumors regarding MyPillow, emphasizing their financial stability and promoting exclusive deals for the War Room audience. Full show in segments: US Rep. Republican Majorie Taylor Greene (MTG) spoke with Steve Bannon about various political topics, including plans for a particular segment to discuss Larry David’s mockery of Georgia, concerns about election integrity in Georgia, criticism of the Republican establishment in the state, dissatisfaction with Republican leadership in Congress, and calls for accountability and new leadership. Thursday’s conversation also addressed specific examples of political maneuvering and betrayals within the Republican Party. Additionally, there are mentions of impeachment efforts and frustration with the current state of affairs under Speaker Mike Johnson. The comments between Bannon and MTG reflect a sense of urgency and dissatisfaction with the status quo, particularly those advocating for conservative principles and pushing back against perceived establishment politics.  Bannon said that the political elites and the media are shaping public opinion and supporting the Biden administration.   Abe Hamadeh appeared to talk to Steve Bannon about Kari Lake’s strategic maneuver in response to a defamation lawsuit brought against her, exploiting the legal system’s weaknesses. Despite the Supreme Court allowing the case to proceed to trial, Lake’s defaulting has caught her opponents off guard. By letting her case go into default and then requesting to see the damages owed for the alleged statement, Lake has shifted the narrative and exposed the lawsuit’s true intentions, which she claims are politically motivated. The following conversation highlights the legal system’s perceived bias and manipulation, prompting Hamadeh to call for investigation and accountability. Concerns about compromised elections and weaponized legal processes are raised, with Lake positioning herself as a fighter against corruption by Bannon.  Steve Bannon joined John Eastman to discuss Eastman’s recent disbarment recommendation and the perceived injustices in the legal process. Eastman alleges that the recommendation is filled with lies and misrepresentations, vowing to vigorously challenge it up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The conversation delves into the details of the legal proceedings, including claims of blocked witnesses and evidence. Eastman accuses the judge of bias and asserts his right to advocate for his client, arguing that reasonable legal theories were dismissed unfairly. The conversation touches on broader themes of government authority and the erosion of democratic principles, drawing parallels to historical authoritarian regimes. There’s criticism of Attorney General Bill Barr’s handling of voter fraud allegations and a call for accountability. The discussion concludes with a commitment to continue the fight against perceived injustices.  Natalie Dominguez, an education specialist on theft protection, shared a success story with Steve Bannon, highlighting the importance of safeguarding home titles. In the example Dominguez gave for how necessary these actions are,  she told Bannon about a family from Florida, who faced potential property loss due to fraudulent activity. Fortunately, they were subscribed to Home Title Lock, which alerted them to the suspicious activity and provided expert assistance in rectifying the situation. This underscores the significance of protecting home equity, which is often a homeowner’s most valuable asset. To ensure protection against such threats, viewers are encouraged to visit hometitlelock.com and utilize the promo code “war room” for a free 30-day trial and a complimentary title scan history. This proactive measure can prevent costly and time-consuming legal battles associated with title theft. Steve Bannon emphasized the importance of such protection, and Natalie Dominguez will become a regular contributor to share more insights on the matter.  In this segment, Republican Kari Lake, who is running for the US Senate from Arizona, expressed her determination to fight against what she says is fake news that she said attempts to delegitimize the electoral process.  Lake accuses her opponents of attempting to distract her from the campaign trail through legal battles and asserts her belief in her victory in the 2022 midterm elections. She discusses a defamation lawsuit filed against her and claims it is politically motivated to undermine her candidacy. Lake emphasizes the importance of her Senate race in Arizona and accuses her opponent of being radical and supported by influential figures. She invites support for her campaign and stresses the significance of protecting the judicial system. Overall, Lake is a staunch defender of truth and the American values she believes in.  Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, addressed bankruptcy rumors, clarifying that it’s regurgitated news from last year when they moved out of a warehouse in Minnesota. He explains that his company sub-rented the warehouse to a candy company, which later backed out, leaving it empty. Lindell assures that this situation does not indicate bankruptcy and emphasizes that they are not going anywhere. He then promotes exclusive deals for the War Room audience on My Pillow products, including robes, towels, pillows, and sandals. Lindell concludes by thanking the audience and promoting the website and phone number for ordering.  </p>
