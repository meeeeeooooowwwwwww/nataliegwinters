                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/16/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts about the assassination attempts on President Trump.  Eric Prince raised concerns about the federal government and law enforcement’s handling of political violence and threats, particularly against Donald Trump. He criticized the FBI, referencing their actions in Florida and the raid on Mar-a-Lago, questioning their ability to seek truth. Prince emphasized that Florida should lead investigations due to the federal government’s lack of credibility. He also described an attempted assassination on Trump by an individual who was seeking recognition as a left-wing hero. Prince highlighted the need for more robust security measures, suggesting that private sector and special operations forces could be used to protect Trump by anticipating potential threats. He stressed that maintaining the safety of presidential candidates is crucial for national security and election integrity, expressing gratitude for Trump’s survival while calling for the left to denounce violence.  Mike Benz criticized the official narrative about Ryan Ruth, dismissing it as nonsense. He claims Ruth was heavily involved in recruiting foreign fighters, particularly from regions like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, to join the Ukrainian conflict. Benz highlighted Ruth’s role in collecting passports from terrorists and securing visas for them to enter Ukraine, bypassing local embassies. He drew parallels to a previous “visas for terrorists” operation detailed by Michael Springman, a former State Department official, which involved the CIA facilitating visas for the 9/11 hijackers. Benz argues that Ruth’s actions reflect a continuation of similar covert operations, implicating U.S. intelligence agencies.  Matt Boyle from Breitbart discussed the recent assassination attempts on former President Trump, highlighting severe security lapses within the U.S. Secret Service. Over two months, two individuals exploited weaknesses in Trump’s security detail, with one attacker successfully firing shots, wounding Trump and killing a person. In the second incident, a Secret Service agent intercepted a gunman near Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course. Boyle questioned how attackers pinpointed Trump’s location, given the non-public nature of his schedule, speculating potential insider involvement from Trump’s campaign, the FBI, or Homeland Security. Boyle further criticized the lack of transparency from federal agencies and praised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for initiating a state investigation. The rhetoric of left-wing media was also scrutinized, linking the shooter’s radicalization to his consumption of mainstream media and engagement with political figures. Boyle raised concerns about FBI bias, urging congressional action to ensure the safety of Trump and his family.  Luke Mahoney, Matt Boyle, and Alex DeGrasse expressed serious concerns over intelligence warnings of foreign adversaries targeting former President Trump and Senator JD Vance, highlighting unprecedented threats to their security. Mahoney noted the lack of transparency from federal agencies, especially regarding the FBI’s withholding of key information about recent assassination attempts. Boyle criticized the media for radicalizing individuals through inflammatory narratives, pointing out the suspect’s extreme views fueled by left-wing rhetoric. DeGrasse stressed the need for urgent congressional action and a deeper investigation into how assailants could track Trump’s movements. He also raised concerns about potential federal involvement in the assailants’ activities. All three called for greater accountability from federal agencies, stronger security measures, and more aggressive action from Congress to protect Trump, noting that drastic times require drastic measures. They also discussed the shifting voter registration landscape in Pennsylvania, with Republicans gaining ground on Democrats, which could impact future elections. Part ONE: Part TWO:   Alex DeGrasse’s comments emphasize the importance of vigilance in political campaigns. He highlights a scheme by a secretive group that allegedly recruited far-right candidates to pull votes from Republicans in battleground races. DeGrasse warns that Democratic operatives may infiltrate online discussions to manipulate GOP efforts, stressing the need for caution when engaging with unfamiliar individuals. He also discusses how early voting can play a decisive role in securing election victories, particularly in key states like Pennsylvania. He calls on Trump supporters to become poll watchers and ensure that ballots are properly counted. Additionally, DeGrasse underscores the need to target specific districts, mobilize voters, and raise financial support to ensure a robust early voting effort. The ultimate goal is to secure enough votes to avoid potential election day challenges and ensure Republican victories in crucial races.  Alex DeGrasse and Luke Mahoney emphasize the urgency of grassroots involvement in the final stretch before the election. They stress the need for “ramparts action” — working phone lines, canvassing, and recruiting poll watchers to ensure election integrity. A particular focus is on securing early votes in battleground states like Pennsylvania. They highlight a recent revelation of Democrats recruiting far-right candidates to siphon votes from Republicans, underscoring the importance of vigilance in online interactions and campaign operations. DeGrasse warns of potential efforts to undermine GOP campaigns, while Mahoney calls for early voting to mitigate election day risks. Their message is clear: grassroots mobilization, securing early votes, and vigilance are key to winning the election.  Alex DeGrasse stresses the importance of early voting in battleground states like Pennsylvania, where securing early votes can create a critical lead before election day. He emphasizes that visible support for Trump through signs and flags is a mental validation for the movement’s strength. DeGrasse calls for voters to engage by ensuring three people they know vote early. He highlights three crucial House races in Pennsylvania that could influence Trump’s victory and warns that Democrats may attempt to overturn the election results using the 14th Amendment. DeGrasse concludes with a call for grassroots action, donations, and vigilance.   </div>
