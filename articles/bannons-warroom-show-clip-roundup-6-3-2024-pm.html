                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 6/3/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Mike Howell expressed strong criticism over the lack of effective action by Jim Jordan and others in Congress regarding defunding the DOJ, special counsel, and FBI. He described the efforts over the past year and a half as ineffective “Pen Pal games” with no real consequences for non-compliance by the current administration. Howell argued that merely talking about defunding at this late stage is absurd, given that significant concessions have already been made to President Biden. He suggested that Congress should appoint a legislative special counsel with substantial funding to take decisive action. Howell emphasized that the current measures, such as returning funds instead of utilizing them for investigations, are inadequate. He cited notable conservative legal figures advocating for more aggressive investigations into Democratic actions and criticized the lack of substantial responses to perceived abuses by the administration, including issues related to immigration and alleged political weaponization of institutions.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the significance and implications of a recent hearing featuring Dr. Anthony Fauci. They criticized the effectiveness of the hearing, suggesting it failed to adequately address key issues regarding the origins of COVID-19 and the involvement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Winters pointed out that many admissions made by Fauci, such as the arbitrary creation of the six-foot social distancing rule and the questionable efficacy and safety of vaccines, have long been suspected. Winters emphasized that despite bipartisan efforts, the hearing did not sufficiently expose deeper issues within the NIH or hold Fauci accountable. She argued that the pandemic was not due to incompetence but intentional actions, particularly by the Chinese Communist Party, and suggested that the NIH and Fauci were complicit. Bannon and Winters noted that the Democrats used the hearing to push for more pandemic prevention funding and mRNA vaccine development. At the same time, Republicans seemed more focused on creating viral moments rather than achieving substantive results. They also criticized establishment Republicans for not taking strong actions against China and for potentially using the hearing to protect Fauci and the status quo. Winters argued that the committee might be part of a cover-up operation, serving the establishment’s interests by using Peter Daszak as a scapegoat. Both Bannon and Winters expressed frustration with the hearing, seeing it as an insult to the intelligence of the American people and a missed opportunity to hold key figures accountable.  Steve Bannon and Dr. Bradley Thayer discussed the significance of the Tiananmen Square massacre and its broader implications. Thayer provided a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the massacre, emphasizing the brutal suppression of a pro-democracy movement by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He highlighted the CCP’s long history of suppressing dissent and the use of advanced technology to maintain control over the Chinese population. Thayer outlined several key lessons from the massacre, including the CCP’s willingness to use extreme measures to stay in power, the importance of democracy as an alternative to authoritarian rule, and the role of advanced technology in facilitating government control. He stressed the need for solidarity with the Chinese people in their struggle against CCP oppression. Bannon and Thayer expressed their commitment to commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and to raising awareness about the ongoing crisis in Taiwan. They also discussed upcoming discussions on related topics, such as the European parliamentary election and cybersecurity issues. Overall, the conversation underscored the continued relevance of Tiananmen Square as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and the importance of supporting democratic movements in China.  There’s confusion surrounding Biden’s approach to the Israel-Gaza conflict. While he’s been steadfast in other conflicts like Ukraine, calling for “as long as it takes,” he’s now pushing for an immediate end to the Israel-Gaza conflict, prompting questions about his motives. Hazony points out Biden’s three-stage plan, which lacks an aim to dismantle Hamas, the group behind the conflict. There’s concern that Biden’s rush for a ceasefire may stem from political expediency rather than strategic considerations. Additionally, there’s speculation about the stability of Netanyahu’s government amidst the crisis and potential implications for Israeli politics. Ultimately, Hazony warns of a misguided approach that may undermine long-term peace and stability in the region.  Raheem Kassam and Steve Bannon discussed the recent anti-Sharia protest in the UK, which Nigel Farage may view as a call for a more politically organized movement rather than just protests. They also highlighted the media’s suppression of incidents like the recent stabbing of a German police officer by a migrant, underscoring a pattern of normalization of such crimes by the political and media establishment. They emphasized the importance of outlets like the National Pulse for independent reporting and urged people to visit their website for truthful coverage.  Ben Harnwell and Steve Bannon discussed the UK’s Conservative Party’s complacency, highlighting its lack of genuine conservative values and the need for an alternative. They emphasized the urgency of dismantling the Tory party, which they perceived as co-opted by globalists. Transitioning to a discussion about America’s role in the global order, they explored why the prospect of a transactional approach under President Trump unnerves European elites. Bannon argued that America, once a beacon of liberty, has been compromised by its political class and now serves as a linchpin for the globalist order. They also touched upon the upcoming European parliamentary elections’ significance and coverage plans. </div>
