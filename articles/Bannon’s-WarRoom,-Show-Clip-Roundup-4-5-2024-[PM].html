                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/5/2024 [PM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 6, 2024</p>
                <p>Natalie Winters hosted the Friday evening WarRoom show and Steve Bannon hosted the Friday evening WarRoom Battleground program. Highlights:  Full show in segments: Natalie Winters and Kash Patel discussed various topics, including the Biden administration’s regulatory actions and the Pentagon’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Patel, known for his work with the Trump administration, highlighted the hypocrisy in the government’s treatment of regulations and accountability. The conversation also touched on the media’s role in covering up mistakes and the disappointment expressed towards figures like The Rock for their silence on political matters. Patel emphasized the importance of transparency and urged readers to get his book, “Government Gangsters,” which he claims is a roadmap for challenging the Deep State. He also announced an upcoming film adaptation of the book that will be out in May 2024. The discussion concluded with a call to action for readers to spread awareness and educate others about combating government corruption.  This segment of War Room featured Kristan Hawkins discussing recent developments in Florida regarding abortion legislation. Hawkins told Winters that the Florida Supreme Court upheld a late-term abortion limit, preventing abortions after 15 weeks, which is expected to save thousands of lives. However, the court also allowed a late-term abortion ballot referendum to proceed to voters in November despite Governor Santos predicting its failure. Hawkins provided context on Students for Life America’s activism, including protests against Vice President Harris’s abortion policies. Hawkins shared a disturbing incident where protesters threatened and verbally attacked Students for Life members, highlighting the abuse faced by pro-life advocates. The segment concluded with a preview of a video showing the confrontation and a discussion on the extremism of the Democratic Party regarding abortion.  The following discussion on War Room featured Todd Bensman reporting from Mexico on the ongoing border crisis. Bensman highlighted the chaos and contradictions at the border, where immigrants cut through razor wire infrastructure erected by Texas authorities while border patrol stands ready to welcome them into the country. He described scenes of lawlessness and the futility of attempts to secure the border. Bensman also mentioned the Mexican authorities’ efforts to mitigate the crisis’s optics. Meanwhile, on the other side, the La Linea cartel controls the flow of runners and escapees. Bensman emphasized the relentless work of welders repairing holes in the border wall, with criminal elements driving migrants to risk crossing through dangerous routes. The segment concluded as Bensman described the constant struggle to keep up with repairs, highlighting the entrenched nature of the crisis.  In this segment, Dave Brat and Steve Bannon discuss the disconnect between the data presented by the media and the reality experienced by Americans. Brat highlights the populace’s frustration regarding the economy and the negative sentiment towards Bidenomics despite attempts to spin positive narratives. He references polls showing dissatisfaction with the national economy and the impact of inflation on purchasing power. The speakers emphasize the importance of focusing on the real economy rather than stock market fluctuations or minor interest rate changes. They express concerns about the country’s trajectory, suggesting it indicates late-stage capitalism and the rise of techno feudalism.  In this segment, author Jacqueline Toboroff talked to Natalie Winters about the deteriorating situation in New York City, particularly concerning safety issues on the subway and the rise in crime. Toboroff, a concerned mother and resident of NYC, expressed her fear and frustration about the current state of affairs, highlighting the dangers posed by junkies, mentally unstable individuals, criminals, and illegal immigrants. Despite the governor’s performative deployment of the National Guard, Toboroff reported that there seems to be a lack of meaningful efforts to address the problem.   She criticized the rhetoric of certain officials who downplay the severity of the situation and prioritize criminals’ rights over victims’ safety. She emphasized that the consequences of these policies extend beyond New York City and urged people in other areas to be vigilant.  EJ Antoni talked to Steve Bannon and  raised concerns about the latest jobs report, emphasizing the troubling trend of native-born Americans losing jobs while foreign-born workers, including potential illegal immigrants, are gaining employment. Antoni highlights the lack of transparency regarding how many of these foreign-born workers are undocumented and questions the impact of Biden’s immigration policies on job growth statistics. Additionally, there is criticism regarding the quality of jobs being created, focusing on the decrease in full-time employment. Overall, the segment raises questions about the accuracy and implications of current job market trends  In this segment, the discussion revolves around a recently passed 7.2 trillion spending bill in the U.S. House, which includes a two trillion dollar deficit. The guest, Ben Harwell, highlights the intentions behind certain initiatives, particularly regarding funding for Ukraine. He suggests that there may be attempts to spin the narrative to portray support for Ukraine as aligned with Donald Trump’s policies. However, Harwell argues that this is misleading, as there is resistance within the MAGA movement to allocate any additional funds to Ukraine. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the political dynamics at play and urges viewers to be vigilant in selecting their elected representatives. Overall, the segment delves into the complexities of political messaging and the potential implications of legislative decisions.  This segment’s conversation centers around recent legal developments, particularly regarding motions made in the context of ongoing legal proceedings. The guest, Kane from the Citizen Free Press, discusses how the media and the public have interpreted Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s rulings on these motions. He highlights the insights provided by Julie Kelly, a respected figure in the field, and emphasizes the significance of understanding the nuances of legal proceedings. Kane suggests that Judge Jackson’s decisions may have implications that are not immediately apparent and underscores the importance of following reliable sources for accurate analysis. Additionally, the conversation touches on broader political issues such as immigration policy and its potential impact on electoral dynamics.  </p>
