                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/1/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Natalie Winters talked about her opinion of the government and her continued themes of why she dislikes Republicans and the GOP.  Derrek Harvey critiques U.S. and Israeli military strategy in responding to attacks from Iran. He acknowledges that the IDF, supported by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, managed to intercept some of the nearly 200 missiles, but he warns that “the strategy of just absorbing attacks from Iran is not going to succeed.” Harvey argues that Iran is willing to sacrifice Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank in its efforts to destroy Israel. He advocates for a direct response, stating, “The only response is going to have to be…damaging their economy,” by targeting Iran’s oil and gas capabilities and military assets. Additionally, Harvey suggests the U.S. should focus on non-combatant evacuations, protecting embassies, and responding decisively if attacked. He criticizes the Biden administration, saying, “We do not understand deterrence” and “winning wars matters because it sets the conditions for peace.”  Mark Mitchell criticizes mainstream media, particularly MSNBC, for dividing America by pushing false narratives. He highlights that “66% of voters are concerned that the outcome of this election will be affected by cheating,” dismissing claims of the “big lie.” Mitchell rebuffs accusations that his polling is right-leaning, stating that even “The New York Times is to the right of us.” He claims media pollsters consistently use tactics like oversampling Democrats, particularly with Kamala Harris, and presents his own firm as unbiased, noting, “Every time anyone gives us a dime, we declare our sponsorship.” Mitchell predicts that Kamala Harris is losing critical swing states like Michigan and faces further challenges, such as supply chain shortages, rising prices, and potential war in the Middle East. He believes this bodes well for Donald Trump, adding, “Trump’s going to outperform the polling.” He emphasizes that these issues could lead to a shift in support away from Harris, as political narratives evolve closer to Election Day.  Mike Benz argues that censorship using AI, particularly regarding public health issues, is not a future threat but something that has already been happening for years. He explains that “AI keywords” have been used to censor online discussions, particularly during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Benz highlights the involvement of figures like Bill Gates, who is a co-investor in U.S. State Department and military endeavors, and claims that Gates benefits from taxpayer-funded efforts to protect his reputation online against conspiracy theories. He explains that a Pentagon contractor, Graphika, received $7 million to use AI to scan conversations in NATO countries and suppress content critical of Gates. This, according to Benz, violates the First Amendment as public health crises are used as “a humanitarian intervention excuse” to justify military and intelligence involvement. He emphasizes that this censorship, designed to protect Gates’ financial empire, is an ongoing reality rather than a hypothetical concern.  In their discussion, Mike Davis and Mark Paoletta highlight the weaponization of law enforcement, drawing parallels between past and present political battles. Davis introduces Paoletta, praising his crucial role in Supreme Court confirmations, especially for Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas. Paoletta recounts his experience during Thomas’s confirmation, emphasizing the left’s viciousness and their attempts to “destroy” Thomas, not just defeat him. He recalls the intense opposition Thomas faced for being a “black man who thinks on his own,” which Paoletta sees as the left’s cardinal sin. Paoletta also reflects on his work defending Thomas and describes how these experiences shaped his understanding of political weaponization. They compare this to the current attacks on Donald Trump, with Davis noting that Trump has been indicted multiple times and faced attempts to remove him from ballots. Davis and Paoletta argue that Trump is facing the same kind of lawfare they saw used against Thomas and other conservative figures. Looking ahead to a potential second Trump administration, Paoletta outlines the need for accountability. He advocates for firing FBI Director Christopher Wray and Special Counsel Jack Smith, dissolving the January 6 unit, and reviewing the prosecutions related to January 6. Paoletta stresses that these steps are crucial to prevent the left’s use of law enforcement to interfere in future elections. Part One:  Part Two:  In a conversation on election integrity, Mike Davis, Cleta Mitchell, and Mark Lucas addressed concerns about non-citizen voting and the challenges posed in swing states like Arizona, Virginia, and Georgia. Mitchell highlighted a report from Arizona, where 218,000 registered voters failed to provide proof of citizenship, a significant increase from the previously identified 98,000. She mentioned officials downplaying the issue, stating, “It’s just a glitch, but it’s a big problem.” In Virginia, a citizens’ group found around 1,000 votes cast by non-citizens, which Mitchell emphasized as a growing issue across the country, noting, “This is their new political majority for the Democrats.” Davis discussed the Article 3 Project’s efforts to push the Save Act, which targets illegal voting, and their campaign to raise awareness. In Georgia, Lucas discussed ongoing legal challenges regarding election machines and board oversight, with Davis emphasizing the tension between state election boards and progressive opposition, stating, “The whole establishment media is howling.” Part One:  Part Two: </div>
