                	<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/25/2024 [AM]</h1>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 25, 2024</p>
                <p>There are no cold openings for today. Host Steve Bannon jumped right into the news.  Julie Kelly opened the WarRoom action by discussing a US Supreme Court case she would follow and tweet live about it. Bannon moved into interviews from the SCOTUS building and then lived in NYC. “Trump resonates with the working class, he says what we want to hear,” the leader of local 638 told David Zere Thursday morning in NYC. “They were cheering for Trump at the top of their lungs, and it was not staged,” Zere told Bannon. Highlights: Steve Bannon continued to slam the Republican leadership, focusing on Speaker Mike Johnson, saying GOP leadership in DC does not want President Trump to win. Julie Kelly spoke about her coverage of the US SCOTUS case. Mike Davis reported live from the US Supreme Court case dealing with presidential immunity. David Zere was seen reporting live at a rally by NYC construction workers for President Trump from 6 AM Thursday morning before Trump’s court appearances. Zere talked about bringing manufacturing back to the United States. Abe Hamadeh talked about his race for AG in AZ, and details about Trump EJ Antonni talked about the financial situation with new economic reports. Raheem Kassam talked about his new piece in National Pulse about Speaker Mike Johnson. Ben Bergquam reported live from the courthouse in New York City on the ‘hush money’ trial gave details about gag order violations and talked about AZ indictments that were made public Wednesday. Jack Ryan author Steve Stern talked about the Precinct project and a 3:00 call to action Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock Reccomended reading: Statement by Abe Hamadeh about AZ AG KASSAM: What the F–k is Mike Johnson Doing? Reccomended watching: Precinct project call Full show in segments: Julie Kelly will be live tweeting about the historic oral arguments regarding presidential immunity in the case Donald J. Trump versus the U. The case relates to indictments stemming from the events of January 6th and the 2020 election. Lower courts have ruled that presidents are not protected by immunity. Julie’s Twitter handle is @Julie_Kelly2 for real-time commentary. The proceedings are available on C-SPAN and the Supreme Court website. The discussion also briefly touches on Jack Smith’s involvement in a Florida situation, but details are limited.  Abe Hamadeh discusses ongoing legal battles in Arizona, where the AG just handed out felony charges to supporters of President Trump. He highlights his own experience as the legitimate Attorney General candidate, who lost by a mere 208 votes. He points out discrepancies in ballot counts, with what he says are 9,000 outstanding ballots, and alleges a broader criminal conspiracy targeting MAGA candidates and supporters. Hamadeh criticizes the legal system’s handling of cases and expresses frustration with Republican inaction. He emphasizes the importance of fighting for the America First movement and urges support for President Trump. Hamadeh’s website is abeforaz.com for more information.  EJ Antoni discusses the economic landscape, pointing out the discrepancy between GDP growth and increasing debt. He highlights the government’s reliance on deficit spending to boost economic numbers, artificially leading to structural stagflation. He emphasizes the importance of understanding these economic realities and advocates for a change in approach from Washington, DC.  David Zere reported live from New York City on President Trump’s surprise visit to New York, which received praise from construction workers’ unions, showcasing his support among the working class. The event was organized by Gavin Wax and the New York Young Republicans Club. Zere reported that workers expressed frustration with the current administration’s policies and showed enthusiasm for Trump’s promises to bring back manufacturing and protect industries like steel. Despite the organic support, the event contrasted with the ongoing political persecution against Trump. The absence of certain Republican leaders, such as  Speaker Mike Johnson, highlights a divide within the party regarding Trump’s role and the direction of the GOP.   Raheem Kassam and Steve Bannon discuss Mike Johnson’s actions regarding the speaker of the house and their disappointment in his lack of action on key issues. Kassam highlights the importance of focusing on critical issues such as immigration and illegal migration instead of diverting attention to less significant matters, which is what Speaker Johnson is seen as doing. Kassam emphasizes the need for Republican leadership to stop interfering and instead focus on important issues facing the country. He encourages listeners to visit The National Pulse website for more analysis and updates, including one article that caught Bannon’s eye and is on the recommended reading list. KASSAM: What the F–k is Mike Johnson Doing?  Mike Davis reports from outside the Supreme Court on a historic case regarding whether the president of the United States is immune from criminal prosecution for his official acts. He highlights the case’s potential implications and argues that granting immunity to presidents is essential to preserve the integrity of the presidency and the country. T he government’s central argument against immunity is based on the absence of explicit provisions in the Constitution or statutes. However, Davis emphasizes the importance of maintaining separation of powers and warns against the consequences of allowing a president to indict his predecessor for official acts. Later, he discusses the lack of action by the House on criminal conspiracy issues, especially in light of recent events in Arizona. Despite facing protests, Davis underscores the importance of upholding First Amendment rights while reporting on such cases.  Ben Bergquam reported live from New York City that President Trump has been in court, facing efforts to impose violations of a gag order on him. The prosecution is irritated by Trump’s disregard for their rules, particularly regarding mentions of David Pecker, which they see as a breach. However, the charges are viewed by some as a distraction from the real issues the prosecution wants, such as election fraud, which comes at the same time AZ Attorney General is making a big splash and bringing indictments against Trump’s supporters. in Arizona, there are concerns about a conspiracy involving 17 indictments, which some attribute to leftist tactics to manipulate the justice system rather than winning through conventional means. These actions highlight the ongoing battle over the integrity of elections and the role of the courts in deciding political outcomes and adds more suspicion of the need for a criminal conspiracy inquiry from the Republican led US House of Reps..  Steve Stern reported some successes with the Precinct Project. He added that Today at 3:30, there’s a crucial call happening, and Bannon emphasizes its importance, urging people not to “lean on their shovels but to join in”. The call will feature prominent figures like Christina Bob, Greg Stenson, Dr. Naomi Wolf, among others. Stern said they will discuss various topics, including removing illegal voters from state voting rolls and the differences between the timing in voting. Stern provides multiple ways to access the call, emphasizing action and participation.  Natalie Demente discusses the rising ease with which criminals can commit property fraud, highlighting the vulnerabilities in the system. County clerks often cannot detect fraud when processing property transfer documents, leading to potentially fraudulent transactions being accepted. Even if fraud is suspected, clerks are legally obligated to accept the documents. Resolving the issue often requires costly litigation if a fraudulent document is filed for someone’s property. Natalie emphasizes the importance of Home Title Lock in providing comprehensive protection against property fraud. Home Title Lock monitors property changes and intervenes to rectify fraud, giving homeowners peace of mind. She encourages listeners to visit hometitlelock.com and use the promo code “war room” to receive the first 30 days of protection for free, along with a complementary title scan to ensure their property’s security.  Jack Ryan discusses the concept of home ownership from an economic perspective, arguing against the traditional notion of it being a fundamental aspect of the American dream. He challenges the idea that owning a home is always the best financial decision, emphasizing the costs and limitations associated with homeownership, including transaction fees, maintenance expenses, and the lack of mobility it imposes. Ryan suggests that the push for homeownership is perpetuated by real estate cartels and politicians to control individuals’ behavior and tax them more easily. He advocates for a more objective analysis of the financial implications of homeownership. He emphasizes the importance of individuals having a stake in their communities through civic engagement rather than through property ownership. Ryan also discusses his company’s efforts to disrupt the real estate industry by reducing transaction fees and increasing transparency.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history. </p>
