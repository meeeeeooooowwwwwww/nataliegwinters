<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/4/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> October 7, 2024</p>
<p>Steve Kenny, Senior Litigation Counsel at the Republican National Committee (RNC), is central to defending and challenging election laws. Davis notes that Kenny has been pivotal in legal victories, describing him as “the secret weapon” behind Senate Judiciary Committee successes in confirming President Trump’s judges during Davis’ tenure as Chief Counsel. Kenny explains that the RNC is engaged in “the most active litigation docket of any cycle in history,” handling 126 cases across 26 states. Their efforts focus on two main strategies: defending existing election laws from left-wing challenges and proactively filing lawsuits when state officials violate election laws. This shift toward proactive litigation is largely due to the leadership of President Trump and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley. Kenny emphasizes that many Democratic officials refuse to defend election integrity laws, leaving the RNC to step in. He also highlights successes in states like Pennsylvania, where the RNC has defended the requirement for absentee ballots to be signed and dated, calling it a critical tool in preventing voter fraud. He mentions a case where a fraudulent ballot from a deceased voter was detected due to the date requirement, explaining, “It performs a very important voter integrity function.” Election Integrity Battles in Swing States:
Kenny provides updates on key swing states: Pennsylvania: The RNC successfully defended the ballot dating requirement multiple times, and Kenny expects the issue to resurface in upcoming litigation. Michigan: The RNC won against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s attempts to introduce secret instructions that would presume the validity of absentee ballot signatures. Kenny says, “This violates the Michigan Constitution, which requires neutral verification.” Wisconsin: The RNC challenged a policy allowing voters to re-vote by spoiling absentee ballots. They also won lawsuits ensuring Republican representation in nursing homes and poll watcher access. North Carolina: Recent victories include blocking digital student IDs as valid voter IDs and challenging overseas voter regulations that allow individuals who never lived in the state to vote. Georgia: The state has seen the RNC defend several provisions of Senate Bill 202, an election integrity law passed after the 2020 election. Kenny notes, “Nearly all of that law will be in effect for this November.” Arizona: The RNC successfully defended citizenship verification requirements and continues to fight for documentary proof of citizenship in voter registrations. Kenny believes many of these cases will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. Kenny concludes by outlining ongoing legal battles in Nevada, emphasizing that these efforts aim to secure fair elections and ensure that election integrity laws are upheld across the nation.  Maureen Bannon talked about the various voter registration deadlines in various states, and also about the Get Out The Vote Efforts that are necessary to win the ground game for President Trump.  In a discussion between Mike Davis and Mark Lucas from the Article 3 Project, the conversation focuses on preventing non-citizens from voting in key battleground states ahead of the 2024 election. Lucas emphasized that non-citizen voting is a central tactic the left may employ, with Elon Musk highlighting the rising number of illegal migrants. He encouraged War Room listeners to take action through A3P’s website by contacting election officials responsible for verifying citizenship. Lucas pointed out Arizona, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as critical states, with issues like non-citizens possessing driver’s licenses or state IDs. “We know that non-citizens are illegally voting in past elections,” said Lucas, citing examples from Virginia and Texas. He stressed the need for legislation like the “Save American Elections Act” to combat this threat, concluding with a call for the War Room audience to engage in efforts to safeguard the election process.  In this discussion between Mike Davis and Jeff Clark, they reacted to an article by Eli Honig in New York Magazine that criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith and Judge Tanya Chutkan for their handling of Donald Trump’s legal case following the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity. Jeff Clark noted that the original title of the article, “Jack Smith’s October Surprise,” was changed to “Jack Smith’s October Cheap Shot.” He emphasized that Honig, a former prosecutor and frequent critic of Trump, acknowledged Smith’s disregard for legal norms, saying Smith had “abandoned all objectivity” and shredded the Justice Department’s manual, violating Trump’s due process rights. Clark echoed these concerns, describing Smith’s actions as unconstitutional and designed to interfere with the 2024 election by releasing unexamined evidence against Trump. Davis added that this behavior amounts to “jury pool tampering” and “electoral pool tampering.” They discussed how a future Trump administration should reform the Justice Department, including firing Jack Smith and FBI Director Chris Wray, and ensuring that the department focuses on real crime rather than pursuing January 6th participants. Clark highlighted the need to align the DOJ’s role with the president’s authority, in line with constitutional principles.  Natalie Winters highlighted a recent DOD memo that had made changes in definitions about Assassinations.  Lee Smith talked about a recent article of his titled The FBI Entraps Another Fake Assassin and spoke about other groups who are elevating the theory that the men who tried to assassinate President Trump are fake.  Natalie Winters criticizes the response to Hurricane and the Biden-Harris administration’s approach to the suffering of people impacted as being like a Death to America chant.  Kari Bailey-Chapman talked about her concerns that the EV regulations of the Biden and Harris administrations and by the Democrats in general were actually to ban the combustion engine and how their regulations could actually favor governments and groups who are far less eco-friendly than the United States.  Natalie Winters questioned why Deoocart voting groups were not concerned about the voting problems in areas that are damaged by Hurricane Helene last week.  Natalie Winters talked about her continuing theme of why she is frustrated with Republicans and why she believes Republicans do not want President Trump to win the 2024 Presidential election, and she talked about her anger with Speaker Mike Johnson.   </p>
