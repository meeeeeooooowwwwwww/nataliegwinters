				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> May 13, 2024</p>
                <p>Corporate media Cold opens showed MSNBC Morning Joe footage of the MJ couple reading headlines about Republicans accepting the 2024 elections and footage of President Trump speaking at his historic rally in New Jersey on Sunday.  According to CNN footage, there was a discussion of polling that shows that Trump is up by 15 points. “You never hear them talking about the 81 Million votes Biden got, because he didn’t get them. We are only going to accept the results of an open, free, and fair election,” Steve Bannon 5/13/24 Highlights: Steve Bannon recommitted to getting Mike Johnson removed as Speaker and set the stage for why it is so important for people to fight for transparency over the 2020 election. Rudy Giuliani talked about how far the left has gone with their usurpations and announced the location of his new podcast. John Eastman talked about his popular event uncovering election integrity. Mike Lindell discussed the lawfare leveled at him and MyPillow over election claims, reconfirmed that he will remain vigilant over demanding transparency, and explained his plan for monitoring the 2024 election. Patrick K. O’Donnell talked about his book, The Unvanquished. Ben Harnwell gave his analysis of the Ukraine War. Andrew Giuliani reported live from the courthouse in New York City. Myles Grimard  CEO of Field of Greens talked about his company and the support he has gotten from the WarRoom audience. Natalie Winters appeared to talk about her WarRoom article. Recommended reading: Finish What We Started: The MAGA Movement’s Ground War to End Democracy The world’s economic order is breaking down The Unvanquished: The Untold Story of Lincoln’s Special Forces, the Manhunt for Mosby’s Rangers, and the Shadow War That Forged America’s Special Operations Recommended viewing: LIVE: Uncovering the Truth (E1): Sunday, May 12, 2024 with Rudy Giuliani Full show in segments: Steve Bannon reacted to what may be the largest political rally in modern-day history. Trump reportedly drew 100,000 people to New Jersey, a typical Democrat stronghold. According to Bannon, this shows the movement of a Populist—America First movement that is draining new voters in multiple categories. Bannon cited corporate media and appeared to be in a panic about Trump’s surging popularity.  Steve Bannon pointed out the dire situation for Democrats and opponents of Donald Trump’s America First agenda because their schemes at lawfare have fallen apart. Bannon discussed the American people’s concerns over election integrity and the efforts of some Patriots to address alleged irregularities from the 2020 election. Bannon talked about figures like Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman and emphasized the importance of transparency and vigilance to safeguard democracy. He criticized attempts to silence discussion of election concerns and stressed the need for free and honest elections to uphold the Republic. Despite challenges, they expressed confidence in their movement’s ability to defend democratic principles.  Attorney John Eastman suffered major consequences in his defense of needed election transparency, and he told Steve Bannon about the popularity of his message. Eastman shared information about activist groups he was aware of using the 2020 election to continue working toward transparency, highlighting several legitimate complaints from voters.  Mike Lindell talked to Steve Bannon about his plans to flip large groups of Democrats. He highlighted some of the painful repercussions he has faced due to demanding more election integrity over the suspicious 2020 election. Lindell laid out some of the plans he knew about regarding how patriot groups will safeguard the 2024 election in new ways. Lindell also talked about special deals for the WarRoom Possee at MyPillow.com.  Natalie Winters talked to Steve Bannon about the process of becoming a Claremont Institute Fellow and what she would be learning. She also highlighted a recent article she wrote for the WarRoom.  Author Patrick K. O’Donnell talked about his new book, The Unvanquished, and his very favorable interactions with the WarRoom audience members who attended his book launch events and participated with O’Donnell. The book is a best seller and gets excellent reviews. Mentioned: The Unvanquished: The Untold Story of Lincoln’s Special Forces, the Manhunt for Mosby’s Rangers, and the Shadow War That Forged America’s Special Operations   Former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani talked about the severe consequences he has suffered from having remained vigilant over election integrity, having just been fired from a job a few days ago, over his online discussions about the 2020 election. Giuliani talked about the lawfare, the importance of pursuing transparency, and his motivation to keep trying to hold people accountable, even when he has lost so much.  Andrew Giuliani appeared live from the President Trump trial in New York City and provided insight into Michael Cohen’s testimony from Monday. He noted the prosecution’s struggle to rebuild Cohen’s credibility after he was exposed for lying numerous times. Giuliani portrays Cohen, a self-proclaimed fixer, as a source of chaos. Despite attempts to discredit Cohen, the prosecution faces challenges, as his credibility remains tarnished. Corporate mainstream media coverage highlights the trial’s significance, with Giuliani urging transparency in reporting.  Myles Grimard, CEO of Field of Greens, discussed his company and the support he has received from the WarRoom audience.  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history. </p>
