                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/19/2024 [PM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> November 19, 2024</p>
                <p>Alex Jones and Steve Bannon discussed the ongoing legal and financial turmoil surrounding Jones’ media platform, InfoWars. Jones described the situation as an unprecedented case of “lawfare,” alleging bankruptcy fraud and irregularities in an auction process meant to determine InfoWars’ ownership. According to Jones, the process was manipulated by Democrat-affiliated groups and Justice Department officials to undermine him and seize control of his brand. Jones recounted how the auction, supposedly authorized by a judge, shifted to a secretive and rigged bid favoring a politically connected group. This group allegedly pledged future earnings from defamation lawsuits against Jones, despite such bids being legally questionable. He highlighted that his team filed lawsuits against this process, claiming it violated bankruptcy laws. The judge overseeing the case expressed confusion and concern about the auction’s legitimacy. Jones detailed the immediate fallout, including a drastic drop in revenue and misinformation campaigns that confused supporters into believing his operations had ceased. He accused his adversaries of seeking to destroy the InfoWars brand by turning it into a parody site promoting progressive ideals, as revealed in internal documents and public statements. Despite these challenges, Jones vowed to continue broadcasting, asserting that his primary revenue streams remain intact. Bannon praised Jones’ resilience, likening his fight to the broader struggle against “weaponized” legal tactics targeting dissenting voices. Jones urged his audience to stay informed via his backup platforms while his legal battles unfold.  Mike Benz highlighted key dynamics surrounding the resistance to Donald Trump’s presidency and his potential second term, focusing on the battle for strategic appointments, particularly the FBI director. He underscored the entrenched opposition from establishment forces aiming to suppress Trump’s populist-nationalist agenda. Benz noted that this resistance manifests through coordinated efforts by the intelligence, media, and tech sectors to marginalize populist voices. Central to his critique was Mike Rogers, a former intelligence leader and contender for FBI director. Benz argued Rogers is emblematic of the establishment’s censorship apparatus, citing his affiliation with the Atlantic Council and its role in training journalists to identify "disinformation,” particularly targeting Trump. He linked Rogers to the CIA-backed International Republican Institute (IRI), which purportedly orchestrates global censorship initiatives, including Brazil’s anti-misinformation laws and the EU’s Digital Services Act. Benz contrasted Rogers with Cash Patel, a staunch Trump ally and advocate for government reform, emphasizing Patel’s alignment with the MAGA movement’s goals. He criticized the potential nomination of Rogers as compromising Trump’s agenda, asserting that the FBI director must share a cohesive vision with the Justice Department to avoid sabotage. The discussion also touched on broader institutional challenges, including the State Department’s alleged complicity in promoting censorship and undermining Trump’s policies. Benz concluded that Trump’s team must navigate complex political negotiations to secure appointees aligned with populist values while contending with establishment resistance.  Steve Bannon outlined a strategy for President Trump’s potential second term, emphasizing the importance of judicial appointments and Senate control. He highlighted the opportunity to appoint 20–25 judges early in the term, contrasting Biden’s current tally of over 300 judicial confirmations. Bannon criticized the Senate’s focus on an omnibus bill, arguing it distracts from critical battles such as blocking Biden’s judicial picks and combating Democratic strategies like pre-emptive hearings to target conservative figures. He stressed the need for “all hands on deck” in both the Senate and House to delay funding resolutions until after Trump’s inauguration, enabling a Republican-led budget overhaul. Bannon urged swift preparations for confirmations, recommending flooding the zone with nominees to overwhelm opposition and alleviate pressure on more controversial candidates. Bannon also endorsed figures like Russ Vought for leadership roles, citing their expertise in budget management. He called for rejecting inflated budgets, advocating for significant cuts to wasteful spending. Shifting focus, Bannon highlighted grassroots movements like Public Square as alternatives to mainstream commerce, aligning economic choices with conservative values. Lastly, he dismissed narratives undermining Trump’s mandate, asserting the former president’s legitimacy through popular and electoral victories while rallying conservatives to stay engaged in ongoing political fights.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon discussed the urgency of addressing critical economic, fiscal, and political challenges under a potential Trump administration. They emphasized the need for decisive action to combat rising debt, inefficient spending, and structural economic issues. Patrick highlighted specific priorities: reallocating unspent COVID and infrastructure funds to meaningful programs, closing the southern border to save on welfare costs, and expanding domestic energy production to bolster national wealth. He noted these efforts must complement growth-driven policies, as spending cuts alone cannot address the $2 trillion deficit. Bannon underscored the economic challenges exacerbated by government-driven employment and stagnant productivity, warning that the current system is unsustainable. He stressed that Trump’s team must implement supply-side reforms, tackle the deficit, and address the looming expiration of tax cuts for the middle and working classes. The duo also addressed geopolitical tensions and the economic fallout from the Ukraine war as critical areas requiring immediate attention. On practical steps, Patrick recommended using Birch Gold for hedging investments through precious metals as a safeguard against economic instability. Together, they urged viewers to remain vigilant and proactive in the fight for economic recovery and political accountability.  Natalie Winters addressed the residence and sabotage of President Trump, his picks to lead his administration, and his America First policies by the elite in the media and in government jobs in Washington DC, who were continuing on in their efforts as public servants to thwart Trump and his supporters.  Activist Cleta Mitchell gives an update on the Elections she is following from around the country that have still not been called.  Cleta Mitchell talks to Steve Bannon about replacing part of the National Voter Registration Act. </p>
