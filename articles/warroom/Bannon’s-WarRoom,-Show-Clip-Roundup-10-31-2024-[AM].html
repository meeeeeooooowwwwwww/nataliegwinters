                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/31/2024 [AM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> October 31, 2024</p>
                <p>Steve Bannon’s recent remarks highlight the War Room’s intense focus on mobilizing voters for upcoming elections, aiming to secure a major victory for the MAGA movement. Positioned in Washington, D.C., near the Capitol, Bannon described the movement’s current state as a battle between grassroots mobilization and established opposition. He criticized what he sees as "delegitimization” efforts reminiscent of tactics used against Trump in 2016 and emphasized the need for supporters to rally in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona to help ensure voting integrity. Bannon called for "mass mobilization” efforts, outlining plans for comprehensive coverage by his team, including appearances from figures like Peter Navarro, Natalie Winters, and Charlie Kirk. He expressed confidence in winning if supporters stay vigilant, particularly with early voting. Stressing the stakes, he compared the current fight to a “match play” contest in golf, where victory hinges on reaching the electoral threshold of 270 votes. This approach, he noted, aligns with the Founding Fathers’ vision of the U.S. as a constitutional republic rather than a simple democracy. Bannon explained that the War Room’s strategy relies on grassroots activism rather than large monetary contributions or media campaigns. He emphasized the role of Christian voters and encouraged faith-based communities to view participation as a moral duty, framing this moment as a "spiritual war.” In Bannon’s view, the stakes are existential, calling for steadfast dedication to the cause to secure a political win and a reclamation of cultural values. The push, he added, is merely the beginning of a larger process in the ongoing populist movement.  Dave Brat’s remarks emphasize the crucial role of mobilizing Christian voters in key states to secure electoral victories. He believes that a strong Christian turnout could tip the scales in places like Arizona and Virginia, aligning with a “match play” strategy to win targeted electoral votes rather than a broad sweep. Brat urges Christian communities to organize by reaching out to their congregational lists, encouraging pastors to send voting reminders, and focusing on economic concerns, the border situation, and religious values. By leveraging grassroots efforts similar to those he used in his own campaign, Brat contends that an active, unified Christian electorate could bring about decisive results. “If we all do that, 100 million folks show up, and it’s game over,” he says, calling for a concerted effort among traditional Christian voters to show up and vote for their values.  Steve Bannon and Scott Presler underscore the urgent push for Republican voter mobilization in key areas, especially Pennsylvania. Bannon lauds Presler as the “Johnny Appleseed” of grassroots voter engagement, crediting him with tireless dedication. Presler highlights efforts in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where Republican turnout is surging and Democrat voter registration is dwindling. He notes that Democrats had “voter protection” groups aimed at limiting Republican voting, leading to an extended early voting period due to a court ruling. The numbers are promising: the Democrat lead of 1.1 million voters in 2020 is now down to 387,000, a significant shift. Presler emphasizes, “We have every metric going in our direction,” but warns against complacency. He stresses the need for outreach across demographics—veterans, hunters, young men and women—and encourages engaging voters at everyday locations like gas stations and supermarkets to ensure everyone has a voting plan. Bannon and Presler both emphasize that this level of mobilization is crucial to victory, with Presler adding, "You vote like your very lives depend on winning this November.” Bannon observes a visible enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans, attributing it to an uncharismatic Democrat candidate. He encourages continued community organizing, asserting, "This is a time to unite black, white, brown, blue-collar… that’s the new populist.” Presler and Bannon’s unified message is clear: relentless grassroots engagement is essential to secure a decisive turnout on Election Day.  Steve Bannon and Breitbart’s Matt Boyle are marking a historic shift as Republicans lead early voting in battleground states like Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada—traditionally Democratic strongholds. For the first time, GOP early voting is up, thanks to outreach efforts that are successfully drawing in "low-propensity” voters who are less likely to withstand long Election Day lines. The GOP’s targeted early turnout in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin is crucial, as flipping even one of these states could pave Trump’s path to victory. Early voting numbers in Pennsylvania show potential Democratic vulnerability, with the GOP gaining ground in traditionally blue regions, aided by a legal win that preserved early voting in Bucks County. Boyle highlights that this surge is largely due to grassroots mobilization by alternative media, social platforms, and influencers like Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk, who have driven a powerful GOTV (Get Out the Vote) effort to rally men and other key demographics to vote early. As Boyle and Bannon emphasize, the GOP’s plan to beat Democrats at their own game of early mobilization has worked, but they urge Republicans to push hard through Election Day, particularly focusing on male voter turnout to cement their gains.   Natalie Winters discussed the importance of election officials counting only the ballots of certifiable legal votes and bypassing illegal votes.  Mike Benz exposes the tactics of censoring the social media posts of Conservatives.  Darren Beattie discusses his coverage on Revolver News of Jamie Raskin objecting to President Trump’s victory after the votes are counted.  Rudy Giuliani passionately emphasized the importance of mobilizing efforts for the upcoming election, urging Americans to stay vigilant and proactive. Reflecting on past elections, Giuliani warned of potential threats, stating, "They tried everything,” referring to alleged attempts to disqualify candidates and influence outcomes. He voiced concerns about extreme actions, cautioning that "they may try to kill you,” while adding, "I wouldn’t exclude that possibility,” drawing on his experience as an investigator. Giuliani advised supporters to get involved by volunteering for the party and organizations like Turning Point, emphasizing that greater turnout and oversight could help secure election integrity. He noted, "The more people we can turn out for inspections, the more frightened they get.” Giuliani encouraged the public to stay engaged, adding, "Don’t sit back; there’s something you can do,” stressing active participation on the days leading up to Election Day. </p>
