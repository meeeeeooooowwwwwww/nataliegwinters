                	<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/11/2024 [AM]</h2>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 11, 2024</p>
                <p>Steve Bannon hosted the Thursday Morning WarRoom program. The Cold opens on Thursday morning from MSNBC, highlighting commentary of author Isaac Arnsdorf’s coverage of Steve Bannon. Guests covered topics from the MAGA movement formation, populism, democracy,  Fights on the Hill over Ukraine and FISA, the Southern border, and the victories and defeats of the WarRoom-MAGA movement. Today’s discussion includes a surprise conversation about Golf- don’t miss that. Highlights: Steve Bannon talked about a looming ‘1932 type of realignment’ in politics. Isaac Arnsdorf author of ‘Finish What We Started’ talked about his book Rep. Victoria Spartz, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, Indiana, warns that America is losing our Constitutional Republic Dave Bratt from Liberty University and Bratt Economics talked about the FED Joel Pollak Senior Editor of Breitbart News talked about Hamas’ attacks in Israel Josh Pettit, founder of Allister Makenzie Institute, talked about the upcoming Masters tournament and the history of golf. Ben Bergquam from Frontline America and Real America’s Voice talked about drug cartels and Mayorkas Natalie Dominguez of Home Title Lock Reccomended reading: Trump has Institutional Home thanks to Bannon Finish What We Started (Bannon said he will address this book at Thursday’s Las Vegas event) Recommend Action: Sign up for Las Vegas event Full show in clips: The conversation revolves around the promotion of Isaac Arnsdorf’s book, “Finish What We Started,” which delves into the grassroots movement within the Republican Party, particularly focusing on the MAGA movement’s efforts to reshape the  Republican Party’s direction. The conversation highlights the unique perspective presented in the book, which is based on extensive interviews and real-life experiences of working-class individuals involved in the political process. Steve Bannon praises the book for its authenticity and depth, emphasizing the importance of understanding the perspectives of everyday Americans rather than solely focusing on political insiders and operatives. Arnsdorf explains his motivation for writing the book, aiming to capture the essence of the transformative period in American politics over the past four years. Key points discussed include the clash between grassroots MAGA supporters and establishment Republicans, the challenges faced by newcomers within the party hierarchy, and the potential implications of the MAGA movement’s influence on American democracy. The conversation concludes with Bannon reflecting on the book’s impact. Finish What We Started (Bannon said he will address this book at Thursday’s Las Vegas event)  The discussion involves Steve Bannon and Congressman Victoria Sparks, who addresses concerns about Russian propaganda infiltrating conservative media and influencing Republican viewpoints on supporting Ukraine. Sparks emphasizes the importance of standing up for democracy and assisting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. Additionally, Sparks expresses skepticism about President Biden’s handling of the Ukraine situation and suggests providing lethal aid to Ukraine while awaiting potential leadership changes. The conversation also touches on issues such as the southern border, NSA surveillance, and the need for congressional oversight. Throughout the discussion, Sparks advocates for protecting constitutional rights and maintaining vigilance against government overreach.  In this conversation between Steve Bannon and Dave Brat, they discuss various issues related to the Federal Reserve, government spending, FISA surveillance, and Ukraine. They criticize the Fed for handling the economy, accusing it of excessively printing money and causing inflation. Brat argues that grassroots movements are holding politicians accountable for irresponsible spending, highlighting the importance of the Trump movement in this regard. They also express concerns about FISA surveillance and the lack of respect for American citizens’ privacy rights. Additionally, they question the Intelligence Committee’s handling of the Ukraine situation, accusing them of insulting the American people and misrepresenting the issue. Throughout the discussion, Brat emphasizes the importance of understanding these complex issues and calls for greater accountability and protection of individual rights.   Josh Pettit, founder of the Alister Mackenzie Institute, joined Steve Bannon to discuss the significance of Dr. Alister Mackenzie in the world of golf, particularly in relation to Augusta National and the Masters tournament. Dr. Mackenzie, considered one of the greatest golf course architects, designed Augusta National just before his death in 1934. His philosophy aimed to make golf courses accessible to all, emphasizing populist ideals. Pettit’s institute aims to preserve Dr. Mackenzie’s legacy by researching his life and career, and they plan to open a museum dedicated to him. Despite the elitism associated with Augusta today, Dr. Mackenzie’s vision was to create golf courses for everyone, akin to the public accessibility of St. Andrews in Scotland. For those interested in learning more about Dr. Mackenzie, Pettit directs them to the Alister Mackenzie Institute website and social media channels.  Mike Lindell joined Steve Bannon to discuss recent developments, including Arizona’s decision to sign an audit and other states following suit. Lindell highlighted special deals available at his store, including free shipping week for the War Room Posse. He emphasized various discounted products, such as the My Pillow 2.0 and premium pillows, along with towels and other items. Lindell also mentioned supporting entrepreneurs through his store and provided a promo code for listeners to use. He expressed gratitude to the War Room Posse for their support during challenging economic times.     This newsletter is to put into action the work of WarRoom guests.  Remember-"Action, Action, Action,” as Steve Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said , adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.</p>
