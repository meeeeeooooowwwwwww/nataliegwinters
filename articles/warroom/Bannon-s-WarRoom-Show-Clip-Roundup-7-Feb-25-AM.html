					<p>Steve Bannon and Lance Wallnau discussed the role of Christian nationalism in American politics, particularly under the Trump administration in 2025. Bannon introduced Wallnau as a key voice in the movement, emphasizing its growth as a response to what they see as leftist overreach and anti-Christian bias within the federal government.</p>
				
					<p>Wallnau defined Christian nationalism as an extension of traditional nationalism, prioritizing national sovereignty and cultural preservation while rejecting ideologies like communism and transgender policies. He argued that the left has mischaracterized the movement as “white Christian nationalism” to delegitimize it.</p>
				
					<p>The discussion touched on efforts to remove anti-Christian bias in the government, with Bannon highlighting Pam Bondi’s role in leading a federal task force on religious discrimination. They framed Trump as an unlikely but effective champion for Christian causes, suggesting his leadership disrupts the establishment’s grip on power.</p>
				
					<p>Bannon and Wallnau also criticized government agencies, particularly USAID, as infiltrated by “demonic” influences, echoing broader concerns about deep-state corruption. They pointed to cases like the Idaho National Guard’s alleged exclusion of Christian officers as evidence of systemic bias against religious conservatives.</p>
				
					<p>Overall, the conversation positioned Trump and his allies as warriors in a spiritual and political battle to reclaim America’s Christian identity.</p>
				
					<p>Dave Brat and Steve Bannon discussed the resurgence of Christian nationalism and its impact on American politics. Brat emphasized Trump’s renewed faith following an assassination attempt, quoting his remarks on America’s divine mission and the need to restore religion. Lance Wallnau highlighted America’s history of religious awakenings and the current push for a Christian reformation, stressing the need to recapture institutions like media, business, and government.</p>
				
					<p>He outlined a three-pronged approach: legislation, litigation, and shaping public opinion. They discussed the Supreme Court case on Catholic charter schools as a crucial battle for religious freedom and school choice. Bannon noted the left’s fear of Christian nationalism, calling it a potent ideological force. Brat underscored the necessity for Christian leaders to be bold and active in shaping culture. The discussion framed faith as central to America’s future and a tool to counter globalist influences.</p>
				
					<p>Steve Bannon warns that the government is heading toward a shutdown on March 14, 2025, unless serious budget cuts are made. He criticizes House and Senate leadership for repeatedly passing continuing resolutions (CRs) instead of addressing spending issues. Bannon highlights that Rep. Thomas Massie was the only Republican to vote against the last funding bill, which merely delayed the crisis.</p>
				
					<p>He stresses that USAID and other spending programs will continue unless major structural changes occur. He argues that President Trump’s first-year budget in a second term could end up resembling a Biden-Pelosi budget if no action is taken. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $2 trillion deficit, which Bannon calls unsustainable.</p>
				
					<p>He criticizes Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate leaders for failing to cut unnecessary expenditures, particularly at the Pentagon. Bannon insists that reconciliation bills must include real spending reductions, not just promises of future cuts. He calls for immediate action, warning that rising debt and inflation will worsen without decisive leadership.</p>
				
					<p>Ultimately, he urges conservatives to fight against another long-term CR, warning that failure to act will trap Trump’s administration in a financial mess created by the current government.</p>

					<p>In their discussion, Dave Brat and Steve Bannon outline their concerns about U.S. federal spending and taxation. Bannon critiques the current system, emphasizing how politicians rely on “fantasyland” figures like EBITDA while ignoring cash flow. He stresses that proper financial accountability comes from understanding the balance sheet and actual cash, not the inflated figures often presented. Brat criticizes the lack of political will to cut federal spending, highlighting the absurdity of temporary solutions like continuing resolutions.</p>
				
					<p>Bannon, in turn, supports President Trump’s tax proposals, particularly those that eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security. He champions these ideas as vital for the middle and working class, strongly backing Trump’s efforts. However, both recognize the more significant issue of growing deficits, warning that while tax cuts are pro-growth, they must be paired with substantial spending cuts. Bannon argues that cuts should start with discretionary spending, including defense, where he believes costs can be reduced without compromising security. They agree on the necessity of addressing waste in social programs and foreign aid. Ultimately, they conclude that either spending must be drastically reduced or additional taxes must be found to balance the budget and ensure long-term financial stability.</p>

					<p>Part Two:</p>
				
					<p>John Amanchukwu talked about his foundation and the repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which he supported.</p>
				
					<p>Steve Bannon critiques U.S. foreign aid, particularly USAID, calling it a wasteful “slush fund” and a tool for political control. He links it to the CIA and its role in shaping global policy, including funding NGOs at the southern border and suppressing free speech. He argues that Republican leadership, particularly figures like Paul Ryan, failed to audit or meaningfully review these activities, which enabled Democrats to run wild. Bannon also criticizes the U.S.’s imperialist tendencies post-WWII, and the Pentagon’s entanglement with Silicon Valley, which he sees as a source of political corruption. He stresses the urgency of cutting federal spending, especially in the face of growing threats from China, and advocates for stronger action against the Chinese Communist Party. Bannon suggests disengagement from Ukraine, especially considering its mineral resources, and questions the effectiveness of U.S. foreign military commitments. He concludes with a call for more pragmatic, American-centered policies.</p>
				
					<p>Steve Bannon breaks down the protocols of a foreign dignitary visiting the White House and details about the press pool invited to cover such events.</p>
