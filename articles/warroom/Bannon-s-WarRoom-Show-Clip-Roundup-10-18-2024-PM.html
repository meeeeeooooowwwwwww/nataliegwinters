<h2>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/18/2024 [PM]</h2>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> October 18, 2024</p>
<p>Natalie Winters highlights the National Pulse article with Steve Bannons complete statement from prison regarding his incarceration.  Natalie Winters comments on the influx of unvetted Chinese nationals entering the U.S., highlighting that around 60,000 have entered in the past 18 months, with many passing through the southern border. She points out that these Chinese migrants are not typical immigrants but are from the wealthy and elite classes. Winters suggests that they are well-funded, possibly even supported by the Chinese government, and are not living in the U.S. as low-wage workers like many other migrants. Instead, they are affluent professionals, raising concerns about their motivations and the lack of thorough vetting.  Dan Fleuette and Natalie Winters discuss Fleuette’s long association with Steve Bannon. Fleuette has worked with him for over 20 years, starting with a 2003 documentary. Fleuette has been involved in various media projects with Bannon, including graphic novels and documentaries, and continues collaborating with WarRoom Films. He expresses frustration over Bannon’s legal challenges, labeling his imprisonment unjust and a result of a two-tier justice system targeting political opponents. Fleuette highlights the broader issue of "lawfare,” where government power is allegedly used against dissenting voices. The conversation shifts to Fleuette’s latest project, Rebels, Rouges, and Outlaws, a pictorial history featuring portraits, stories, and observations. Fleuette shares his excitement about the project, revealing that Winters is featured in the book, complimenting her on her growth in the media space. He humorously notes that Winters is starting to resemble Bannon in her work, implying her increasing influence in political commentary.  Todd Bensman and Natalie Winters discuss the immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, focusing on the influx of migrants, including a significant number of wealthy Chinese nationals. Bensman highlights that many immigrants are closely watching the U.S. elections, fearing a potential Trump victory, which they believe would shut down the border, prompting them to rush into the U.S. He notes that wealthy Chinese immigrants, unlike others, can afford cartel passage due to their financial resources, possibly backed by the Chinese government. Additionally, Bensman observes an influx of migrants from across Asia, Africa, and beyond, turning border towns like Tapachula, Mexico, into overcrowded "pressure cookers” filled with people waiting to cross into the U.S. The Biden administration’s CBP One mobile app allows some to secure appointments for border entry, easing pressure in these towns. Bensman emphasizes the chaotic nature of the situation, with migrants flooding in from around the globe, creating a complex humanitarian and political challenge.  In the discussion between Natalie Winters and Nate Hochman, they talk about the impact of mass immigration on small towns like Charleroi, Pennsylvania, which has seen a significant influx of Haitian immigrants. Hochman a senior advisor for America 2100, describes how Charleroi, a de-industrialized town with just over 4,000 native residents, has been overwhelmed by a 1,500% increase in foreign population since 2020. He emphasizes that the local residents were never consulted about this massive demographic shift, which he describes as part of a broader pattern of small, conservative towns being overwhelmed by immigration, driven by a combination of government programs, NGOs, and big business interests. Hochman suggests that this mass migration is coordinated and punishes these communities for their conservative, pro-America values. He also discusses how the media has downplayed or fact-checked these claims, often relying on a few handpicked activists to dispute the scale of the problem. Hochman and Winters agree that the transformation of these towns has led to significant tensions, with overwhelmed school districts, housing shortages, and strained local resources, yet media coverage often portrays these communities as resistant without addressing the real issues they face.  Joe Allen, standing in for Steve Bannon on War Room, discusses the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its psychological impact on society. He emphasizes that AI has evolved to the point where it can communicate with humans in ways that create the illusion of an entity on the other side. Allen points out that AI systems can now organize and relay information independently, but the real concern is the growing number of people who turn to AI for truth, even on spiritual matters. He cites predictions that AI could give rise to new religions and influence spiritual beliefs. Allen also highlights the political divide surrounding AI, with figures like Sam Altman and Eric Schmidt aligned with the left, while Elon Musk and Peter Thiel lean right. However, Allen stresses that the future will be shaped more by technology than politics, noting that politicians will have to grapple with difficult decisions related to AI and its power. Ultimately, he views this as a spiritual war, with political power secondary to higher, divine guidance.  In their discussion, Noor Bin Ladin and Joe Allen delve into concerns about the “intelligent age” and its technological advancements, particularly as framed by elites like Klaus Schwab and tech figures like Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Bin Ladin praises Allen’s critique of this new era and expresses distrust toward the “progress” being driven by these elites, noting that what they view as a utopia could become a dystopia for the rest of society. She emphasizes that these technological changes often benefit a few while negatively impacting the broader population. While Altman and others seem excited about the digital future, Bin Ladin remains skeptical and concerned about the societal consequences. Despite her reservations about technology’s impact, she remains optimistic, grounded in her belief in God and the human spirit, which she believes will help people overcome the challenges ahead.  Grace Chong emphasized the importance of early voting, urging viewers to participate and mobilize others, while acknowledging that some may prefer voting on election day. Joe Allen confirms he is registered but hasn’t voted yet, expressing his commitment to voting his conscience. He praises Chong for her motivation and energy in rallying the supporters, encouraging everyone to remain positive and focused on achieving victory in the upcoming election. The discussion reflects a sense of urgency and excitement among Trump supporters as they push for turnout in the 2024 election.  In their discussion, Joe Allen and Jennifer Billek delve into the themes of Billek’s book, Transsual: Transgender Transhuman. Billek emphasizes that transgenderism and transhumanism are not merely identities but efforts to redefine humanity through technology. She argues that these movements aim to alter societal perceptions of sexuality, detaching them from biological realities and promoting a synthetic view of identity. Billek critiques the portrayal of these ideologies as organic human rights movements, suggesting instead that they are financially backed by powerful figures and organizations, such as the Pritzker family and Martin Rothblatt, who seek to reshape societal norms. She highlights the potential dangers of such changes, particularly for women, who play a crucial role in reproduction. The conversation underscores concern over how these technological ambitions might undermine the traditional understanding of gender and humanity. </p>
