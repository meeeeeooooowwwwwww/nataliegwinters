<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5/15/2024 [PM]</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Published on:</strong> May 16, 2024</p>
<p>Highlights: Boris Epshteyn talked about the polling numbers for President Trump Julie Kelly spoke about the Weaponization of Government Committee hearing Bradley Delvin talked about the Weaponization of Government hearing. Natalie Winters reacted to getting a shout-out at the Weaponization of Government hearing. Mike Lindell talked about lawfare and pillows- and great deals at MyPillow. Raynard Jackson discussed an event he is hosting with keynote speaker Steve Bannon. Christine Serrano Glassner talked about her race for Senate in New Jersey. Eduardo Verastegui talked about his movie- Sound of Freedom- and his struggles in Mexico, as he tried to run for President and experienced censorship. Boris Epshteyn expressed concern about the politicization of law enforcement and the justice system, particularly in the context of President Trump’s ongoing scrutiny. Epshteyn suggested that attacks against Trump are backfiring on Democrats, and he highlights the support the former president continues to receive, saying that Trump’s popularity is surging into dominance.  Steve Bannon discussed various topics with Julie Kelly, including recent events and concerns about law enforcement and political maneuvering. Kelly touched on the congressional hearings on Weaponization, the Michael Cohen situation, and also about recent press briefings about election security. Bannon and Kelly discussed potential intimidation tactics related to future elections and criticism of law enforcement actions. Kelly explained a hazardous situation for supporters of President Trump, namely that making general comments about politicians may lead to danger.  Bradley Devlin talked to Steve Bannon about the Weaponization Committee hearing, international affairs, and a tragic event in Slovakia. Devlin mentioned political dynamics, including the importance of cautious engagement and the potential for backroom dealings. The conversation shifts to the attempted assassination of a Ukrainian figure in Slovakia, highlighting its geopolitical significance and the need for global cooperation. The discussion touches on historical context and current challenges facing the region.  Natalie Winters’s name was mentioned at the recent Weaponization of Government congressional hearing, and a tweet of hers was read aloud. She emphasized the significance of platforms like WarRoom and the political force they represent. The conversation between Winters and Steve Bannon shifts to the hearing’s focus on Eco Health Alliance and the Department of Health’s ruling to stop taxpayer funds from going to the organization. Winters cautioned against seeing this as the end, highlighting the need for further investigation into the origins of COVID-19 and broader issues related to collaboration with China. Winters encouraged continued pressure on lawmakers to take action.  Mike Lindell talked about his support of President Trump, some of his plans to capture Democrat votes for Trump, and deals he had for the WarRoom audience.  Christine Serrano Glassner discussed her recent endorsement by President Trump for the Senate race in New Jersey, highlighting the significance of the endorsement for both her campaign and the state itself. She reflects on her family ties to individuals involved in politics and marketing and recounts the success of a recent rally in Wildwood, New Jersey. The conversation shifts to the political landscape in New Jersey, noting the historical dominance of Democratic politics but also the growing support for MAGA policies among the state’s residents. Glassner emphasizes the importance of the economy and border security as key issues driving support for President Trump and her campaign.  Steve Bannon and Raynard Jackson discuss the Minority Conservative Economic Summit, an upcoming event in Washington, D.C. They each highlighted the event’s significance, which aims to empower conservative minority entrepreneurs. Bannon praises the lineup of speakers, including Scott Besan and Ken Langone, and emphasizes the importance of access to capital for entrepreneurial success. Jackson echoes this sentiment, noting the transformative power of capitalism and the potential impact of the summit on the Black community. Jackson provides details on how to attend the event and encourages participation to support the American dream and President Trump’s agenda.  Eduardo Verastegui talked about his experiences and challenges in Mexico, particularly in the political landscape. He expressed his dedication to Mexico and his desire to address corruption and lack of democracy. The success of his efforts, such as the “Sound of Freedom” project and gathering signatures to run for office- when he says he was censored by controlling factions like the Drug Cartels, reflects his commitment to change. However, he acknowledges the ongoing struggle against corruption and the need for further action. Verastegui emphasizes the importance of exposing corruption and fighting for democracy despite facing obstacles and resistance.  Jonathan Keeperman talked to Steve Bannon about how one of his social media posts triggered the Guardian and the events that led up to liberals targeting him.   Keeperman spoke about how he became an enemy of the left.  Bannon was surprised by how Kepperman was the lead story on Monday, with a huge new story.  Keeperman was confused by the attention of the news story as well and talked his work and his projects.  Ben Harnwell talked to Steve Bannon about the attempted Assassination of the Slovak Prime Minister and other news in Europe about the Ukraine War, developments in Russia, and how it impacts the United States.  Harnwell says that the tensions of the war in Ukraine is an economic disaster and destabilized the country.  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history.  </p>
