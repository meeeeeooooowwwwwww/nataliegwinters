                	<h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/13/2024 [PM]</h1>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> November 13, 2024</p>
                <p>Steve Bannon passionately outlined the appointments and vision of the incoming Trump administration, emphasizing the selection of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. He praised Gaetz as a fierce, relentless warrior, referencing his critical role in removing Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Bannon portrayed Gaetz as an anti-establishment figure poised to confront entrenched bureaucratic power, or what he calls the “Deep State.” Bannon suggested Gaetz’s nomination symbolizes Trump’s commitment to dismantling government corruption, with Gaetz as a "blow torch” to the Department of Justice. Additionally, Bannon celebrated the unconventional picks of Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence and other allies like Stephen Miller, signaling a radical reshaping of federal leadership under Trump. He spoke confidently about these individuals’ tenacity and described their intent to "deconstruct the administrative state,” targeting long-standing political figures such as Andrew Weissmann and Andrew McCabe. Bannon suggested that such individuals should prepare for rigorous legal scrutiny, hinting at intensified accountability efforts against perceived corruption. Throughout, Bannon framed the day as a pivotal, transformative moment for America, encouraging supporters to embrace the change they championed. He closed by expressing that this "hero’s journey” was only beginning and that the appointments would be instrumental in realizing Trump’s promise to restore America. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon talks about the factors that have made the re-election of Donald Trump into a mandate by the American people for him to set appointments and policies going forward.  Steve Bannon and Caroline Wren discussed the significance of Trump’s nomination of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. According to Bannon and Wren, Gaetz’s nomination marks a monumental shift in the U.S. political landscape, particularly as Trump seeks to regain control over what he views as a weaponized government. Gaetz, who previously faced DOJ investigations that were later dropped, represents someone uniquely suited to clean up the agency, Bannon argued, since he has experienced the agency’s alleged bias firsthand. Wren and Bannon emphasized that Gaetz’s Senate confirmation hearings could expose what they see as corruption within the DOJ. Bannon noted that the same DOJ that investigated Gaetz could face intense scrutiny during these hearings, potentially revealing evidence of political bias. Wren believes that the hearings might actually work to Gaetz’s advantage, allowing him to expose DOJ actions she describes as unjust. Both Wren and Bannon underscored Gaetz’s strategic skills, with Wren calling him a "master chess player” who’s often underestimated. They anticipate that, while the confirmation process will face opposition, particularly from some Republicans aligned with Mitch McConnell, Gaetz’s nomination could gain enough support. They concluded that Gaetz’s leadership in the DOJ could catalyze broader reforms, with Bannon viewing Gaetz as capable of dismantling what he calls the "deep state” and restoring justice.  Darren Beattie emphasized the critical importance of nominating Matt Gaetz as Attorney General in Trump’s second term, describing Gaetz as someone with a deep understanding of the "Deep State” and the determination needed to reform the Department of Justice (DOJ). Beattie highlighted Gaetz’s personal experience with an FBI investigation and his resilience through the ordeal, which he believes qualifies him to lead reform efforts at the DOJ. According to Beattie, Gaetz’s refusal to back down or compromise sets him apart as a true "warrior” against entrenched governmental corruption. Beattie argued that the DOJ, more than any other agency, represents the heart of American law and order, making its politicization especially dangerous. The current corruption within the DOJ, he contended, has led many Americans to view the country as a “banana republic,” where the justice system is used to target political enemies. For Trump’s administration to effectively combat these issues, Beattie believes Gaetz is essential as Attorney General to confront and dismantle the systemic rot within the DOJ and restore the rule of law. Beattie also encouraged readers to visit Revolver News to explore potential key appointments, including Scott Bessent for Treasury, emphasizing the importance of strategic leadership in advancing Trump’s agenda in a potential second term. Steve Bannon described the foundation of the America First movement as the Working Class Americans.  Steve Bannon delivered a fiery call to action, emphasizing that America stands at a "fork in the road” moment, demanding a drastic shift in governance and transparency. He argued that the administrative "Deep State” — intelligence, law enforcement, military, and media apparatuses — has morphed into a power the Founding Fathers never intended, stifling true democratic principles and forcing economic burdens on the average citizen. Bannon praised figures like Matt Gaetz as embodying courage and resilience against the government’s power. He likened their determination to the profiles in courage from history, insisting that, like him and Trump, they represent a spirit that cannot be broken. Bannon contended that the recent election showed a public mandate for a new form of governance, challenging mainstream portrayals of MAGA supporters as undemocratic. He underscored Trump’s plan to install "warrior” leaders, pledging a transparent, people-driven government. He cited historical resonance, invoking the upcoming 250th anniversary of Lexington and Concord, framing the movement as providential. Finally, Bannon warned that the establishment’s toughness would falter once stripped of power, vowing that the public, once exposed to the "truth,” would back Trump’s cause to restore America.  Natalie Winters talks about her most recent investigation. </p>
