				<p><strong>Published on:</strong> October 25, 2024</p>
                <p>Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts and ideas about Election integrity topics and how Democrats have been responsible for imprisioning numerous supporters of President Trump.  Jim Womack talked about his Election Integrity fundraiser, some of the cases he follows and promotes media interest in, and the media coverage of elections.  Grace Chong read her article from the other day again and discussed Steve’s statement regarding the First Step Act.  She also encouraged the audience to write out postcards for Get Out The Vote efforts.  Natalie Winters talked about her thoughts and feelings about what she calls the Deep State and the Deep State Generals, and she says that they do not support the America First Agenda.  Colin Aamot talked about his frustration that the House Oversight Committee appears to be ignoring some documents that highlight the connections between the Democrat Vice President candidate and his association with the Chinese Communist Party.  Natalie Winters discussed her thoughts and feelings about how a managerial class must get rich by destroying the United States of America.  Darren Beattie talked about the various news organizations and their endorsements or lack of endorsements and said that he felt Joe Biden should endorse Donald Trump.  Karen Sidgemund highlighted the American Freedom Alliance’s recent initiatives, emphasizing efforts to raise awareness about critical security threats. She mentioned past events, including “World War III: The Early Years,” which began in Los Angeles with Steve Bannon’s support. These events have been ongoing, with the latest held in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and available on their Rumble channel due to YouTube’s restrictions. “YouTube can be quite finicky when you address actual reality,” she noted, pointing to censorship challenges. Sidgemund stressed the importance of informed voting, saying their aim is to combat misinformation and provide “true information about the threats” that America faces. Upcoming efforts will focus on disseminating concise video clips to reach broader audiences. According to her, the initiative is about preserving freedoms and protecting the constitutional republic, highlighting that “this is not about politics, it’s about policies.” She encouraged supporters to visit their website, AmericanFreedomAlliance.org, and follow their Rumble and social media platforms for the latest updates. Sidgemund’s mission is clear: to inform the public so they vote from an “informed perspective” rather than being misled by disinformation. Retired U.S. Navy Captain James Fanell, a former senior naval intelligence officer, shared his concerns regarding recent remarks by retired Generals John Kelly and Mark Milley about former President Trump. Fanell, co-author of “Embracing Communist China: America’s Greatest Strategic Failure,” emphasized the seriousness of their statements. He criticized these former military leaders, saying their public accusations, including references to Trump as a “fascist,” breach military ethics. According to Fanell, such behavior undermines the oath they took to defend the Constitution and the principle of civilian control over the military: "They should have formally resigned while they were in office,” if they had such concerns, he asserted. Fanell expressed disappointment with General Milley’s actions, labeling him “arrogant” and an “elitist,” especially given Milley’s lucrative post-retirement roles tied to defense firms. He contrasted this with the integrity shown by past military figures who maintained neutrality, such as George Marshall, who famously refrained from voting to preserve military professionalism. As the conversation transitioned to international concerns, Fanell noted the aggressive behavior of the People’s Republic of China, highlighting its strategic threats to U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region. He urged Americans to reflect on these global challenges when considering their choices in the upcoming election.  Colonel Derek Harvey examined escalating threats posed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and criticized the military leadership of figures like General Milley. Harvey emphasized that the current geopolitical climate is far worse than it was four years ago, stating, "We can say without a doubt that we’re worse off today.” He pointed out recent aggressive maneuvers by China, including the "joint sword 2024 Bravo” exercises, which involved 153 aircraft sorties aimed at testing a blockade of Taiwan. He noted that on one day, China conducted 140 sorties, a significant increase from previous years. "This is a dangerous time,” he warned, highlighting the growing threats in the South China Sea and China’s harassment of Indonesian operations. Colonel Harvey expressed disappointment in military leaders like Milley, stating, "Generals like Milley and Kelly have not been focused on winning.” He criticized them for their political ties, claiming their actions have been influenced by the "authoritarian left.” Harvey warned that the real threats stem from the "weaponization of the DOJ and the FBI,” which he deemed a form of fascism. Furthermore, he expressed concern over Israel’s trust in the U.S. amid rising tensions with Iran. "The United States cannot be trusted by Israel,” he asserted, citing systemic issues within the current administration that view Iran favorably while regarding Israel as the problem. Harvey’s insights underscore the complex interplay of global threats and military leadership inadequacies. </p>
