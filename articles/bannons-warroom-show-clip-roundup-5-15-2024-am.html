                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5/15/2024 [AM]</h1>
                <div>Highlights: E.J. Antoni talked about the disastrous effects of inflation. Jackie Toboroff talked about her research on what happened to change the flag for the State of Minnesota. Mike Lindell talked about lawfare and pillows- and offered a special deal to the WarRoom audience. Jack Posobiec talked about the nationalist-populist movement in Spain. Suggested watching: Weaponization hearing The strategic Common Man CPI, focusing on essentials like food, energy, shelter, clothing, utilities, and insurance, has shown a consistent increase, surpassing official numbers for 9 months straight. Gold has risen in 34 of the last 40 months, indicating inflation as a significant concern. This suggests that inflation is no longer a campaign issue and that Biden may have lost ground on it. EJ Antoni emphasizes that the real impact on Americans’ lives is more severe than the headline numbers suggest, especially in housing costs, which have surged far beyond what official statistics reflect.  Rep. Plaskett spoke at the weaponization hearing and said that President Trump demands absolute loyalty from all his followers and especially from GOP officials and those who work for him.   She pouted that many Americans have flocked to New York City to demonstrate their allegiance, standing with him despite the ongoing investigations. Plaskett moaned that Trump expects every Republican official to use their positions to aid his legal defense, even as criticism mounts, decrying his loyalists, including Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, for openly mocking Republican leaders who they feel aren’t doing enough to defend Trump. Plaskett told the committee that the WarRoom demands action, not just words, insisting that the federal government should actively protect Trump from legal repercussions.   She added that Trump’s supporters in the media echo these sentiments, pressuring Republican leaders to act decisively in Trump’s defense.  Bob Costello told the Weaponization Committee that he was the attorney for the Southern District of New York and denied representing Donald Trump or any of his associates despite having represented other high-profile individuals. He reveals that Michael Cohen, seeking a reduced sentence, accused him and Rudy Giuliani of obstructing justice by tampering with Cohen as a witness. However, the attorney asserted that Cohen lied and explains his interactions with Cohen to authorities, highlighting inconsistencies in Cohen’s claims.  Jackie Turbo raises concerns over the decision to raise an Islamic flag with an 8-pointed star over the state capital of Minnesota, claiming that it does not represent the majority demographic of the state. He highlights the process of appointing a committee to choose the flag design and criticizes the lack of transparency and public input in the decision-making. Turbo argues that the adoption of this flag symbolizes a shift in the state’s identity and questions the Republican Party’s response to the issue, attributing it to Democratic dominance in Minnesota.  Gene Hamilton testified and emphasized the importance of action in pursuing justice and morality to counteract the negative impacts of human ambition. He talked about the founding principles of the American system, emphasizing the need for a strong but not omnipotent federal government that respects individual liberties and prevents tyranny. However, he expresses concern about the current concentration of power in the federal government, particularly under President Biden’s leadership, and suggests that this concentration leads to political persecution and division. The commentary also criticizes attempts to silence dissenting voices through censorship and misinformation labeling.  Mike Lindell reacted to the story about the Islamic flag being flown in Minnesota and talked about Pillow deals for the WarRoom audience.  Patriot Mobile is offering a special deal for the WarRoom audience.  Jack Posbbiec talked about news that was unfolding in Spain focused on current events and also on the rising nationalist-Populist political movement there.  Steve Bannon has a powerful interview with Dr. Peter Navarro’s finance, Bonnie.  Bonnie talked about their relationship, Navarros’ plans once he gets out of prison and a bit about what motivates both of them to stick with their support of President Donald Trump/  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history.  </div>
