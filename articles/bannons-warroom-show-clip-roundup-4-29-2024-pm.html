                <div>Cold opens show groups of campus uprisings and discussions on MSNBC.

Wendi Strauch Mahoney talked about her article in Uncover DC Maureen Bannon talked about her trip to Romania Reccomended reading: America Isn’t The First Empire Doomed By Open Borders Biden Admin Expands Paths to Muslim Refugees with USCIS Announcement Full show in segments: Natalie Winters appeared with Steve Bannon, in three parts: Pt. 1 The discussion revolves around Jake Tapper’s alleged statements regarding the events in Charlottesville, with one participant claiming Tapper said certain individuals should be imprisoned. There’s a broader conversation about the influence of various groups, including those allegedly funded by George Soros, on college campuses and in wider society. Winters argues that a Marxist revolution is underway, with ties to organizations like Hamas and support from certain political figures. She expresses concern about the direction of American culture and politics, particularly regarding Israel, Palestine, and the actions of the Biden administration. Overall, the conversation suggests a belief in a coordinated effort to undermine traditional American values and institutions  Pt.2 Natalie Winters, in this conversation, discusses the disappointment in Republican leaders like Jim Jordan for what’s seen as performative actions rather than meaningful efforts to address issues like the alleged crimes of the Biden family. There’s criticism of Republican staffers for not being committed to real change and instead prioritizing their own positions within the Washington, D.C., political ecosystem. She argues that this lack of genuine action is damaging and reflects a broader problem within the Republican Party of not prioritizing America first. Overall, there’s frustration with the lack of substantive results from Republican efforts and a sense that even conservative media outlets are beginning to criticize such tactics.  Pt. 3  Julie Kelly talked about ongoing legal proceedings involving classified documents and the frustration with perceived injustices within the legal system. The conversation highlights concerns about potential abuses of power and the need for transparency in legal proceedings. Kelly and Bannon talked about the inaction by Republican lawmakers regarding alleged conspiracies against Donald Trump. Criticism is directed at GOP staffers and committees for their lack of response and action. There’s a call for accountability and public testimony from key figures involved in the alleged wrongdoing. The conversation underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for transparency. Julie Kelly’s efforts to uncover information are highlighted, along with avenues for accessing her findings.

Jeremy Carl covered various topics, from historical analogies to contemporary politics. Jeremy Carl discusses the fall of empires due to open borders, drawing parallels to ancient Rome. He addresses the concept of protected classes and the impact of neo-Marxist ideology on institutions like universities and corporations. The conversation touches on international alliances among nationalist movements and concerns about the deep state preventing Trump’s return to power..   Maureen Bannon spoke briefly about her trip to Romania, where she spoke at CPAC about nationalism.  Bannon spoke about the unity that is building among other countries to fight Globalism.  Wendi Strauuch Mahoney talked about her research and her article. Biden Admin Expands Paths to Muslim Refugees with USCIS Announcement  The conversation touches on political dynamics within the Scottish National Party, noting a decline in support and a rejection of woke ideology among party members. The speaker attributes the leader’s downfall to the passage of a radical hate crime bill, which led to backlash from the Scottish people, including prominent figures like JK Rowling. Despite internal divisions, there is still a movement for Scottish independence within the larger context of the United Kingdom.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history. </div>
