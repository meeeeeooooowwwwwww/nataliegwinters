                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5/7/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Cold Open was footage of Speaker Mike Johnson and Majorie Taylor Greene separately talking about and reacting to the day’s events over a potential motion to vacate. Highlights: Julie Kelly Broke the news that Judge Cannon won’t set a new date and hold hearings on Jack Smith. Andrew Giuliani talked about the New York City Trial of Donald Trump. Todd Bensman spoke about his article in the New York Post. Mike Davis talked about how to end lawfare against Republicans. Kash Patel spoke about the Jan. 6th, 2021 National Guard Scandal Reccomended Reading: Why Biden’s Gaza refugee plan is a hard hell no Andrew Giuliani’s Twitter Feed Full show in segments: Julie Kelly reports breaking news in the classified documents case. Judge Alien Cannon has vacated the May 20th trial date and is refusing to set a new one, citing prudence. Instead, she plans to hold key hearings that will likely trouble Jack Smith, Trump’s co-defendant. These hearings include motions to dismiss based on selective and vindictive prosecution, the unlawful appointment of Jack Smith, and a partial evidentiary hearing on the scope of the prosecution team. Cannon’s actions indicate a serious approach to the case, putting pressure on Smith and his team to explain their actions. The burden on Cannon to uncover evidence highlights the lack of oversight from institutions like the House Judiciary Committee. Kelly’s detailed reporting provides crucial insights into the case’s developments.  Andrew Giuliani reports on a tumultuous day in Manhattan court, where a street brawl erupted during proceedings. Giuliani describes the trial as a smear campaign against Donald Trump, with Stormy Daniels’ testimony veering off course. The trial has become highly prejudicial despite the judge’s attempts to rein in the prosecution’s salacious details. Giuliani highlights Stormy Daniels’ admission of a monetary motive, a pivotal moment in the defense’s case. The prosecution’s insistence on including such details suggests a desire to shame Trump rather than focus on factual evidence. Overall, Giuliani emphasizes the biased nature of the trial and the media’s complicity in sensationalizing it.  Today on the show, there was a heated discussion about the Biden administration’s proposal to bring Gaza war refugees into the United States. Todd Bensman, a prominent figure in counterterrorism, highlighted the dangers of such a move, arguing that bringing individuals from an environment of anti-American indoctrination and hostility towards the US would pose significant security risks. He emphasized the need for congressional action to prevent this proposal from being realized. Todd’s insights were shared in an article published in the New York Post, and you can find more of his work on his website and social media channels. Mentioned: Why Biden’s Gaza refugee plan is a hard hell no  Today’s show featured a promotion for My Pillow products, including the My Pillow and various other items like slippers, sandals, and socks. The host highlighted the quality of the products, particularly praising the USA socks as the best he’s ever worn. He also mentioned special deals available, such as discounts on bulk purchases and buy-one-get-one-free offers. Listeners were encouraged to take advantage of these specials by calling the provided phone number.  Natalie Winters talked about corporate media and vaccine injuries from her investigations.  Mike Davis is expressing frustration with the lack of action and defense from Republican politicians regarding various legal issues surrounding former President Trump. He highlights the lack of resistance against Democratic prosecutors and expresses disappointment in the absence of a strong fight, contrasting it with past battles like the confirmation of Supreme Court justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Davis emphasizes the pivotal role of key figures such as President Trump, Don McGann, Mitch McConnell, Mark Paoletta, and himself in ensuring Kavanaugh’s confirmation despite significant opposition. He criticizes many Republican politicians for not showing the same level of commitment and urges them to step up and defend their party’s interests.  The conversation discusses the recent New York Times article confirming that former President Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard before January 6th. This revelation contradicts the narrative that Trump refused to authorize the National Guard. Instead, it was other individuals, including Bowser and Pelosi, who reportedly delayed the deployment. The discussion highlights the chain of command and how certain officials allegedly obstructed Trump’s orders. The conversation criticizes those involved for their actions and calls for accountability. Additionally, it suggests that this information exonerates Trump from any insurrection charges. The conversation ends with a call for further investigation and emphasizes the importance of revealing the truth to the American people.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history. </div>
