                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/7/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Natalie Winters referred to some corporate media reports and their claims that illegals don’t vote.  State Sen. Jake Hoffman talked about what he has seen in his district with Democrats trying to flip the state “blue” to their side and using illegal aliens to vote to help that happen.  Natalie Winters reacts critically to a clip of Andy Weissmann.  Jason Goodman discussed his appearance during the discussion with Andy Weissman (above) and his point of view on what Lawfare is and how it currently impacts politics.  Noor Bin Ladin discussed her experiences with NATO and her theories about the organization’s purpose as a military arm to enforce Globalism.  In a discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell from Rasmussen Reports, they examined the significance of betting markets, particularly PolyMarket, in gauging public perception of the 2024 presidential election. Harnwell noted that Trump’s support has surged in recent betting, leading him by a substantial margin, reflecting public belief that he will win. Mitchell emphasized that while betting markets can fluctuate, polling data is still more reliable. “Polling is more accurate,” Mitchell said, referencing recent Rasmussen data that showed Trump leading by two points in the national popular vote. Mitchell also pointed out that despite left-leaning media narratives, Trump’s lead is becoming undeniable. “At some point, people on the left… are going to have to wake up to the cognitive dissonance,” he stated. He criticized the mainstream media for being slow to report Trump’s gains, suggesting that polling bias might influence their narrative. According to Mitchell, Trump will likely win key swing states like Pennsylvania, with recent data reflecting a growing advantage. Both emphasized that betting markets and polling are converging on the reality that Trump is favored, despite media reluctance to acknowledge it.  Dave Walsh recently discussed Florida’s energy infrastructure, focusing on the challenges posed by the state’s increasing reliance on solar power. He praised linemen working tirelessly to restore power during storms but highlighted flaws in Florida’s energy strategy. According to Walsh, utilities like Duke Energy and FPL are investing billions in solar farms while neglecting reliable energy sources such as gas, nuclear, and coal. "No new gas-fire, combined cycle plants, no new nuclear plants,” Walsh emphasized, criticizing the closure of coal plants and the lack of investment in dependable baseload power. Walsh pointed out that despite massive solar installations, fossil fuel use has increased. "Duke Energy’s fossil fuel utilization is up two percent,” he noted, revealing solar power’s inefficiency in replacing traditional energy sources. Additionally, Walsh expressed concern over the fragmented nature of solar infrastructure, making it harder to maintain during severe weather events like the recent Category 5 hurricane. He also noted that industries dependent on continuous electricity, such as paper mills and steel plants, are ill-served by intermittent solar and wind power. “Solar and wind cannot be the nation’s sole energy source,” Walsh concluded, calling for a shift back to more reliable, continuous power generation methods.   Jim Womack has one of numerous election integrity groups in North Carolina who are concerned about the impact that the damage in Western North Carolina will have on the November election, and he is asking for donations to his group.  Brian Schimming, Chair of the GOP in Wisconsin, praised the recent rally held by Donald Trump in Dodge County, describing the event as highly successful. Schimming noted, “We had well over ten thousand people” in attendance, emphasizing the strong energy and enthusiasm. He observed that the crowd’s intensity felt as though “the election is two days away,” highlighting the excitement for the upcoming election. Schimming shared that people began lining up hours before the rally, with many arriving as early as 6 a.m., showing immense dedication. “There were thousands of cars parked around that airport,” he said, underscoring the scale of the event. One of the key messages from the rally was the importance of early voting. “The biggest banner… was ‘vote early,'” Schimming said, refuting claims that Trump isn’t serious about early voting. Trump stressed the need for early participation, noting that early voting in Wisconsin starts on October 22. Schimming also discussed the economic concerns resonating with Wisconsin voters, tying them to the broader dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration. He remarked, “Kamala Harris has to run away from Joe Biden,” reflecting voter frustration over issues such as the economy, Afghanistan, and the border crisis.  Cliff Mahoney highlighted the extensive efforts underway in Pennsylvania to secure victory in the upcoming election, emphasizing a door-knocking campaign aimed at reaching 500,000 doors. "We’ve nearly hit 200,000 doors,” Mahoney said, confident in their progress. He stressed the importance of fixing the mail-in voting system to win the state, noting that current ballot request numbers favor Republicans. Mahoney described a recent rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as a high-energy event: "The energy in the room…you just don’t see that in the political world.” He believes this election will determine the future of the Republic, asserting, "This is the election that will decide the future.” Comparing mail-in ballot requests to 2020, Mahoney pointed out that Democrats are down 400,000 requests, while Republicans are only down 87,000. He said, "We only lost this state by 80,000 votes,” highlighting the momentum shift. Mahoney expressed optimism about voter enthusiasm, especially among groups traditionally supportive of Democrats, and warned that if Democrats lose, their national viability could be in jeopardy. He encouraged continued efforts to secure victory through targeted voter outreach and ballot chasing, adding that the groundwork laid now is critical to winning Pennsylvania.  Matthew Tragesser highlighted the significant impact of migration policies on Pittsburgh and its suburbs, specifically focusing on the town of Charleroi. He noted that Charleroi has experienced a 2,000% increase in its migrant population over the past two years, a striking statistic considering the town only has around 4,000 residents. According to Tragesser, this surge is causing substantial strain on local resources, including education and public services. Taxpayers are now shouldering an additional financial burden, paying "hundreds of thousands of dollars extra” to accommodate the growing demand for social services and public schools. Tragesser also raised concerns about increased crime and pressure on medical facilities, particularly emergency services, describing the situation as unsustainable for Western Pennsylvania. He linked these local issues to broader national challenges, noting that Pennsylvania’s experience is reflective of what is happening in regions across the country. Tragesser concluded by encouraging viewers to read more about the topic on Fox News and follow his updates on Twitter, where he continues to cover the evolving situation in Pennsylvania and beyond. </div>
