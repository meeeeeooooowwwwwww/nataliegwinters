                <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/8/2024 [PM]</h1>
                <div>Natalie Winters, Brian Kennedy and Michael Anton discussed critical concerns regarding the integrity of upcoming elections and the broader implications of political and administrative actions. The conversation began with a focus on the weaponization of government and the risks associated with election administration, particularly the potential for interference by foreign entities such as Communist China. Brian Kennedy, a prominent figure from the Committee on the Present Danger: China, expressed his deep concerns about the possibility of election manipulation through mail-in ballots. He argued that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was leveraged to push for mail-in voting, which he believes was a key factor in the alleged electoral theft. Kennedy speculated that Communist China, with its significant intelligence and financial resources, could exploit vulnerabilities in the electoral system by producing fraudulent ballots. He emphasized that the Trump campaign would need an overwhelming number of votes to counteract potential fraud and secure a win in 2024, given the inadequate safeguards against such interference. Michael Anton, a former National Security Council advisor and a member of the Claremont Institute’s faculty, discussed the broader implications of administrative failures and potential malfeasance. He argued that the lax approach to election security and voter verification laws might be a deliberate strategy rather than mere incompetence. Anton suggested that by creating a lax environment for voting, the administration ensures that election fraud becomes easier to execute, with local party figures contributing to the outcome without a centralized directive. He also highlighted the role of the Transition Integrity Project, which, according to him, planned to challenge the legitimacy of a Trump victory through various means, including media manipulation and legal tactics. The conversation also touched on the potentially radical implications of the Biden administration’s policies, with Anton criticizing Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential pick as a signal of confidence in the current system’s ability to secure an advantageous outcome for Democrats, regardless of the public or political response. Both Kennedy and Anton urged their audience to remain vigilant and proactive, emphasizing the importance of grassroots efforts, such as whistleblower programs and increased scrutiny, to prevent election fraud and ensure fair voting processes. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  In a discussion hosted by Lara Logan, filling in for Steve Bannon, Dr. Keith Rose provided insights into the geopolitical developments in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal. Logan emphasized the importance of the First Amendment and highlighted the lack of media coverage on Steve Bannon’s imprisonment. Dr. Rose, with extensive experience in U.S. intelligence, shared significant revelations about Afghanistan, particularly concerning a meeting that occurred a year before the U.S. pullout. This meeting included Chinese military, diplomatic, and intelligence officials with the Afghan Ministry of Defense. Rose disclosed another pivotal meeting shortly before the U.S. withdrawal, involving high-ranking individuals such as CIA Director Burns, Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, Chinese intelligence officials, Iranian Republican Guard Corps, and Pakistani representatives. Rose questioned the presence of these individuals, especially since Haqqani had a bounty on his head and a history of violence against Americans. He noted the peculiar security arrangements, including the use of a tier-one group rather than CIA personnel, and the opaque nature of these discussions. Dr. Rose highlighted the consequences of these meetings in the current geopolitical landscape, stating, “The Afghans have the ability through their passport office to create biometric passports and when people come to Afghanistan to train, they will then kid documentation that will allow them to travel.” He warned that the collaboration between the Taliban and China has led to significant Chinese influence in Afghanistan, affecting military, security, and intelligence sectors. This partnership is a concern for U.S. security, especially with the Taliban reportedly training thousands of jihadis and the potential for these individuals to infiltrate the U.S. through established networks. The discussion underscored the strategic expansion of China in Afghanistan and its implications for U.S. national security and global influence.   Ammon Blair, a former intelligence analyst and Texas Public Policy Foundation fellow, has raised alarms about the escalating relationship between Venezuelan cartels and the Chinese government. According to Blair, this collaboration poses a substantial threat to U.S. national security and has exploited weaknesses in the current administration’s border policies. Blair traces the origins of this alliance back to Hugo Chavez’s strategic partnership with Iran and Cuba in the late 1990s. This network has since expanded to include Russia and China, making Venezuela a central hub in a broader asymmetrical warfare strategy against the United States. “If Americans think that…our adversaries have been sitting back just…allowing America to destroy itself, they haven’t been capitalizing on it,” Blair asserted, emphasizing that this is a coordinated effort involving several hostile parties. The numbers reveal a troubling trend. In 2017, there were only 2,600 Venezuelan apprehensions at the U.S. border. By 2023, that number surged to 334,000, indicating a dramatic increase in migration due to Venezuela’s internal collapse under Maduro’s regime. While many Venezuelans are fleeing genuine crises, Blair warns that the Venezuelan government has deliberately emptied prisons, releasing criminal elements to infiltrate the United States. Blair explained how these released individuals form a transnational criminal organization, benefiting from U.S. policies on open borders. He described it as “political theater” by the Venezuelan government, as they position cartel leaders for global influence rather than meaningful reform. “The Mexican cartel has really already built a Silk Road for them,” Blair noted, highlighting how this infrastructure is used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to support their operations in the United States. The link between Venezuelan and Mexican cartels, especially the violent CJNG cartel, creates a direct threat to American communities, contributing to increased violence in cities like New York, Chicago, and Dallas. This collaboration has essentially created a conduit for the CCP’s interests, using Mexican cartels as proxies in their broader strategy of unrestricted warfare against the U.S. “The Chinese have weaponized Mexican cartels and used them as proxies in their unrestricted warfare on the United States,” Blair stated, underscoring the critical nature of this alliance. The implications are far-reaching, affecting not only border security but also the fabric of American society. Blair’s analysis calls for urgent attention and action, as these threats are no longer confined to the borders but have penetrated into everyday American life. His insights reveal a complex web of geopolitical alliances that demand a strategic and robust response from U.S. policymakers.  George Pond, a policy expert and Texas native, discussed the pressing issue of the Chinese-Mexican cartel alliance and its implications for U.S. security. Pond highlighted the fictional novel “Cartel Wars” by Dr. Richard Funk, which explores this dangerous collaboration. The novel envisions a scenario where Mexican cartels, supported by China, invade the U.S., with the narrative focusing on an invasion of Texas and its impact on American resilience. Pond emphasized that the book reflects real concerns about border security and geopolitical threats. He noted, “The book captures the essence of what could happen if we remain complacent about the growing threat from these alliances.” He connected the fictional narrative to recent events, drawing parallels with global conflicts and the vulnerabilities exposed by America’s open border policies. Pond’s discussion underscores the urgent need to address these emerging threats. He warned of a broader strategic challenge, stating, “We have been under an invasion for a long time,” referring to the ongoing impacts of drug warfare, human smuggling, and threats to critical infrastructure. His remarks suggest that understanding and addressing these risks are crucial for safeguarding national security and preparing for potential future conflicts. </div>
